The Donghua drive chain program
All Donghua British Standard (BS) and Donghua American Standard (ANSI) fulfil and 
perform according the International ISO606 DIN8187 and DIN8188 standard. These 
drive roller chains are designed and developed to meet the International requirements by 
Original Equipment Manufacturers and fulfil the expectations in the Maintenance Repair 
and Overhaul companies. The unique Quality Price performance, the wear resistance, 
fatigue resistance and average breaking load which is +25% above the norm, offer our 
clients a durable and reliable transmission component.
This Donghua Standard Range is used in a very wide range of applications in different 
machines and industries. Besides the pure transmission function, the use of standard 
rollers chains is changing more and more to the materials handling equipment for 
conveying applications. Therefore our seamless rollers and the optimum crushing 
strength of our rollers offer a long-lasting and secure performance in all kinds of 
conveying applications. Another application is for linear motion. Our standard roller 
chains can be used as a gear-rack in different linear applications. Donghua Standard 
and Special roller chains are also used for chain couplings with and without housings.
Despite the fact that all our Standard roller chains are pre-lubricated, maintenance 
lubrication is recommend. There is however one exception, because all our Donghua 
Stainless Steel roller chains are not pre-lubricated. Please let us know which kind of 
lubrication you require. We can offer food grade, high temperature or low temperature 
lubrication.

Our NEW DONGHUA X3 SERIES is within our Premium Quality product range offering 3 times better wear resistance, fatigue resistance and higher precision than our 
standard range. By using new hardening technologies and special anti-friction coating technology on the pin surface, the coefficient of friction between pin and bush is reduced 
to a minimum. Extreme wear resistance is the result. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex 
and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production 
batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and 
safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking 
load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs 
on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special 
environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please 
contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will 
receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore 
with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please 
see page 302-310.

Our NEW DONGHUA X3 SERIES is within our Premium Quality product range offering 3 times better wear resistance, fatigue resistance and higher precision than our 
standard range. By using new hardening technologies and special anti-friction coating technology on the pin surface, the coefficient of friction between pin and bush is reduced 
to a minimum. Extreme wear resistance is the result. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex 
and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production 
batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and 
safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking 
load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on 
request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environ-
ments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact 
our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive 
a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with 
grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see 
page 302-310.

Our NEW DONGHUA EXL SERIES is within our product Solution Quality range offering better wear resistance, better fatigue resistance and higher precision than our standard 
range. The superior quality, durability and outstanding wear and fatigue resistance are realized by the new wide waist design of the plates, solid bushes and solid rollers and 
special highly sophisticated long lasting lubricant. EXL easy dis- & reassembly through built-in Donghua’s Easy Break Technology. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, 
Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, 
pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and 
packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length 
service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which 
are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high 
temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For 
drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet 
and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with 
pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper 
bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua CP roller chains are built with hard chromized pins. The surface hardness is more than 1100 HV10 offering a +30% higher wear resistance than standard case 
hardened pins. Donghua CP roller chain are used for tough environments, high speed, high frequency of movement in the bearing area resisting wear much better than case 
hardened pins. In combination with highly sophisticated lubricant this technology brings a unique performance in wear resistance. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, 
Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, 
pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and 
packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length 
service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which 
are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high 
temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs.
For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data 
sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller 
chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed 
bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua CP roller chains are built with hard chromized pins. The surface hardness is more than 1100 HV10 offering a +30% higher wear resistance than standard case 
hardened pins. Donghua CP roller chain are used for tough environments, high speed, high frequency of movement in the bearing area resisting wear much better than case 
hardened pins. In combination with highly sophisticated lubricant this technology brings a unique performance in wear resistance. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, 
Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, 
pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and 
packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length 
service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which 
are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high 
temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For 
drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet 
and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with 
pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper 
bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua ZT coated roller chains are coated by a zinc aluminium compound. This coating is also known as Zintek coating layer and is used with many different steel product 
to protect the steel product from corrosion. This ZT coating has proven to have extremely high corrosion resistance. Even compared to zinc plating or nickel plating which 
are standard finish treatments used for roller chains and conveyor chain, this ZT coating gives a better corrosion protection in many corrosive environments. All Donghua 
roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 
DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller 
chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are 
available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available 
on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please 
ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales 
team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on 
page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets 
are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are 
possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua ZT coated roller chains are coated by a zinc aluminium compound. This coating is also known as Zintek coating layer and is used with many different steel product 
to protect the steel product from corrosion. This ZT coating has proven to have extremely high corrosion resistance. Even compared to zinc plating or nickel plating which 
are standard finish treatments used for roller chains and conveyor chain, this ZT coating gives a better corrosion protection in many corrosive environments. All Donghua 
roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 
DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller 
chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are 
available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available 
on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please 
ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales 
team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on 
page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets 
are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are 
possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua ZT+ roller chains are coated with the exact same zinc aluminium compound. Only the pins are chemical nickel plated. These chemical nickel plated pins do have a 
surface hardness of 1,000 HV and offer improved wear resistance. The corrosion resistance of these chemical nickel plated pins is excellent. All Donghua roller chains are: 
Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard 
pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic 
bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request.
Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request.
Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for 
a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any 
special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301.  
By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available 
for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot 
bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua ZT+ roller chains are coated with the exact same zinc aluminium compound. Only the pins are chemical nickel plated. These chemical nickel plated pins do have a 
surface hardness of 1,000 HV and offer improved wear resistance. The corrosion resistance of these chemical nickel plated pins is excellent. All Donghua roller chains are: 
Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard 
pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic 
bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request.
Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request.
Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us  
for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for 
any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. 
By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available 
for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot 
bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua ZT+ roller chains are coated with the exact same zinc aluminium compound. Only the pins are chemical nickel plated. These chemical nickel plated pins do have a 
surface hardness of 1,000 HV and offers improved wear resistance. The corrosion resistance of these chemical nickel plated pins is excellent. All Donghua roller chains are: 
Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard 
pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic 
bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request.
Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request.
Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for 
a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any 
special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301.  
By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available 
for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot 
bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Our DONGHUA O-ring SERIES is within our Solution product range offering better wear resistance, better fatigue resistance and higher precision than our standard range. 
The superior quality, durability and outstanding wear and fatigue resistance are realized by an O-ring design between inner and outer plates, solid bushes and solid rollers and 
special highly sophisticated long lasting lubricant. The O-rings and/or X-rings keep the dust and pollution outside the pin/bush area and the long lasting lubricant inside the pin/
bush area. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured 
according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. 
All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 
5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses 
are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length 
tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are 
available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive 
chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life 
time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or 
special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Our DONGHUA O-ring SERIES is within our Solution product range offering better wear resistance, better fatigue resistance and higher precision than our standard range. 
The superior quality, durability and outstanding wear and fatigue resistance are realized by an O-ring design between inner and outer plates, solid bushes and solid rollers and 
special highly sophisticated long lasting lubricant. The O-rings and/or X-rings keep the dust and pollution outside the pin/bush area and the long lasting lubricant inside the pin/
bush area. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured 
according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. 
All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 
5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses 
are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length 
tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are 
available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive 
chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life 
time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or 
special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains meet the high requirements in the food industry. For special food applications there are different food grade lubricants available. 
Please ask our engineering department.  Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains cannot replace standard carbon steel roller chains in the same size. Breaking Load and Wear 
Resistance differ too much. Please ask our engineering department for the right dimensional choice per drive. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant and 
Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are 
manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number 
for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. 
Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request.  Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length 
tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request.  Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 
1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation.  For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different 
kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering 
department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive 
chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard 
toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua SS PLUS Stainless Steel Roller Chain offer a +30% higher wear resistance than normal Stainless Steel Roller Chains. Thanks to the use of hard chromized pins, this 
wear resistance performance is realized. Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains meet the high requirements in the Food industry. For special food applications there are different 
food grade lubricants available. Please ask our engineering department. Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains cannot replace standard carbon steel roller chains in the same 
size. Breaking Load and Wear Resistance differ too much. Please ask our engineering department for the right dimensional choice per drive. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-
loaded, Fatigue resistant and Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and 
triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production 
batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety 
instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length 
tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 
1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of 
special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, 
also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation 
including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened 
toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua Straight Side Plate Roller Chains are built for conveying applications. The load capacity per Donghua Chain is exactly known; please ask our engineering department 
for any calculation examples.  Donghua Straight Side Plate Roller Chains can be delivered in Stainless Steel 304 and 316, Zinc plated, Nickel plated, DR or ZinTek Coating and 
Self-Lubricating versions. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant and Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless 
steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8188, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication 
on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and 
packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length 
service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which 
are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high 
temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For 
drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet 
and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with 
pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper 
bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains meet the high requirements in the food industry. For special food applications, there are different food grade lubricants available. 
Please ask our engineering department.  Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains cannot replace standard carbon steel roller chains in the same size. Breaking Load and Wear 
Resistance differ too much. Please ask our engineering department for the right dimensional choice per drive. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant and 
Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are 
manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number 
for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. 
Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request.  Several test certificates like breaking load, length 
tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 
1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different 
kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering

Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains meet the high requirements in the food industry. For special food applications, there are different food grade lubricants available. 
Please ask our engineering department.  Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains cannot replace standard carbon steel roller chains in the same size. Breaking Load and Wear 
Resistance differ too much. Please ask our engineering department for the right dimensional choice per drive. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant and 
Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are 
manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number 
for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. 
Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request.  Several test certificates like breaking load, length 
tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 
1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different 
kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering 
department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive 
chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard 
toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Donghua’s Heavy Duty Series are designed for tough and demanding applications and environments. The increased plate thickness offers a higher fatigue resistance. In 
combination with straight side plates it offers good wear resistant properties for conveyor applications.  All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear 
resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have 
seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard 
boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available 
on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for 
‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, 
low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain 
calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and 
sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot 
bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. 
Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

All Donghua HV Series roller chains provide up to 20% higher Tensile Strength than the standard ANSI series by using through-hardened pins and links plates. HV Series roller 
chains also provide a higher shock load resistance and are best suited for low operating speeds - up to 50 m/min. Dimensions are identical to the H-Series roller chain. All 
Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to 
ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua 
roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, 
reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible 
and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance 
are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. 
Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain 
calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time 
expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or 
special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

All Donghua HV Series roller chains provides a up to 20% higher Tensile Strength than the standard ANSI series by using through-hardened HV Series roller chains which also 
provides a higher shock load resistance and is best suited for low operating speeds - up to 50 m/min. Dimensions Donghua CP roller chains are built with hard chromized 
pins. The surface hardness is more than 1100 HV10 offering a +30% higher wear resistance. Donghua CP roller chains are used for tough environments, high speed, 
high frequency of movement in the bearing area resisting wear. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua 
simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are 
marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 
DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test 
certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications 
can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food 
application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right

ANSI Series, making them ideal for applications where chain space is limited. Best suited for low speed operating conditions - up to 50 m/min. Donghua CP roller chains 
are built with hard chromized pins. The surface hardness is more than 1100 HV10 offering a +30% higher wear resistance than standard case hardened pins. Donghua 
CP roller chain are used for tough environments, high speed, and high frequency of movement in the bearing area resisting wear much better than case hardened pins. In 
combination with highly sophisticated lubricant this technology brings a unique performance in wear resistance.  All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, 
Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8188, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, 
do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in 
cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is 
available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed 
for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, 
low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain 
calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and 
sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot 
bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. 
Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

The Donghua HSP Series. The thickness of the link plates is the same as the H & HV Series roller chains. The special pin material is also through-hardened which provides a 
higher tensile strength and a higher shock load resistance than SP Series roller chains. The pitch holes are critically formed and ball drifted. HSP Series roller chain can be 
used to replace the next larger size of ANSI standard roller chain, making them ideal for applications where space is limited. Best suited for low speed operating conditions 
- up to 50 m/min.  All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are 
manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8188, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete 
traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging 
size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material 
analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN 
length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants 
are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive 
chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life 
time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or 
special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

Mounting tensioners
Tensioning Chains
These tools are used to tension chains for chain assembling. Due to a mechanical system a threaded axis will create 
translation by rotation. This translation will bring two ends of a chain together. This will make room for the connection link.
The use of a compression spring will give the user more stability.
