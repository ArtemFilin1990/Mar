Generally, slewing bearings are large-size 
rolling bearings that can accommodate axial, 
radial and moment loads acting either singly 
or in combination and in any direction. They 
can perform both slewing (oscillating) 
movements as well as rotational movements.
Basically, a slewing bearing († fig. 1) 
 consists of an inner ring (a), an outer ring (b) 
and rolling elements − balls (c) or cylindrical 
rollers − that are separated by polyamide 
spacers (d). The rings, one of which usually 
incorporates a gear (e), are provided with 
holes (f) to accommodate attachment bolts. 
The holes may be threaded. Generally, only 
the  raceways in the rings (h) are hardened and 
 precision-ground. Integral seals (g) made of 
 acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) keep the 
lubricant in, and contaminants out of the 
bearing. Slewing bearings are relubricated 
Slewing bearings
through grease fittings (i) to reduce main-
tenance and operating costs.
Compared to traditional pivot 
arrangements, slewing bearing arrangements 
provide many design and performance 
advantages. The compactness and large inner 
diameter simplify the design of the bearing 
arrangement and its associated components. 
The low sectional height of these bearings 
means that the pinion lever can be kept short. 
In most cases only flat surfaces on the 
associated components are needed. 
Slewing bearings were originally designed 
to be mounted only on horizontal support 
structures, but can now be used successfully 
in vertical bearing arrangements. The forces 
and load distribution in slewing bearings, 
when subjected to axial, radial and moment 
loads, are shown in figs. 2 to 5.
Slewing bearings perform extremely well 
in a variety of applications such as:
• access platforms
• bucket wheel excavators
• conveyor booms
• cranes of all types
• small, medium and large excavators
• indexing tables
• ladle turrets
• offshore applications
• robots
• railway bogies
• rotary platforms
• stackers
• solar mirrors
• tunnel boring machines
• wind turbines

SKF manufactures slewing bearings in a 
number of types and variants. The most 
 common bearings available from stock or 
within short lead times are:
• single row four-point contact ball 
slewing bearings
• single row crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings
These standard slewing bearings are 
introduced in the following pages and listed 
with their performance data in the relevant 
product tables. Commonly ordered 
customized bearings are listed in separate 
product tables, starting on page 78 and 
page 102.
SKF also manufactures a wide range of 
other types of slewing bearings. A brief 
description of these bearings can be found 
under the heading “Other SKF slewing 
bearings”, starting on page 12. For additional 
information about these bearings, contact

Other SKF slewing bearings
The SKF slewing bearings listed in this 
catalogue represent only a part of the 
comprehensive SKF assortment. These 
bearings, which have an outside diameter 
ranging from 50 to 7 900 mm, are available 
with one-piece rings. Larger bearings with an 
outside diameter up to 14 000 mm have 
segmented rings. For the purpose of this 
catalogue, only examples of these large 
bearings are shown to illustrate SKF’s 
manufacturing capabilities.
Double row cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings
Double row cylindrical roller slewing bearings 
can accommodate heavy axial and radial loads 
as well as high tilting moments, which makes 
them particularly suitable for heavy-duty 
applications. 
The bearings consist of two one-piece rings 
and two independent rows of rollers. The 
rollers are inserted into the bearing via two 
holes in one of the two rings and are 
separated by polyamide spacers. After loading 
the roller set, the holes are closed with a plug 
that conforms to the raceway contour. These 
bearings are normally preloaded and fitted 
with integral lip seals. 
Double row cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings can be manufactured: 
• without a gear
• with an internal gear († fig. 2)
• with an external gear

Double row ball slewing 
bearings
Double row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings offer advantages for applications 
where the associated components may not be 
able to provide the level of stiffness or 
accuracy required by other types of slewing 
bearings.
These bearings consist of two one-piece 
rings and two independent rows of balls. The 
ball set can be a full complement design or 
separated by a window-type steel cage or 
poly amide spacers. The bearings are normally 
preloaded and fitted with integral lip seals.

Triple row roller slewing 
bearings
Triple row roller slewing bearings are an 
excellent choice for heavily loaded 
applications. They provide the highest load 
ratings possible and can accommodate very 
heavy loads and high tilting moments. 
These bearings are combined cylindrical 
roller radial/thrust bearings. They consist of 
one one-piece and one two-piece ring as well 
as two roller sets to accommodate axial loads, 
and one roller set to accommodate radial 
loads. Polyamide cages separate the axially 
loaded rollers. The bearings are not preloaded 
and have integral lip seals. 
Triple row roller slewing bearings can be 
manufactured:
• without a gear
• with an internal gear († fig. 3)
• with an external gear
Triple row roller slewing bearings are sensitive 
to the deflections of associated components. 
As a result, an extremely stiff and accurately 
manufactured support structure is re quired if 
the bearing is to achieve maximum service life.
Combined cylindrical 
roller/ball slewing 
bearings
Combined cylindrical roller/ball slewing 
bearings can accommodate the same heavy 
axial loads as triple row roller slewing bearings 
in one direction only, but cannot accommodate 
the same degree of tilting moments. They are 
suitable for heavy- duty applications, but are 
as sensitive as triple row bearings to surface 
imperfections.
Combined cylindrical roller/ball slewing 
bearings consist of two one-piece rings and 
normally have axial internal clearance. The 
balls are inserted into the bearing via a hole 
in one of the two rings and are separated by 
polyamide spacers.
Combined cylindrical roller/ball slewing 
bearings can be manufactured:
• without a gear
• with an integral gear
• with an external gear († fig. 4)
Fig. 4
Fig. 5
Wire race slewing 
bearings 
SKF offers a wide range of single row as well 
as multi-row ball or cylindrical roller wire race 
slewing bearings. Single row four point 
contact ball wire race slewing bearings 
(† fig. 5) and single row crossed cylindrical 
roller wire race slewing bearings († fig. 6) are 
the most widely used slewing bearing types 
and normally consist of:
• a one-piece and a two-piece bearing ring 
made of aluminium
• four through-hardened wire inserts made 
of bearing steel, forming the raceways
• a cage guided rolling element assembly
Single row wire race slewing bearings are 
recommended for lightweight, precision 
applications. They are 70% lighter than 
similarly sized all-steel bearings, and can 
accommodate light to normal loads and 
significant tilting moments. Furthermore, the 
design of the wire inserts makes these 
bearings relatively insensitive to support 
surface imperfections.
Multi-row wire race slewing bearings, such 
as double or triple row roller bearings, are 
available for heavier load applications.
Wire race slewing bearings can be 
manufactured:
• without a gear
• with an internal gear
• with an external gear

Selection of slewing bearing type
Each slewing bearing type has different 
characteristics based on its design, which 
make it more, or less, appropriate for a given 
application. For example, single row four-point 
contact slewing bearings have a simple and 
 sturdy design that makes them cost-effective, 
while crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings are used when accuracy and rigidity 
are key operational parameters or when zero 
operational clearance or preload is required.
Because several factors have to be 
considered when selecting a slewing bearing 
type, no general rules can be provided. 
The information provided here are the 
most import ant factors to be considered 
when selecting a standard bearing type. 
 Factors include:
• accuracy
• magnitude and direction of loads
• permissible operating temperature
• vibration
• operating speed
• sealing
A brief overview of the standard slewing 
bearing types and their suitability for a 
particular application can be found in table 1.
Selecting the appropriate slewing bearing 
can be a challenge, particularly if there are 
stringent technical, reliability or economic 
demands. In these cases, for example, it is 
advisable to consult the SKF application 
engineering service during the initial design 
phase. This service can do much more than 
help select a bearing. They can also provide 
expert advice in any of the following areas:
• design optimization
• lubrication systems
• sealing arrangements
To provide the SKF application engineering 
service with the information they need to help 
find the best technical solution for your 
application, SKF has developed a 
questionnaire, which can be found on 
page 32.

Accuracy
When preloaded, SKF crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings provide a high degree of 
stiffness, due to the large roller/raceway 
contact area. These bearings, which have a 
high degree of running accuracy, are typically 
used when accurate positioning is a key 
operational parameter. Four-point contact ball 
slewing bearings have a lower degree of 
stiffness. 
Magnitude and direction of loads
The magnitude of the load is one of the factors 
that usually determine the size of the bearing 
to be used. Generally, four-point contact ball 
slewing bearings are able to withstand heavy 
loads and shock loads. They can be adapted 
for slewing applications where heavy loads 
vary in magnitude and direction. 
Using the static limiting load diagram, 
together with the bearings listed in the 
product tables, the required bearing size can 
be estimated using the resulting axial bearing 
load and the magnitude of the tilting moment. 
Permissible operating temperature
The permissible operating temperatures for 
slewing bearings listed in this catalogue are 
determined primarily by the spacer and seal 
material and the grease used for lubrication. 
The permissible operating tempera ture 
typically ranges from –25 to +70 °C. If slewing 
bearings are required to operate outside the 
reference temperatures, contact the SKF 
application engineering service. Also contact 
the SKF application engineering service if the 
outer ring has a lower temperature in 
operation than the inner ring, which might 
lead to reduced internal clearance or increase 
the preload in the bearing.

Operating speed
SKF four-point contact ball slewing bearings 
generate less friction than crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings. Consequently, four-
point contact ball slewing bearings also have 
a higher speed capability. These bearings can 
accommodate tangential operating speeds up 
to 4 m/s. Crossed cylindrical roller bearings 
are limited to approximately 1,5 m/s for 
continuous slewing motion and up to 2 m/s for 
brief periods.
Vibration
For applications subjected to vibrations, 
preloaded four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings are typically used. However, crossed 
cylindrical roller slewing bearings are also 
suitable. In cases where sufficient experience 
with a similar bearing arrangement is not 
available, it is strongly advised to consult the 
SKF application engineering service. 
Sealing 
The selection of a seal is vital to the performance 
of a slewing bearing. The standard seals used 
in SKF slewing bearings provide good protection 
against moisture and contaminants and also 
provide reliable retention of the lubricant. 
These integral seals are not intended to 
protect bearings that operate under extreme 
conditions where, for example, they are 
exposed to water, vacuum, high levels of 
abrasive contaminants, or radiation. For these 
types of applications, additional external seals 
must be used to prevent media from entering 
the bearing cavity.

Selection of slewing bearing size
The size of a slewing bearing can be based 
initially on the dynamic and static load ratings 
of the bearing, in relation to the applied loads 
and the requirements regarding reliability and 
service life. Values for the axial dynamic load 
rating C and axial static load rating C0 are 
quoted in the product tables. 
When determining the most efficient and 
economical slewing bearing for a specific 
application, SKF recommends taking the 
 following into consideration:
• loads acting on the bearing
• frequency of oscillating movements
• type of application
• bearing size most suitable for the 
application
• torque applied to the gear
Determining bearing loads
The loads and moments acting on a slewing 
bearing from the inherent weight of the 
components that it carries, and the other 
inertia forces, are either known or can be 
calculated. Assuming the conditions cited in 
fig. 1, the resulting loads and moments 
applied to the bearing can be estimated, using 
the following equations: 
Fa = Qa + G1 + G2 + G3
Mt = Qa ¥ L + Fr ¥ Hr + G3 ¥ L3 − G1 ¥ L1 − G2 ¥ L2
where
Fa = resulting axial load applied to the 
bearing, kN
Fr = external radial load applied to the 
bearing, e.g. work/wind force, kN
G1 = weight fraction 1, e.g the 
counter weight, kN
G2 = weight fraction 2, e.g. the weight 
of the cabin, kN

If it is necessary to calculate the basic rating 
life*, contact the SKF application engineering 
service. SKF also recommends confirming the 
results by contacting the application 
engineering service once calculations and the 
selection process are complete.
*) The basic rating life is the result of a calculation that 
indicates the time a bearing can operate before the first 
sign of metal fatigue occurs on one of its rings or rolling 
elements.

Fr, m
L = distance from the centre of rotation to 
the centre of the lifting load, m
L1 = distance from the centre of rotation to 
the centre of gravity of the weight

L2 = distance from the centre of rotation to 
the centre of gravity of the weight 
fraction 2, m
L3 = distance from the centre of rotation to 
the centre of gravity of the weight 
fraction 3, m
Mt = resulting tilting moment acting on the 
bearing, kNm
Qa = lifting load, kN
In applications where the working radii L and 
L3 for the lifting load and the adjustable boom 
vary, the maximum working radii have to be 
used to calculate the maximum tilting 
moment Mt acting on the bearing. 
External radial loads Fr may be neglected as 
long as they are ≤ 5% of the axial load. If these 
radial loads are acting at any point other than 
the plane of the bearing, the resulting tilting 
moment should be calculated and taken into 
consideration. If the radial loads exceed the 
ratio Fr/Fa = 0,6, it is advisable to contact the 
SKF application engineering service.
Determining bearing size
When determining bearing size using the static 
limiting load diagrams, additional forces should 
be taken into account. Which forces to consider 
depend on the type and mode of operation of 
the machine and operational requirements 
regarding service life and reliability. This is done 
by multiplying the resulting axial load and tilting 
moment by a load factor fL as listed in table 1:
Far = fL ¥ Fa
Mtr = fL ¥ Mt
where
Far = maximum rated axial load, kN
Fa = resulting axial load applied to the 
bearing, kN
Mtr = maximum rated tilting moment, kNm
Mt = resulting tilting moment acting on the 
bearing, kNm
fL = load factor († table 1)
Using the calculated values for the maximum 
rated axial load Far and the maximum rated 
tilting moment Mtr , the requisite slewing 
bearing size can be obtained from the 
appropriate static limiting load diagram, 
shown together with the slewing bearings in 
the product tables. Each diagram contains two 
curves per bearing; the solid line shows the 
raceway capacity and the dotted line shows 
the bolting capacity († fig. 2). The points, 
where the plotlines of rated axial load Far and 
the rated tilting moment Mtr intersect, must 
always be below the capacity curves, i.e. inside 
the green zone. If the points of intersection

effects on its running behaviour.
Bolting capacity
Bolting capacity applies to the supported 
bearing and the number of 10.9 strength 
grade (EN ISO 898) nuts and bolts used to 
anchor the bearing to its support surface. For 
these capacities to be valid, the threads of all 
bolts and nuts must be coated with a thin layer 
of light oil and tightened according to the 
recommended values in table 1 “Tightening 
torque and preload of attachment bolts” on 
page 24.

Selection example
A slewing bearing with an internal gear has 
to be selected for a mini excavator, which is 
exposed to the following operating conditions:
• resulting axial load applied to the bearing 
Fa = 65 kN
• external radial load applied to the bearing 
Fr = 12 kN
• resulting tilting moment acting on the 
bearing Mt = 120 kNm
The following is considered:
• the value for the load ratio 
Fr/Fa = 12/65 = 0,184 lies within the 
 permissible range Fr/Fa ` 0,6. 
Therefore, any series of four-point contact 
ball or crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearing can be used.
• with fL = 1,33 the maximum rated axial load 
and maximum rated tilting moment is 
calculated: 
Far = fL ¥ Fa = 1,33 ¥ 65 = 87 kN
Mtr = fL ¥ Mt = 1,33 ¥ 120 = 160 kNm
• using Far = 87 kN and Mtr = 160 kNm, 
a bearing that adequately meets the needs 
of the application can be obtained from 
the product tables:
– medium size four-point contact ball 
 slewing bearing with an internal gear, 
page 70: RKS.062.20.1094
– medium size crossed cylindrical roller 
 slewing bearing with an internal gear, 
page 94: RKS.162.14.1094
In applications where stiffness is important, 
the crossed cylindrical roller slewing bearing 
RKS.162.14.1094 is the best choice; 
otherwise the four-point contact ball slewing 
bearing RKS.062.20.1094 is suitable for this 
task.

Application of slewing bearings
A slewing bearing arrangement consists of 
a single bearing that can accommodate axial 
and radial loads as well as tilting moments 
acting either singly or in combination and in 
any direction. To fully utilize these bearings, 
each of the following design considerations 
must be met:
• the bearing rings must be fully supported 
around their complete circumference and 
across the entire width of the axial side 
 faces by strong and rigid associated 
 components († fig. 1)
• strength grade 10.9 attachment bolts 
are used (EN ISO 898)
• the bearing is properly sealed
Associated components
To facilitate proper functioning of a slewing 
bearing arrangement, the support structure 
must be sufficiently strong and rigid. 
Furthermore the, flatness of the support 
surfaces must be within defined limits. For 
additional information about flatness 
tolerances, refer to pages 22 and 23.
Support structure
Support structures are typically welded 
frames or castings. Thick-walled cylindrical 
structures with an inside or outside flange 
provide better results than thin-walled 
fabricated structures with a trussed frame 
(† fig. 2). Moreover, the arrangement of the 
walls of the sub- and superstructure should 
correspond with the rolling element assembly, 
to optimize power transmission.

associated components

The flange must support the bearing ring 
across its entire side face. The thickness of the 
support flange († fig. 3) should be in 
accordance with the following guideline 
values:
• S ≥ 0,05 ¥ dm, for bearings with a mean 
raceway diameter ≤ 500 mm
• S ≥ 0,04 ¥ dm, for bearings with a mean 
raceway diameter > 500 mm and 
≤ 1 000 mm
• S ≥ 0,03 ¥ dm, for bearings with a mean 
raceway diameter > 1 000 mm 
The requisite minimum wall thickness 
(† fig. 3) of the structure can be estimated 
using 
S1 = 0,35 ¥ S
where
S = thickness of the support flange, mm
S1 = wall thickness of the structure, mm
dm = mean raceway diameter of the 
bearing, mm († product tables)
Support surfaces
Slewing bearings have limited rigidity, due to 
their relatively small cross sectional height 
compared to their diameter. The support 
structure should therefore be designed for 
maximum axial and radial rigidity. The support 
surfaces must be flat and free from rust, paint 
or burrs. Machining is mandatory and the 
surface roughness should be within the limits 
Ra = 3,2 to 6,3 mm. Additionally, the support 
surfaces should be thoroughly washed and 
dried before mounting to provide the proper 
frictional joint between the support surface 
and the bearing surface. Be sure that the 
support surfaces are not covered with 
a preservative or coated with oil or grease! 
Before bolting each bearing ring to its 
support surface, it is essential to check the 
total axial run-out and flatness of the 
machined support surfaces, since a low 
section slewing bearing will be distorted by 
any irregularities. The flatness should be 
compared to that of an ideal plane surface. 
The deviations in height between measuring 
points of the actual surface drawn over the 
ideal plane are illustrated in fig. 4. The 
following parameters should be checked prior 
to mounting.
Overall flatness tolerance
The tolerance of the overall flatness in a 
circumferential direction of the support 
surfaces († fig. 4) is limited to
tc = (dm + 1 000)/10 000
where
tc = maximum permissible deviation 
from flatness, mm
dm = mean raceway diameter of the 
bearing, mm

Flatness in the circumferential 
direction
The flatness variation, the difference between 
the measurements of two consecutive points, 
as well as the variation in inclination († fig. 5), 
is of great importance. It is measured by 
dividing the circle into small segments of the 
length “n” smaller or equal to the distance of 
the attachment bolt hole. 
Deviations in the same direction away from 
the nominal plane, such as measurements “tca” 
and “tcb”, or “tcc” and “tcd” between two 
consecutive points, should not exceed the 
guideline value
tca – tcb ≤ 0,0002 ¥ n
If however, the inclination changes direction, 
as at point P in figure 5, the sum of the 
deviations, such as measurements “tcb” and 
“tcc”, should not exceed the guideline value
tcb + tcc ≤ 0,0002 ¥ n
where
tca – tcb = permissible flatness variation 
between 2 consecutive 
measurements, where inclination 
is constant, mm
tcb + tcc = permissible flatness variation 
between 2 consecutive 
measurements, where inclination 
changes direction, mm
n 
= distance between two consecutive 
measuring points, mm
Flatness in the radial direction
Flatness in the radial (transverse) direction, 
e.g. the conicity († fig. 6), measured across 
the width of the support surface is limited to
tt = B / 1000
where
tt = permissible deviation of axial run-out in 
the radial (transverse) direction, mm
B = width of the support surface, mm
In applications where it is not possible to 
obtain the permissible tolerances, contact the 
SKF application engineering service.

3) Bolt preload corresponding to coefficient of friction in the thread mG = 0,14
4) Bolt preload to 90% of the yield point stress. For torsion free tightening, use an HYDROCAM bolt tensioner
Attachment bolts
Hexagonal head bolts in accordance with 
DIN EN ISO 4014:1999 in the 10.9 strength 
grade (EN ISO 898) are suitable for securing 
slewing bearings to their support structures. 
The minimum clamp length of bolted joints 
(† fig. 7) should be
LK = 5 ¥ G
where
LK = the minimum length of bolt joint, mm
G = the bolt thread diameter, mm
Surface pressure in bolt joints
For 10.9 strength grade bolts and nuts, SKF 
recommends using hardened or quenched 
and tempered flat washers beneath the bolt 
head and nut, to avoid excessive surface 
pressure on the support surfaces. Spring 
washers of any type should never be used. 
The recommended tightening torque values 
for nuts and bolts are provided in table 1. 
Under normal operating conditions, the 
recommended bolt torque values will provide 
a reliable and safe connection to the support 
surface and the application. However, when 
the arrangement is subjected to very heavy 
loads, shock loads and/or vibrations, consult 
the SKF application engineering service.
Calculation of bolted joints
The SKF rules to calculate bolted joints are 
based on experience in practice and 
standardized calculation rules. When 
considering slewing bearing arrangements, a 
distinction has to be made between supported 
or suspended bearings († figs. 2 and 3 on 
page 9). In the case of suspended bearing 
arrangements, consult the SKF application 
engineering service.

Sealing arrangements
The efficiency of the sealing arrangement has 
a decisive influence on the service life of every 
bearing. SKF slewing bearings are normally 
equipped with contact seals made of acrylo-
nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), which seal 
against the shoulder or the side face of the 
inner or outer ring († fig. 8). 
Depending on the application and the envir-
onmental conditions, a secondary seal might 
be necessary to prevent solid contaminants 
and moisture from penetrating into the 
bearing. This secondary seal, for example, 
might be a large V-ring, which is commercially 
available († fig. 9). It could also be designed 
as a sheet steel cover, bolted to either the 
rotating or stationary part of the bearing 
arrangement († fig. 10).

Slewing bearing gear
Generally, one ring of a slewing bearing 
comprises a 20° involute cylindrical gear 
(† fig. 1). These gears have been proven to be 
the most suitable for heavily loaded slewing 
bearing arrangements running at low speeds. 
The module, the number of teeth, the reference 
diameter and, where necessary, the addendum 
modification of the gear are listed in the product 
tables. The permissible tooth forces are also 
listed in the product tables and are valid for 
unhardened gears, where
Tfnormal = tangential tooth force for normal 
operating loads based on fatigue 
stress at the tooth base
Tfmax = maximum permissible tangential 
tooth force, based on fracture at the 
the tooth base
To provide proper gear performance, the 
pinions also should be furnished with a 20° 
involute spur gear. There is a choice between 
two types of pinion drive arrangements 
(† fig. 2): 
• a drive pinion fixed in relation to the slewing 
bearing axis (a)
• a drive pinion that rotates around the 
bearing axis (b)
Gear backlash
Backlash is defined as the smallest gap 
between the trailing face of the driving tooth 
and the leading face of the tooth behind it on 
the driven gear († fig. 3). Gear backlash 
should be checked after positioning the pinion. 
The measurement should be made at the 
position where there is a blue marking on the 
gear († bearing markings from page 40 to 
page 45). This mark indicates:
• the point of the largest distance to the 
 centre, for a bearing with an external gear
• the point of the shortest distance to the 
centre, for a bearing with an internal gear
Fig. 2

---

This blue marking should face the pinion when 
determining backlash. To do this, insert the 
blade of a feeler gauge between two teeth 
(† fig.3). Applicable backlash values are 
 provided in table 1. If the attained values are 
not within the guideline values, correct 
backlash by adjusting the centres of the 
gearwheels. Otherwise, there will be excess 
pressure between the two sets of gear teeth. 
Practical experience has shown that zero 
backlash can produce structural overloads, 
which will significantly reduce gear life.
Table 1 shows the recommended minimum 
backlash values for satisfactory meshing 
under heavy load. On a position of the 
bearing’s circumference other than at the blue 
marking, higher backlash can occur. This is 
due to normal form tolerances and has no 
negative impact.
Pinions
The most commonly used pinions are 
hardened and ground. They should extend 
past the bearing gear on both sides by 
approximately 5 mm. 
Additionally, a tip relief of 0,01 ¥ module is 
recommended († fig. 4) to avoid meshing 
interference, which may occur at the tooth 
root area of unhardened bearing gear teeth 
driven by a hardened pinion. This type of wear 
(† fig. 5), which manifests itself as increased 
noise, is not really harmful. The degree of 
wear will become progressively smaller and 
the noise level should decrease.

Lubrication
For a slewing bearing to function properly and 
provide maximum service life, proper 
relubrication and regular maintenance 
intervals are essential. The primary function of 
a lubricant is to create an oil film between the 
rolling elem ents and raceways as well as 
between the gears, to prevent metal-to-metal 
contact.
Slewing bearings are generally lubricated 
with grease, which also provides added 
protection against the ingress of water and 
contaminants.
As slewing bearings normally operate at 
slow speeds, the free space between the rings 
can be filled entirely with grease.
Bearing lubrication
Unless otherwise specified, SKF slewing 
bearings are filled with an NLGI class 2 
mineral oil based EP-grease containing a 
lithium soap thickener. This grease provides 
extremely good corrosion inhibiting properties 
and excellent mechanical stability. The grease 
has a temperature range of –20 up to 
+110 °C. Reliable lubrication according to the 
SKF traffic light concept is in the operating 
temperature range of +30 to +110 °C.
SKF recommends relubricating slewing 
bearings with SKF LGEP 2, a mineral oil based 
grease with a consistency of 2 on the NLGI 
scale. In special cases, where the bearing 
must operate reliable at low temperature, an 
NLGI grease with a consistency of 1 or 0 can 
be used.
Information about appropriate SKF greases 
can be found in table 1.
Slewing bearings should be greased 
immediately after mounting, until fresh grease 
starts to escape from the seals around the 
whole circum ference. 
Gear lubrication
The gear of a new bearing is normally coated 
with a preservative but is not greased.
After the bearing has been mounted, a 
lubricant needs to be applied to the gear. This 
lubricant, which is usually grease, should have 
• a base oil viscosity of at least 500 mm2/s at 
40 °C
• good adhesive properties
• a high resistance to water washout.
In addition, the grease should be able to 
withstand temperatures of at least +100 °C.

Relubrication intervals 
and quantities
Bearings
Relubrication should always be undertaken at 
a time when the condition of the existing 
lubricant is still satisfactory. This time depends 
on many related factors including bearing type 
and size, operating temperature, frequency of 
operation, grease type and the bearing 
environment. In order to facilitate good grease 
distribution, the bearing should always be 
relubricated while it is in operation. 
The relubrication interval tf for the raceway 
of slewing bearings mounted on a horizontal 
support structure under normal and clean 
conditions can be obtained from the blue line 
of diagram 1, as a function of the number of 
operating hours per week.
The relubrication interval tf is an estimated 
value, valid for an operating temperature of 
70 °C, using a good quality grease. If there are 
severe operating conditions, such as very dirty 
or damp environments or if operating 
temperatures exceed 70 °C, more frequent 
relubrication may be necessary. For additional 
information, contact the SKF application 
engineering service.
The quantity of fresh grease depends on 
the bearing size. Suitable quantities for single 
row slewing bearings can be obtained from 
the red line of diagram 2 as a function of the 
mean raceway diameter.
The new grease must be identical to, or 
miscible with, the grease already contained 
in the bearing. A mixture of two immiscible 
greases will impair the efficiency of the 
lubricant.
Gears
The relubrication interval, tf, for the gears can 
be obtained from the red line of diagram 1  
as a function of the number of operating hours 
per week.
Before regreasing the gear, the teeth should 
be cleaned of any impurities.
 The lubricant can be brushed or sprayed 
onto the gear or by any other suitable method, 
e.g. a SKF lubricating pinion († fig. 3 on 
page 31). The grease quantity depends on the 
method chosen.

Relubrication procedures
Manual relubrication
Light series and medium size bearings can 
be relubricated through four equally spaced 
cone type grease fittings to DIN 71412:1987, 
design A, in the inner and/or outer ring 
(† fig. 1). Appropriate grease guns are 
 available from SKF. Additional information 
about SKF maintenance products can be 
found in the publication MP3000 “SKF 
Mainten ance and Lubrication Products” or 
online at www.mapro.skf.com.
Automatic relubrication
An automatic relubrication system is typically 
used when the calculated relubrication 
interval is very short, e.g. due to 
contamination, or when the bearing is not 
easy to access.
When using automatic relubrication, check 
whether the grease can be adequately 
pumped through the ducts at the prevailing 
ambient temperature.
Automatic lubrication can be achieved via 
single-point automatic lubricators, multi-
point lubricators or centralized lubrication 
systems, depending on the demands of the 
application. SKF SYSTEM 24 is a single-point 
lubricator that can be screwed directly into 
one of the threaded holes used for grease 
fittings († fig. 2). SKF SYSTEM Multipoint can 
lubricate up to 8 lubrication points and is 
refillable. Additional information about SKF 
automatic lubricators can be found in the 
publication MP3000 “SKF Maintenance and 
lubrication products” or online at www.mapro.
skf.com. Centralized lubrication systems 
(† fig. 3) typically  consist of:
• grease pumps (1), one to grease the 
bearing and one to grease the gear,

General information
It takes skill and experience to maximize 
bearing performance and reduce the risk of 
premature failures. Experience means 
choosing the correct mounting method and 
using the correct tools for the job. 
The information provided in the following 
section is quite general and primarily identifies 
the factors that must be considered in order to 
facilitate the mounting process. 
The information is valid for single row 
 slewing bearings used in typical applications. 
For additional information, contact the 
SKF application engineering service.
Mounting should, wherever possible, be 
carried out in a dry, clean environment. When 
slewing bearings have to be mounted in an 
unprotected area, which is often the case, 
steps should be taken to protect the bearing 
and its associated components until 
installation is complete. 
As is the case with all bearings, never hit the 
rings or seals directly with a hammer or any 
other hard object. Also, never apply a 
mounting force directly through the rolling 
elements.
Preparations for mounting 
Before mounting, all necessary parts, tools, 
equipment and data need to be on hand. SKF 
also recommends checking all drawings and 
instructions to determine that each 
component is assembled in the correct order. 
Bearing handling
To reduce the risk of injury, wear gloves when 
mounting slewing bearings.  Also, use carrying 
and lifting tools that are specially suited for 
mounting such bearings.
Slewing bearings should be transported 
and stored flat on a surface that extends over 
the whole side face of the bearing († fig. 1). 
When the bearing is to be moved or held in 
position, appropriate lifting tackle should be 
used († fig. 2). Eyebolts, for example, should 
only be subjected to a load in the direction of 
the shank axis. Also, keep in mind when using 
eyebolts that the hole size is limited and only 
designed to accommodate the weight of the 
bearing. The bearing should never be 
weighted down with tools or associated 
components. Slewing bearings should never 
be suspended from a single point using a sling 
or one bolt, because the rings are relatively 
thin-walled and the weight of the bearing 
could deform the rings. 
Like other rolling bearings, slewing bearings 
should remain in their original, unopened 
package until immediately before mounting so 
that they will not be exposed to contaminants 
like dirt unnecessarily. The preservative 
coating applied to a new bearing from the 
factory should be removed from side faces 
that will be in contact with the support 
surface.
Bearing markings 
To facilitate correct installation, the inner and 
outer rings of SKF slewing bearings are 
marked on one side face according to fig. 3. 
A red marking and the letter “F” indicate 
a small unhardened area in the raceway – the 
soft zone on the raceway between the 
beginning and end of induction hardening. 
Whenever possible, this area coincides with 
the position of the hole that is needed for ball 
or roller loading and is closed with a plug.
To facilitate backlash adjustment, a blue 
marking and the letter “B” on the geared ring 
locates the smallest gap between two teeth.
A black marking on a bearing with a low 
sectional height relative to its diameter, 
indicates the minimum out-of-roundness of 
the assembled bearing.

Attachment bolts
Only bolts and nuts as specified in the tech-
nical documents or mounting instructions 
should be used. Recommendations are 
provided in the chapter “Attachment bolts” on 
page 22.
Under normal operating conditions and 
when the recommended flat washers are 
used, the recommended bolt torque values 
provide a reliable and safe connection to the 
support surface and the application.
Tightening methods
All bolts and nuts should be tightened with 
a highly accurate torque wrench († fig. 4) or a 
hydraulic bolt tensioner († fig. 5) in at least 
two stages as described in the section 
“Mounting recommendations” († fig. 40). 
SKF recommends that whenever possible, the 
bolts should be tightened using an 
HYDROCAM hydraulic bolt tensioner. This 
hydraulically operated bolt tensioner enables 
bolts to be installed accurately without 
applying torque. The tensioner also enables
• bolted joints with uniform preload on all 
bolts
• the optimum exploitation of the yield 
strength of the bolt
• the use of high-strength bolts.
The HYDROCAM bolt tensioner was designed 
specifically to install the bolts on slewing 
bearings. These tensioners are available in 
four different designs. The standard bolt 
 tensioner († fig. 5) consists of
• a skirt (a)
• a hydraulic body (b)
• a brace (c)
• a socket for standard nuts (d) 
to hand  tighten the nut.
For additional information about HYDROCAM 
bolt tensioners, contact the SKF application 
engineering service.

Correct mounting of a slewing bearing 
depends on the design of the application 
and the type of slewing bearing. The following 
information is quite general, but provides 
basic information proven in the field. For 
additional information, contact the SKF 
 application engineering service.
1 Remove any burrs on the seat surfaces 
with emery cloth or a honing tool 
(† fig. 1). 
2  Clean the seat surfaces with compressed 
air. Make sure that the surfaces of the 
support structure and the bearing are 
clean  and dry († fig. 2). 
3 Check the form accuracy of the support 
structure († fig. 3) according to the 
information in the section “Associated 
components” starting on page 21.
4 Position the bearing on the first support 
surface. The red marking F on the ring 
must be arranged at a 90° angle to the 
axis of the maximum loaded zone, 
provided that the axis can be determined 
or estimated († fig. 4).

5 Adjust the bearing so that the bolt holes in 
the ring coincide with those of the support 
structure. Check that the bearing is level 
over the entire seat surface († fig. 5). 
6 Coat the bolt threads with a thin layer of 
light oil. 
7 Fit the bolts, washers and nuts and 
manually tighten them († fig. 6). 
8 In a first round, tighten the bolts or nuts 
(† fig. 7) to between 40 and 50 % of the 
prescribed value, following the tightening 
pattern († fig. 8). In a second round, fully 
tighten the bolts or nuts to the prescribed 
preload, following the tightening pattern.

9 Check for correct installation by turning 
the “free” ring († fig. 9). The torque, which 
might be high due to preload, grease and 
friction of the seals, should not show any 
excessive variation or “tight spots” during 
rotation. If the torque varies excessively, 
check the ovality of the bearing, and correct 
if necessary.
10 Position the second support structure with 
its support surface on the free bearing 
ring. The red marking F on this ring must 
be at 180° from the red marking F of the 
mounted ring († fig. 10). 
11 Adjust the position of the support structure 
so that the bolt holes coincide with those of 
the bearing ring. 
12 Coat the bolt threads with a thin layer of 
light oil.
13 Fit the bolts, washers and nuts and tighten 
them, following steps 7 and 8. 
14 Check the installation by rotating the 
assembled bearing arrangement. The 
torque should not show any excessive 
 variation or “tight spots” during rotation 
(† fig. 11).
15 Measure the tilting clearance of the 
installed bearing in the main load line with 
the aid of a dial gauge by applying a 
defined tilting moment († fig. 12). Check 
180° from the measuring point to be sure 
that the radial clearance is virtually zero. 
Mark the measuring points on the adjacent 
component and note the measured 
clearance on the installation report.

16 For geared slewing bearings, check the 
backlash, using a feeler gauge, after pos-
itioning the pinion (fig. 13). The 
measurement has to be made at the blue 
mark on the bearing gear, which indicates 
the point where the backlash is smallest. 
Required values for backlash are listed in 
table 1 on page 29. If these values are not 
attained, correct the backlash by adjusting 
the distance between the centres of the 
gear wheels.
17 Supply grease to the raceway via the grease 
fittings provided in one of the bearing rings 
(fig. 14). If applicable, rotate the bearing 
during the greasing operation. If a 
centralized lubricating system will be used, 
connect the lubricating tubes to the bearing. 
18 Lubricate the gear. († fig. 15)

Trueing up
This section applies only to slewing bearings 
with a mean raceway diameter above 
2 000 mm and having a black marking on 
each ring.
1 Align the black markings by rotating 
one of the rings († fig. 16).
2 Measure the ovality of each ring at 6 points 
(30° intervals), e.g. on the centring 
 diameters d1c, d2c, D1c, or D2c, respectively 
(† fig. 17). The ovality of a bearing ring 
should not exceed 0,5 mm for bearings with 
a mean raceway diameter between 2 000 
and 3 000 mm.
3 Trueing up the bearing is achieved through 
elastic deformation of the bearing rings. To 
reduce the ovality, only small adjustments 
are required, which can be achieved by 
means of small jacks († fig. 18) or a star 
shaped tool.
4 After trueing-up, tighten the bolts of the 
adjusted ring to the prescribed preload 
(† fig. 4),  following the mounting 
recommendations starting on page 40. 
5 Remove the adjustment tool († fig. 19). 
6 Check for correct mounting by turning the 
“free” ring († fig. 20). The torque, which 
might be high due to preload, grease and 
friction of the seals, should not show any 
excessive variation or “tight spots” during 
rotation. 
Note: The tools that can be used for trueing-up the bearing are 
rather simple. They can consist, for example, of a bar with 
adjustable screws at the ends, to expand the inner ring. Only 
minimal pressure should be applied against the bearing rings.

Inspection
As with all important machine components, 
slewing bearings should be cleaned and 
inspected regularly. Maintenance intervals 
depend entirely on the operating conditions. In 
applications where there are heavy loads and/
or high levels of contamination, decrease the 
time between inspections.
To avoid accidents or injuries during the 
inspection process, be sure that the moving 
part of the slewing bearing arrangement is 
balanced and that no tilting moments or  radial 
loads are present.
Inspecting axial tilting 
clearance
To determine and record wear in slewing 
bearings, SKF recommends checking the axial 
tilting clearance after 2 000 operating hours, 
or at least once a year. Since there is a definite 
relationship between raceway wear and 
increased axial clearance, measure the axial 
clearance prior to operation. This is normally 
done during the bearing installation process 
(† fig. 1). The results of the first and any 
subsequent measurements should be noted 
and recorded as a graph.
For applications where measurement of 
the axial tilting clearance is not possible, the 
bearing height reduction († fig. 2) can be 
used to define raceway wear: 
DHw = Hs0 – Hs1
where
DHw = bearing height reduction, mm
Hs0 = bearing height after installation, mm
Hs1 = bearing height after operation, mm
Also, in this case, measurement values of the 
bearing height are needed after installation 
and prior to start-up. The procedures used to 
take measurements should be the same each 
time. Guideline values for the permissible 
bearing height reduction as a function of the 
rolling element diameter are listed in table 1. 
For additional information, contact the SKF 
application engineering service.

Inspecting bolt joints
Special attention must be paid to the bolt 
joints. Depending on the application, all bolts 
need to be retightened between the third week 
and twelve weeks of operation. († fig. 3).
Before start-up after an extended period 
of machine downtime, after 2 000 oper ating 
hours or at least once a year, all attachment 
bolts of a slewing bearing arrangement should 
be retightened. In cases where
•  a bolt has lost 20% or more of the 
prescribed preload, then the actual bolt(s) 
as well as the two adjacent ones, must be 
replaced
• at least 20% of the bolts of a single ring 
are found to have less than 80% of the 
 prescribed preload, then all the bolts 
must be replaced. 
Never loosen or exchange more than one 
bolt at a time. Use the same tightening  method, 
the same tools and the same type of bolts 
employed originally.
Seal inspection
The seals or sealing arrangements should be 
inspected at least every six months during 
normal maintenance. If necessary, clean the 
seals and if there are signs of damage, replace 
the seal to prevent any contaminants from 
entering the bearing. 
Furthermore, check that there is always a 
sufficient amount of grease around the entire 
circumference of the sealing lip († fig. 4). 
Note: The instructions for inspecting bolt joints should not be 
considered as a substitute for standards that may apply in 
countries where the slewing bearings are operated. When 
replacing a slewing bearing, always replace the bolts too.

Storage
Slewing bearings can be stored in their ori-
ginal package († fig. 1) for approximately one 
year, provided that the relative humidity in the 
storeroom does not exceed 60% and there is 
no vibration and no great fluctuation in 
temperature.
If slewing bearings have to be stored for 
periods longer than one year, this has to be 
specified when ordering, because special 
provisions have to be made during packaging 
(† fig. 3). 
The protection of the bearing enables 
storage at about 20 °C at a maximum relative 
humidity of 75% during the time mentioned 
on the label attached to the packaging.
Slewing bearings should only be stored lying 
flat on a surface where the entire side face is 
supported († fig. 2). If stored in the upright 
position, the weight of the rings and rolling 
elements can result in permanent 
deformation.
For additional information about storage, 
contact the SKF application engineering 
service.

Product data – general
General
Single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings are simple in design. They are 
particularly versatile and offer many 
advantages for applications where there are 
light-to-medium axial, radial and moment 
loads.
Single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings are the most widely used slewing 
bearing type. SKF manufactures them in 
many executions and sizes.
The bearings listed in the following product 
tables represent only a part of the single row 
four-point contact ball slewing bearings that 
are manufactured by SKF on a regular basis or 
within short lead times.
The actual SKF manufacturing range of 
customized single row four-point contact ball 
slewing bearings is much more extensive than 
what appears in the product tables.
Each custom variant is designed to 
accommodate special technical demands, 
which include but are not limited to:
• special ring material 
• load carrying ability
• speed capability
• custom bolt patterns
• running accuracy
A customized slewing bearing that meets your 
specific requirements might already exist. 
As a result, SKF recommends contacting the 
application engineering service very early in 
the design stage so that SKF engineers, with 
their in-depth product and application know-
ledge, can help you find the most suitable 
bearing arrangement for your  application.
Design
Single row four point contact ball slewing 
bearings consist of a one-piece inner and 
outer ring and a set of spacers, protected by 
integral seals. The balls are inserted into the 
bearing via a hole in one of the two rings and 
are separated by polyamide spacers. After 
loading the ball set and spacers, the hole is 
closed with a plug that conforms to the 
raceway contour.
The SKF range of single row four-point 
contact ball slewing bearings is divided into 
three series:
• light series four-point contact  
ball slewing bearings
• medium size four-point contact  
ball slewing bearings
• customized four-point contact  
ball slewing bearings

Axial clearance
Single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings are manufactured as standard with 
an internal axial clearance as listed in table 4, 
enabling them to compensate for slight 
imperfections in associated components, 
including the support surface. 
Material
The rings of light series and medium size 
 single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings up to a mean raceway diameter of 
1 094 mm are made of C 45 E tempered steel, 
in accordance with EN 10083-2:2006. Single 
row four-point contact ball slewing bearings 
with a mean raceway diameter larger than 1 
094 mm are made of 42CrMo4 bearing steel 
for induction-hardening, in accordance with 
EN 10083-3:2006.
The rings of customized single row four-
point contact ball slewing bearings listed in the 
product tables, starting on page 78 are made 
from a modified heat-treatable 42 C 2 steel, in 
accordance with NFA 35-557:1983, or 46Cr2 
steel, in accordance with EN 10083-3-2006.
The inner and outer ring raceways are 
induction hardened, leaving the remainder of 
the rings, including the gears, unaffected 
by the hardening process. 
The balls are made of 100Cr6 bearing steel 
for through-hardening, in accordance with EN 
ISO 683-17:2000.
Corrosion protection
Single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings are protected, as standard, by a 
 solvent-free rust inhibitor.

Gears
The gear teeth are manufactured to an SKF 
specification that closely follows accuracy grade 
12 in accordance with ISO 1328-2:1997 and 
are not hardened. Guideline values for the 
permissible tooth forces can be obtained from 
the product tables. 
The gear of a new bearing is coated with a 
preservative. After mounting has been 
completed, lubricant needs to be applied to 
the gear. This lubricant should have good 
adhesive properties and a high resistance to 
water washout. Additionally, the lubricant 
must be able to withstand temperatures of 
+100 °C and has to have a base oil viscosity of 
at least 500 mm2/s at +40 °C.
Seals
The integral seals are made of profiled strips 
of non-reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene 
rubber (NBR). They seal axially against the 
side face of the inner or outer ring 
(† fig. 5a, b) or radially against the cylin drical 
surface of the inner or outer ring († fig. 5c). 
This material has very good engineering 
properties and shows good resistance to most 
mineral oils and greases. The permissible 
operating temperatures of the seal material 
range from –40 to +110 °C.

Lubrication
Standard SKF single row four-point contact 
ball slewing bearings are filled with a mineral 
oil based grease with a consistency of 2 on the 
NLGI scale using a lith ium soap  thickener and 
containing extreme pressure additives. The 
base oil viscosity is 200 mm2/s at 40 °C and 
16 mm2/s at 100 °C. This grease has good 
rust inhibiting properties and a tem perature 
range of –20 up to +110 °C. Reliable 
lubrication according to the SKF traffic light 
concept occurs when operating temperatures 
range from +30 to +110°C.
Light series and medium size single row 
four-point contact ball slewing bearings can 
be relubricated through four equally spaced 
grease fittings to DIN 71412:1987:
• in the inner ring of bearings with an 
 external gear († fig. 6a)
• in the outer ring of bearings with an internal 
gear († fig. 6b)
• in the outer ring of bearings without a gear
Relubrication features of customized slewing 
bearings († fig. 6c) depend on the needs of the 
application. For additional information, contact 
the SKF application engineering service.
Guidelines to determine relubrication 
intervals for slewing bearings in vertical 
arrangements under normal and clean 
conditions are provided in the chapter 
“Lubrication”, starting on page 28.

Product data – general
General
Single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings are simple in design, consisting of a 
one-piece inner and outer ring and cylindrical 
rollers separated by polyamide spacers and 
generally protected by integral seals.They can 
accommodate heavy radial loads and medium 
axial loads as well as tilting moments. These 
SKF slewing bearings are intended for bearing 
arrangements where stiffness is important or 
zero operational clearance or preload as well 
as constant resistance to rotation are required. 
Single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings require tighter specifications for the 
flatness and stiffness of the support surface 
than single row four-point contact ball slewing 
bearings. 
 Due to the wide range of applications for 
single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings, SKF manufactures them in many 
executions and sizes that are available from 
stock or within short lead times. The actual 
SKF manufacturing range of customized 
bearings is more extensive than what appears 
in the product tables. SKF manufactures a 
variety of customized single row crossed 
cylindrical roller slewing bearings to meet the 
demands of particular applications. 
Customized executions can include special 
ring materials and unique bolt patterns. Load 
carrying ability, speed capability, and/or 
running accuracy can also be customized.
A customized slewing bearing that meets 
your specific requirements might already exist. 
Therefore, SKF recommends contacting the 
application engineering service very early in 
the design stage so that SKF engineers, with 
their in-depth product and application know-
ledge, can help you find the most suitable 
bearing arrangement for your application.
Designs
Single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings consist of a one-piece inner and 
outer ring and a set of cylindrical rollers and 
spacers, protected by integral seals. The 
cylindrical rollers are inserted into the bearing 
via a hole in one of the two rings and are sep-
arated by poly amide spacers. The axis of 
rotation of adjacent rollers are at 90° to each 
other. After loading the roller set and spacers, 
the hole is closed with a plug that conforms to 
the raceway contour. 
The SKF range of single row crossed 
cylindrical roller slewing bearings is divided 
into:
• medium size single row crossed  cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings
• customized single row crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings
86

---

Medium size single row 
crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings
SKF medium size single row crossed cylin-
drical roller slewing bearings are compact, 
with strong, full-size rings. Depending on the 
size, they are available with two different fixed 
cross-sections within each of the three series.  
To simplify installation, the inner and outer 
rings have a standardized number of equally 
spaced holes for attachment bolts.
The standard SKF single row medium size 
crossed roller slewing bearings († fig. 1) 
listed in the product tables include bearings 
with a mean raceway diameter ranging from 
414 to 1 904 mm and are available with any 
of the following gear configurations:
• with an external gear (a), RKS. 161 series 
designation 
• with an internal gear (b), RKS. 162 series 
designation
• without a gear (c), RKS. 160 series 
designation
These slewing bearings are available from 
stock or within short lead times. For up-to-
date information about availability, contact the 
SKF application engineering service. 
SKF medium size crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings feature a unique and cost-
effective combination of load carrying ability, 
stiffness, and speed capability. These features 
open a wide application field for medium size 
crossed cylindrical roller slewing bearings. 
Typical applications include, but are not limited 
to, earth moving, construction and ma terial 
 handling equipment as well as robotics.
Medium size crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings can be operated 
continuously at circumferential speeds of up 
to 1.5 m/s and up to 2 m/s for brief periods.

Customized single row 
crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings
SKF manufactures single row crossed 
cylindrical roller slewing bearings in a variety 
of executions and sizes to meet the needs of 
particular applications.
The customized SKF single row crossed 
cylindrical roller slewing bearings († fig. 2) 
listed in the product tables include bearings 
with a mean raceway diameter ranging from 
310 to 2 200 mm and are available with any of 
the following gear configurations or options:
• with an external gear (a)
• with an internal gear (b)
• without a gear (c)
• with (c) or without centring recesses
These customized bearings represent only 
a few designs and sizes, which are 
manufactured on a regular basis or within 
short lead times. Before incorporating a 
customized bearing in an application design, 
contact the SKF application engineering 
service for availability.
Depending on design, size and accuracy, 
customized single row crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings can be operated at 
circumferential speeds of up to 1,5 m/s and up 
to 2 m/s for brief periods. For applications that 
will operate at higher speeds than those listed 
in the tables, contact the SKF application 
engineering service.

Bearing data – general
Dimensions
The boundary dimensions of single row 
crossed cylindrical roller slewing bearings are 
dictated by practical application requirements 
and do not comply with any international or 
national standard. Medium size bearings up to 
and including 1 094 mm mean raceway 
diameter are dimensionally interchangeable 
with competitors’ products.
Tolerances
The dimensional and running accuracy of SKF 
single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings are listed in: 
• table 1: Diameter tolerances († fig. 3)
• table 2: Tolerances of tip circle and 
attachment bolt hole diameters († fig. 3)
• table 3: Running accuracy
The tolerance for the total height H is ±1 mm 
for all single row crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings.
Axial clearance, preload
Crossed cylindrical roller slewing bearings are 
manu factured with zero clearance or preload.
Material
The rings of medium size crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings up to a mean raceway 
diameter of 1 094 mm are made as standard 
of C 45 E tempered steel, in accordance with 
EN 10083-2:2006. Crossed cylindrical roller 
slewing bearings with a mean raceway dia meter 
larger than 1 094 mm are made of 42CrMo4 
bearing steel for induction hardening, in 
accordance with EN 10083-3:2006.
The rings of customized crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings listed in the product 
tables starting on page 102 are produced 
either from
• a modified heat-treatable 42 C 2 steel, 
in accordance with NFA 35-557:1983, 
or 46Cr2 steel, in accordance to EN 
10083-3-2006
• a 42CrMo4 bearing steel for induction hard-
ening, in accordance with EN10083-3:2006
Inner and outer ring raceways are surface 
induction-hardened while leaving the 
remainder of the rings, including the gears, 
unaffected by the hardening process.

1) Radial runout of the centring of inner or outer ring of assembled bearing
2) Axial runout of the mating surface of inner or outer ring of assembled bearing
The cylindrical rollers are made of 100Cr6 
bearing steel for through-hardening, in 
accordance with EN ISO 683-17:2000. 
Corrosion protection
Single row crossed cylindrical roller slewing 
bearings are protected, as standard, by a 
solvent free rust inhibitor.
Gears
The gear teeth are manufactured to an SKF 
specification that closely follows accuracy grade 
12 in accordance with ISO 1328-2:1997 and 
are not hardened. Guideline values for the 
permissible tooth forces can be obtained from 
the product tables. 
The gear of a new bearing is coated with 
a preservative. After mounting has been 
completed, lubricant needs to be applied to 
the gear. This lubricant should have good 
adhesive properties and high resistance to 
water washout. Additionally, the lubricant has 
to withstand at least temperatures of +100 °C 
and has to have a base oil viscosity of 
500 mm2/s at +40 °C or higher.
Seals
The integral seals are made of profiled strips 
of non-reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene 
rubber (NBR). They seal axially against the 
side face of the inner or outer ring († fig. 4a) 
or radially against the cylindrical surface of the 
inner or outer ring († fig. 4b). This material 
has very good engineering properties and 
shows good resistance to most mineral oils 
and greases. The permissible operating 
temperatures of the seal material range from 
–40 to + 110 °C.
Lubrication
Standard SKF single row crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings are filled with a 
mineral oil based grease with a consistency of 
2 on the NLGI scale using a lithium soap 
thickener and containing extreme pressure 
additives. The base oil viscosity is 200 mm2/s 
at 40 °C and 16 mm2/s at 100 °C. This grease 
has good rust inhibiting properties and a 
temperature range of –20 up to +110 °C. 
Reliable lubrication according to the SKF 
traffic light concept occurs when operating 
temperatures range from +30 to +110°C.

Medium size single row crossed cylindrical 
roller slewing bearings can be relubricated 
through four equally spaced grease fittings 
A M 10¥1 to DIN 71412:1987:
• in the inner ring of bearings with an 
 external gear († fig. 5a)
• in the outer ring of bearings with an internal 
gear († fig. 5b)
• in the outer ring of bearings without a gear
Relubrication features of customized slewing 
bearings († fig. 5c) depend on the needs of 
the application. For additional information, 
contact the SKF application engineering 
service.
Guidelines to determine relubrication 
intervals for slewing bearings in vertical 
arrangements under normal and clean 
conditions are provided in the chapter 
“Lubrication”, starting on page 26.
Designation system
The designation system for SKF medium size 
crossed roller slewing bearings consists only 
of a few figures, the significance of which is 
described in table 5. 
The designation system for SKF customized 
slewing bearings consists of several figures 
and is described briefly in table 6 "Designation 
system of customized slewing bearings" on 
page 59.
