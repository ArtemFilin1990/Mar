Consultation
On the basis of long experience in the practical application of 
machine components, GMN provides comprehensive consultation 
and services in the field of high precision ball bearings regarding 
the following topics (amongst others):
• Bearing selection, bearing calculation, service life calculation
• Tribology, lubrication, lubricant selection
• Optimizations for special applications
• Special solutions
“Globus“ calculation software
The correct bearing for a particular application can be selected 
quickly and easily using the Globus calculation software. It helps 
with frequency analyses and has its own extendable lubrication 
database.
Bearing analysis
GMN offers comprehensive methods for bearing analysis such as 
the following (amongst others):
• Noise test
• Metrological analysis
• Microscopic analysis
• Lubricant analysis
Training courses
GMN provides qualified training courses in theory and practice 
for high precision ball bearings and their applications, both at 
customer locations and also at our premises. 
The costumer-specific contents of the training courses are se-
lected from the following topics:
• Basics: products, designs, ...
• Engineering: nomenclature, bearing selection, ...
• Assembly: control measurements, lubrication, ...
• Bearing analysis: methodology, analysis options at GMN, ...

Types of bearings
GMN produces spindle and deep groove ball bearings in the pre-
cision classes P4/ABEC 7 to P2/ABEC 9 for applications with the 
highest demands. Their reliability, precision and quality set the 
standard internationally.
The large product range of spindle bearings and wide variety 
of bearing series and sizes, with bore sizes from 5 – 120 mm, 
always provides an optimum solution for customers with regard 
to loading, rigidity, speed and service life.
The KH spindle bearing series can be supplied as open version for 
oil lubrication or as sealed version with for-life grease lubrication.
GMN high precision ball bearings are available with contact angle 
C, E or as special design with 18° contact angle.
Special bearings / Bearing systems
From idea to solution
In addition to the main program, GMN also offers the possibi-
lity to find new solutions thanks to its engineering and flexible 
manufacturing areas. The products range from special bearings to 
ready-to-install bearing systems. 
Technical benchmarks that are founded on detailed basic develop-
ments are set for various applications:
• Touchdown bearings
• Vacuum technology / Turbomolecular pumps
• Medical technology / X-ray
• Measurement / Navigation technology
• Bearing systems
• Machine tool applications
Cages 
GMN high precision ball bearings are available with TA cages made 
of textile reinforced phenolic resin or as TXM cages made of PEEK 
(polyetheretherketone).
Materials 
GMN bearings with rings and balls made of ball bearing steel 
100Cr6 (SAE 52100) are used in many applications. Hybrid 
bearings with rings made of 100Cr6 and balls made of silicon 
nitride Si3N4 are often a technical and economic alternative 
for applications with high speeds and loads. All bearings can be 
supplied as hybrid version.
Technology 
GMN: proven success
The continuous development of key competences, committed em-
ployees, a focus on quality and the careful selection of suppliers 
are guarantees of delivery dependability and quality.
The use of the most modern technology such as CBN grinding, 
hard turning and PVD sputtering form the basis for flexible solu-
tions at the cutting edge of technology.
Innovative cost-optimised products demand the application of 
modern methods like 6-Sigma, TEM, SEM, as well as the close col-
laboration with customers, universities and competent business 
partners.
