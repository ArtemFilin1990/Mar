SPECIAL FABRICATIONS ON REQUEST
 6
V-Belt with PVC NAP coating
Available in the trapezoidal or cogged versions.
The Gripface coating is used to gain an increased surface coefﬁ cient 
of friction. This is particularly useful to control products at high speeds 
or in inclined or declined applications. This cover is resistant to com-
mon lubricant oils and water.  
V-Belt with rubber NAG coating
Available in the trapezoidal or cogged versions.
The Gripface coating is used to gain an increased surface coefﬁ cient 
of friction. This is particularly useful to control products at high speeds 
or in inclined or declined applications. Widely used on packaging 
machines. This cover is very wear resistant.
V-Belt with aramide felt surface 
Available in the trapezoidal or cogged versions.
The coating used for conveying hot products, giving high heat resi-
stance and a  lower friction coefﬁ cient.
V-Belt with TENAX surface
Available in the trapezoidal or cogged versions.
The coating is used for conveying abrasive materials. The coating 
offers a high friction coefﬁ cient and excellent wear resistance.
V-Bel
