INTRODUCTION
EXTRA SMALL SERIES
Extra small bearings are available in the 30 Metric Series, the 33 and S Inch Series 
and the F Flanged Series. These bearings can sustain radial, thrust and combined 
loads proportionate to the capacities of the small shafts for which they are designed. 
They are appropriate for use in fractional horsepower motors, precision instruments, 
domestic appliances, ﬁlm projectors and similar devices.
The F ﬂanged series has external shoulders with the bearing for mounting in 
through-bored housings. This series is used where compactness is essential or where 
it is not feasible to machine housing shoulders.
All series in the extra small family include shielded versions. The 30 Metric Series 
is also available with felt seals, Mechani-Seals and rubber seals, while the 33 and 
S Inch Series is available with rubber seals.
Some sizes in the Extra Small Series are manufactured from stainless steel.
EXTRA SMALL 33 AND S SERIES BUSINESS MACHINE BEARINGS
Standard and special extra small bearings are available and often used in business 
machine applications. They include clamp-type collar bearings for slip-ﬁt mounting 
on shafts, bearings with Wireloc in the outer ring, and rubber cushioned “O” series 
with special housed units. 
EXTRA LIGHT 9300 AND 9100 SERIES
Bearings in the Extra Light 9300 and 9100 Series are ideally suited for applications 
where housing diameters are restricted and it is desirable to maintain relatively large 
shaft diameters. Both series are made in the Conrad or non-ﬁlling slot construction 
with the 9300 Series having a somewhat thinner section.
The 9100 Series is generally available with shields, rubber seals and snap ring 
combinations. The 9300 Series is selectively available with two rubber seals. Machine 
tools, textile machinery and jet engine gear boxes are some of the end products in 
which these series have found wide use.
LIGHT 200 SERIES 
Bearings in the 200 Series have a greater section height than the Extra Light 9300 and 
9100 Series bearings and feature a close dimensional balance between bore, outside 
diameter and width. These characteristics make them well-suited for a broad range of 
applications involving light to medium loads combined with relatively high speeds.
Their versatility has made them a popular design choice of designers and has 
resulted in many variations in the series. They are available in either the Conrad or 
maximum capacity type and with shields, rubber seals, Mechani-Seals, felt seals or 
a combination of shield and seal. Snap ring combinations are also included.
Wide-type 200 Series rubber seal (W200PP) and Mechani-Seal (W200KLL) bearings 
are made with standard bores and outside diameters, but in widths equal to the 
corresponding sizes of double-row bearings. This series offers a larger support area 
for shaft and housing contact and extra space for lubricant.
MEDIUM 300 SERIES
The 300 Series radial ball bearings are similar in construction to the 200 Series, but 
have considerably heavier cross sections throughout. They provide greater radial and 
thrust capacity and are able to withstand heavier shock loads.
Because of their rugged construction, these bearings are particularly suited 
for heavy-duty applications like those found in large electric motors, woodworking 
machinery and gear boxes. This series includes both Conrad and maximum capacity 
designs as well as shielded, sealed and snap ring variations.
In the 300 Series wide-type, rubber seal (W300PP) and Mechani-Seal (W300KLL) 
bearings are made with standard bores and outside diameters, but in width equal to 
the corresponding sizes of double-row bearings.

XLS AND EXTRA LARGE 100 SERIES
Bearings in the inch-dimension XLS Series and metric-dimension Extra Large 100 
Series have extra large diameters and a compact cross section. XLS bearings are 
made in the Conrad and maximum capacity ﬁlling slot designs. The Extra Large 100 
Series offers the maximum capacity, ﬁlling slot and counterbore types.
TRI-PLY SEAL DISK HARROW BEARINGS
Bearings with Tri-Ply Seals are designed for service involving severe contamination, 
such as disk harrows, disk tillers and other seed preparation equipment and certain 
conveyor applications. Tri-Ply sealed units come in two designs – one consisting of 
three Timken rubber seals separated by steel spacers and retained by steel caps in 
the outer ring and the other, a highly effective one-piece, molded seal design. Both 
designs have an exterior shroud cap to protect the seals and reinforce the exceptional 
sealing action of the complete unit. A patented notched seal groove design, provided on 
selected sizes, is one of the most positive seal retention methods ever developed.
HEX BORE BEARINGS
These bearings are designed for either outer or inner ring rotation in low speed, 
moderately loaded applications such as farm machinery and conveyors. Their chief 
advantage is ease of mounting. Except for axial positioning by adjacent parts, no 
collars, setscrews or other external parts are required to lock the inner ring to the 
hex shaft.
R-SEAL DISK HARROW BEARINGS
R-Seal bearings are designed for a wide variety of farm machinery applications 
where single-lip positive contact seals are required. Each sealing element has a 
Timken Fafnir rubber seal that effectively seals the bearing with a heavy ﬂare on the 
cylindrically ground O.D. (inner ring). A steel back-up plate supports the seal rubber 
and prevents the seal lip from inverting. An outside metal shroud cap gives maximum 
abrasion protection to the rubber element and completes the assembly that is rolled 
into the outer ring seal groove for positive retention.
R-Seal radial ball bearings are used in positions in planting, cultivating and harvesting 
machinery. They are available in various conﬁgurations including round bores in metric 
and inch dimensions and cylindrical and spherical outside diameters.
ANGULAR CONTACT – SINGLE-ROW 7000 PRODUCT FAMILY
Timken offers a 7200WN Light, 7300WN Medium and 7400WN Heavy Series single-
row, angular contact bearings, which are designed for combination loading with 
high-thrust capacity in one direction.
The 7000WN bearings are manufactured with better than ABEC 1 inner ring bore 
tolerances and ABEC 3 running accuracy. These bearings, when mounted in a duplex 
arrangement, provide axial and/or radial rigidity in applications where control of shaft 
displacement is essential.
These bearings are available with various cage designs as defined in the 
dimension tables. The external dimensions of all 7000WN bearings interchange with 
corresponding sizes in the 200, 300 and 400 single-row radial series.
ANGULAR CONTACT – DOUBLE-ROW
Double-row Angular Contact Bearings are available in the Light 5200 and Medium 
5300 Series. These bearings have the same bores and outside diameters as the 
corresponding sizes in the 200 and 300 Series, single-row, radial type.
Chief advantages of the double-row type are rigidity, compactness and high 
capacity. The two rows of balls provide for bearings large radial capacity combined 
with moderate thrust capacity in either direction.
Double-row bearings are available in both the Conrad (K) construction with 
uninterrupted race shoulders and the maximum capacity type. The latter has a ﬁlling 
slot in the shoulder of both rings and a maximum ball complement.
Sizes with the W sufﬁx have the ﬁlling slot on one side only. In these cases, thrust 
should be applied on the side opposite the ﬁlling slot.

ST FLANGETTE UNIT
s  Pressed steel housed units designed for light-duty applications.
s  Available in shaft sizes from 6.35 mm - 12.7 mm (1/4 to 1/2 inch).
s  Designed to simplify mounting on side plate or frame-type housings.
s  Two identical steel stampings house a clamp-type bearing with a 
spherical O.D. outer ring.
s  Spherical inside surface of each stamping mates with the spherical 
O.D. of the bearing, providing initial self-alignment at mounting.
s  Offers features of basic clamp-type bearing.
s   Available with sealed or shielded construction.
s  Radial load capacity is 25 percent of basic bearing’s dynamic load 
rating at 33.3 RPM.
s  Inspected to ABEC-1 tolerances, except bore.
s  Suggested shaft tolerance: Nominal bore size to -.0005 in. resulting in 
.000 in. to .001 in. loose-shaft ﬁt.
RTF-RUBBER TIRE FLANGE HOUSED UNIT
s  Synthetic, conductive elastomer of Durometer hardness 80-85 
facilitates mounting of standard cylindrical O.D. bearings in side plate 
of frame-type housings. 
s  Generous taper on entrance corner of rubber cartridge simpliﬁes 
insertion of unit into side panel, assuring reasonable squareness of 
bearings when fully mounted.
s  Bearing is positioned by integral ﬂange of the rubber cartridge.
s  Resiliency of elastomer accommodates wider than the standard 
suggested housing bore tolerance. 
s  Greater ﬂexibility in adjusting to minor shaft and/or housing alignment.
s  Helps reduce airborne noise and structural vibration.
s  Additional advantages are similar to features of basic clamp-type 
bearing design.
s  Due to deﬂection characteristics of the elastomer, radial and thrust 
ratings for the RTF Series are 10 percent of the basic bearing’s 
dynamic load rating at 33.3 RPM.

LIGHT 200W SERIES
s  200W Series, maximum capacity type, is dimensionally interchangeable 
with the 200K type, but has greater capacity for supporting heavier radial 
loads and light thrust loads in either direction. 
s  Maximum capacity bearings feature a ﬁlling slot in shoulder of each 
raceway to assemble an extra-large complement of balls. 
s  Consult your Timken representative for the availability of sizes other than 
those listed here.

LIGHT, WIDE TYPE W200PP SERIES W200KLL SERIES
s   Rubber seal (W200PP) and Mechani-Seal (W200KLL) types.
s  Made with standard bores, standard outside diameters and 
a single row of balls.
s  Same widths as double-row bearings of corresponding size. 
s   Extra width offers a larger support area for shaft and housing 
contact and added space for prepacked lubricant. 
s  Wide-type rubber seal bearings are particularly suited for use 
in electric motors, where they simplify housing design by  
eliminating auxiliary seals.
s   Wide-type Mechani-Seal ball bearings are designed for 
applications where frictionless sealing and large grease  
capacity are required. 
s  Extremely effective grease retention and exclusion of foreign 
matter are assured by close running clearance between the  
seal members and slinger action of the outer member.

MEDIUM 300K SERIES
s  A heavier cross section than the 200 Series.
s   Capable of carrying considerably heavier radial, thrust and 
combined loads for a given bore size.
s  Capable of withstanding heavy shock loads. A ball bearing of 
heavier cross section is rarely required.
s  Uses Conrad-type bearing that is well-balanced, with deep 
races and uninterrupted race shoulders. 
s  Electric motor quality where quietness is a requirement.

MEDIUM 300W SERIES
s  A heavier cross section than the 200 Series.
s  Capable of carrying considerably heavier radial, thrust and 
combined loads for a given bore size. 
s  Capable of withstanding heavy shock loads. A ball bearing of 
heavier cross section is rarely required.
s  300W Series bearings are dimensionally interchangeable with 
the 300K Series. However, bearings within the 300W Series are 
capable of carrying heavier radial loads, due to their larger ball 
complements.

MEDIUM, WIDE TYPE W300PP SERIES AND W300KLL SERIES
s  The W300PP (rubber seal) Series and the W300KLL 
(Mechani-Seal) Series have the same bores and outside  
diameters as standard 300 Series ball bearings.
s  Widths are equal to 5300 Series double-row ball bearings. 
s   Added width provides extra support on shafts and in housings 
and eliminates the need for locknuts and lockwashers on  
applications such as electric motors.
s  Prepacked with the right amount of long-life, factory-
ﬁltered grease. 
s   These series incorporate the same advantages as the 
standard width Mechani-Seal and rubber seal bearings.
s   Electric motor quality for applications where quietness 
is a requirement.

HEX BORE BEARINGS
t Designed to be used for outer or inner ring rotation in 
low-speed, moderately-loaded applications, primarily in 
agricultural implements and conveyors. 
t Tolerances of the hex bore are suitable for mounting on  
cold rolled hex shafting.
t Main advantage is ease of mounting. Except for axial 
positioning by adjacent parts, no collars, setscrews or other 
locking devices are required to lock the inner ring to the  
hex shaft. 
t Utilize the R-Type shroud seal.

7000WN PRODUCT FAMILY      
INTRODUCTION
The high performance 7000WN Angular Contact Product Family 
is speciﬁcally designed to support heavy thrust loads at lower 
operating temperatures at high speeds. Included in the angular 
contact series are the following design features:

s  ,OWER OPERATING  s  ,OW SHOULDER INNER AND OUTER  temperatures 
 rings improve oil ﬂow
A feature of this series is the reﬁned bore diameter tolerance. 
The closer bore tolerance in the WN product family reduces the 
broad range of interference and thus prevents the development 
of undesirable high preload in mounted duplex pairs. As a result, 
longer bearing life is achieved and high operating temperatures 
are avoided.
This product family can support heavy thrust loads by combining 
high shoulders on the thrust side of both rings with a high operating 
angle. In addition, uniformity of load per ball under combined loads 
is more favorable with a high contact angle and results in longer 
bearing life.
 Maximum clearance between the one-piece brass or bronze 
cage and the land diameters of both rings is achieved in the WN 
construction. Utilizing low shoulder diameters on the non-thrust 
sides of inner and outer rings promotes efﬁcient oil passage through 
the bearing resulting in lower operating temperatures and longer 
bearing life.
The 7000WN Product Family is divided into several designs. 
Sizes 7207-7218WN and 7304-7318WN have a 40 degree contact 
angle and a one-piece, ball-piloted, pressed brass cage. Sizes 7219-
7230WN and 7319-7330WN have a 40 degree contact angle and a 
one-piece, outer ring-piloted, high-strength machined bronze cage. 
The 7412WN and 7415WN both have a 40 degree contact angle and 
a one-piece conical, high-strength machined bronze cage.
The 7000WN Product Family is available as single bearings and 
duplex sets. A single with the sufﬁx “SU” is ﬂush ground on both 
faces for universal mounting. Such bearings can be used as singles 
or duplex mounted back-to-back (DB), face-to-face (DF) or tandem 
(DT), depending on the functional requirements of the design. The 
mounting of duplex ”SU” bearings will result in a preload range of 
minimum internal clearance to a solid preload.
Bearings without the ”SU” designation are not ﬂush ground 
and are intended to be used as singles. These bearings are used 
to support thrust from one direction and are often accompanied 
by a preload spring.
Bearings with the sufﬁx ”DU” are ﬂush ground on both faces for 
universal mounting. A duplex pair of ”DU” bearings can be mounted 
(DB, DF, or DT), depending on the functional requirements of the 
design. These bearings, after mounting, will result in a range of 
positive light preload.

MOUNTING ARRANGEMENTS
APPLICATIONS
These design features are advantageous in applications such 
as oil reﬁning pump systems where higher productivity and longer 
system life is important. Other applications where these features are 
equally suited are deep well pump motors, vertical and horizontal 
pumps, worm gear and right angle drives, spindles, live centers and 
gearboxes. For applications requiring a high degree of axial and 
radial rigidity, these bearings are suggested in preloaded duplex 
mountings.
MOUNTING
Although each 7000WN Product Family bearing is a self-contained 
unit, the construction is such that they are frequently mounted as two 
bearings opposed, so that thrust can be carried in either direction.
Unlike the radial type, the angular contact bearing, when mounted 
alone, requires adjustment and must be installed with care. As the 
bearing is relatively loose axially before mounting, it is important that 
the design incorporate some means to move the outer ring axially 
into its correct position relative to the inner ring. This adjustment 
should be made when the bearing is mounted. A common method is 
to place a preload spring or shims at one bearing location.
The correct adjustment of the single bearing is obtained 
when the initial axial looseness of the assembly is removed. This 
eliminates the possibility of premature bearing damage due to 
excessive preloading or looseness through improper adjustment.
Bearings designated “SU” are ground on both surfaces to 
permit universal mounting. These duplex sets are ideally suited 
for applications which involve a combination of radial loads from 
either direction. “SU” bearings are ﬂush ground so that under a 
speciﬁc axial gage load the inner ring will protrude beyond the face 
of the outer ring. This design results in an internal axial clearance 
within the bearing pair that helps to minimize build-up of excessive 
preload within the bearings when mounted on a shaft with maximum 
interference.
To assure correct mounting of bearings in the 7000WN Product 
Family, the word THRUST is marked on the thrust face of both the 
inner and outer rings. This face should abut against the housing 
shoulder or the end cover, depending on the required direction 
of "thrust".

LIGHT 7200WN SERIES
s  Dimensionally interchangeable with the radial 200 Series. 
s  7000WN Product Family includes a reﬁned bore diameter. 
s  A single bearing is suggested for applications in which the 
thrust load is in one direction or, in the case of combined 
loads, the thrust load is high in relation to the radial load. 
s  A duplex pair is suggested for applications where thrust is 
present in both directions or where axial displacement of the 
shaft must be restricted. 
s   For exceptionally high thrust loads in one direction, a tandem 
pair can be used, opposed by a third bearing. 
s  Sizes 7201K through 7203WN have a 20 degree contact angle 
and a nylon cage. 
s  Sizes 7204WN through 7218WN have a 40 degree contact 
angle and a one-piece, ball-piloted, pressed brass cage. 
s  Larger sizes 7219WN through 7230WN have a 40 degree 
contact angle and a one-piece, outer ring piloted high-
strength machined bronze cage.

MEDIUM 7300WN SERIES
s  Dimensionally interchangeable with the radial 300 Series. 
s  The 7000WN Product Family includes a reﬁned bore diameter. 
The 7300WN Series can sustain heavier thrust and combined 
loads than the 7200WN Series. 
s  A single bearing is suggested for applications in which the 
thrust load is in one direction or, in the case of combined 
loads, the thrust load is high in relation to the radial load. 
s  A duplex pair is suggested for applications where thrust is 
present in both directions or where axial displacement of the 
shaft must be restricted. 
s  For exceptionally high thrust loads in one direction, a tandem 
pair can be used, opposed by a third bearing. 
s  Size 7303W has a 20 degree contact angle and a steel cage. 
s  Sizes 7304WN through 7318WN have a 40 degree contact 
angle and a one-piece, ball-piloted, pressed brass cage. 
s  Larger sizes 7319WN through 7330WN have a 40 degree 
contact angle and a one-piece, outer ring piloted high-
strength machined bronze cage. 
s  Sizes 7306WN to 7318WN also available with a one-piece, 
high-strength, machined bronze retainer.

HEAVY 7400 SERIES
s  Dimensionally interchangeable with the radial 400 Series.
s   Sizes with a “WN” sufﬁx include a reﬁned bore diameter tolerance.
s  Can sustain heavier thrust and combined loads than the 
7300WN Series. 
s  A single bearing is suggested for applications in which the 
thrust load is in one direction or, in the case of combined loads,  
the thrust load is high in relation to the radial load. 
s   A duplex pair is suggested for applications where thrust is 
present in both directions or where axial displacement of the  
shaft must be restricted. 
s  For exceptionally high thrust loads in one direction, a 
tandem pair can be used, opposed by a third bearing. 
s  Sizes with a sufﬁx “W” have a 20 degree contact angle and 
a steel retainer. 
s   Sizes with a sufﬁx “PW” have a 35 degree contact angle and 
a steel retainer. 
s  Sizes with a “WN” sufﬁx have a 40 degree contact angle and a 
one-piece, high-strength machined bronze cage.

LIGHT 5200 SERIES
s  Features the same bores and outside diameters as the corresponding 
bearings in the 200 Series single-row radial type. 
s  Double-row angular contact ball bearings meet the demand for 
increased axial and radial rigidity in applications where the design 
limits space. 
s   Available in both Conrad and maximum capacity types. 
s   Sufﬁx “K” denotes Conrad (example: 5203K). 
s   Sufﬁx “W” or no sufﬁx denotes maximum capacity type (example: 
5212W, 5213). 
s  Please note: these double-row series bearings are not prelubricated.

s  Features the same bores and outside diameters as 
corresponding bearings in the 300 Series single-row radial type. 
s  Double-row angular contact ball bearings meet the demand for 
increased axial and radial rigidity in applications where design 
limits space.  
s  Available in Conrad and maximum capacity types. 
s  Sufﬁx “K” denotes Conrad type (example: 5303K). 
s  Sufﬁx “W” or no sufﬁx denotes maximum capacity type 
(examples: 5312W, 5319).
s  Please note that these double-row series bearings are not 
prelubricated.

PERFORMANCE
The performance of a super precision bearing is not completely 
deﬁned by the ABEC/ISO classes. The latitude of these classes 
allows for a signiﬁcant range of variability in product performance 
among bearing manufacturers. Characteristics such as raceway 
curvature and uniformity; the balls’ conformance to sphericity; 
race and ball surface ﬁnish; waviness of contact areas; preload 
offset tolerance; cleanliness; calibration of envelope dimensions; 
matching of bearings within a set; cage design and material; 
lubricant; radial play; contact angle and precision of ball 
complement are not deﬁned by ABEC/ISO. All have a direct impact 
on the service life and performance of a bearing. The lack of a 
comprehensive standard allows inferior bearings to be marketed 
as ABEC 7 or 9 (ISO P4 or P2) without the ability to produce superior 
performance. All Timken MM, MMV, and MMX precision grade 
comply with strict controls over these non-speciﬁed parameters, 
to provide premium performance. 
OPTIMIZED GRADES OF PRECISION
MM, MMV –  
SUPER PRECISION, SUPER HIGH PRECISION  
(ABEC 7/9, ISO P4/P2)
Super precision bearings manufactured to the MM(V) tolerance 
class operate with running accuracy and performance levels meet-
ing ABEC 9 (ISO P2) yet maintain non-critical features at ABEC 7 
(ISO P4) level for cost-effectiveness. Bore and O.D. surfaces are 
coded in micron units for the convenience of the discriminating 
machine tool builder striving for optimum ﬁtting of crucial spindle 
components.
MMX –  
ULTRAPRECISION (ABEC 9, ISO P2)
Super precision bearings with closer tolerances and running 
accuracies than ABEC 7 (ISO P4) bearings are made to ABEC 9 
(ISO P2) tolerances. Bearings produced to these tolerances are 
generally used on ultra-high-speed grinding spindles designed 
for tight dimensional tolerances and super-ﬁne surface ﬁnishes.

BEARING TYPES
ANGULAR-CONTACT BEARINGS
2MM-WI types with 15 degree initial contact angle are designed 
to meet the needs of machine builders for precision bearings which 
will operate at as low a temperature as possible for a wide range 
of speeds and operating loads. In order for machines to produce 
more accurate work at a higher production rate, the bearings must 
provide a high degree of rigidity in both axial and radial directions 
while operating at minimum temperatures. For example, precision 
machining or cutting tools impose heavier loads on bearings than 
those encountered in precision grinding. In the former, speeds are 
slower and loads heavier than the latter, where speeds are high 
and loads light. The 2MM-WI Type gives the machine builder the 
ﬂexibility required to meet such variations in applications.

3MM-WI manufactured with 25 degree contact angle, are for use on applications 
where the loading on the bearings is predominately thrust – and a high degree of axial 
rigidity is a deﬁnite requirement. Typical applications for these are large vertical rotary 
surface grinders, horizontal and vertical disc grinders, and thrust bearing applications 
for heavy-duty lathes where the bearings must directly carry extremely high tail stock 
or chucking pressure.
2MM-WO with 15 degree initial contact angle are designed for extremely high-
speed applications where centrifugal force of the balls is the principal load on the 
bearing. Unlike the MM-WI Type, which has a low shoulder outer ring, the 2MM-WO 
Type has full shoulders on both sides of the outer race and a low shoulder on one side 
of the inner ring. This design permits assembly with a maximum complement of balls 
and a one-piece cage which pilots against the precision-ground lands of the outer 
ring. Generally this bearing series is supplied with a separable inner ring and ball 
retaining cage along with special race geometry for extremely high-speed operation.
2MMV and 3MMV-HX are dimensionally interchangeable with equivalent 9100, 
99100, 9300 and ISO Series-10 and 19 bearings. These designs enable spindle heads 
to remove more material in less time while maintaining superior machining tolerances. 
This is achieved through a proven combination of unique ball complements with 
precision engineering raceway geometries. 
2MMV and 3MMV-HX VV possess all of the high-speed advantages of the HX 
but with true high speed seals. These bearing seals protect lubricant from outside 
contaminants while ensuring internal lubricant retention, extending service life 
signiﬁcantly. 
2MMV and 3MMV 99100WN are available with 15 degree or 25 degree contact angle 
variations and have been developed to operate under the demanding requirements of 
high-speed machine tools. They incorporate design features which permit operation at 
higher speeds than standard angular contact ball bearings. The bore, outside diameter 
and width are the same as the MM9100 Series. 
BALL SCREW SUPPORT BEARINGS
To meet the demands of the servo-controlled machinery ﬁeld, the Timken® Fafnir ® 
ball screw support bearings are specially designed with steep contact angles and offer 
high levels of stiffness for ball screw application requirements. Timken’s most recent 
product offering in this area is a series of double-row, sealed, ﬂanged (or cartridge)

INTRODUCTION
Workhead and tool spindles are the most important components 
of machine tools. Consequently, to reach the requirements for 
spindle speed, work accuracy and ﬁnish, selection of the proper 
size and type of ball bearings to support these spindles is a critical 
design problem.
Of all the anti-friction bearing types, super precision ball 
bearings have proved to be the best value for the wide variety of 
bearing applications covering broad ranges of operating loads, 
speeds and lubrication conditions. Duplexed, preloaded, angular 
contact bearings with one-piece composition retainers, have 
excellent capacity and provide maximum spindle rigidity.  These 
bearings are widely used in achieving faster speeds, greater 
accuracy, smoother ﬁnishes and higher production rates.
Many considerations are involved in the choice of bearings 
for precision applications. Among those which influence the 
performance of machine tool spindles are the internal ﬁt-up and 
geometry of the bearings, the mounting arrangement, the shaft and 
housing mounting ﬁts, the balance and alignment of the rotating 
parts, and last, but equally important, the lubrication.  While many 
of these factors are signiﬁcant in slow-speed applications, all of 
them must be considered for high-speed spindles.
To minimize deﬂection under load, shafts for machine tool 
spindles are designed to have a minimum unsupported length 
and maximum cross-section. For the same reason, spindle 
housings are designed heavy enough to carry the work load. 
Their cross-sections are made as uniform as possible to reduce 
stress concentration during uneven deﬂection of the frame due to 
thermal changes.  In addition, heavy, well-proportioned housings 
can function as sinks to conduct heat away from ball bearings. 
SELECTIVE ASSEMBLY
Under certain conditions it may be desirable to control ﬁts more 
accurately without the added expense of using closer tolerance 
bearings and assembly parts. This can be accomplished by 
selective assembly of the bearings, shafts, and housings, after 
they have been sized and sorted according to bores and outside 
diameters. Timken provides bore and O.D. micron coding as 
standard practice for super precision angular contact radial ball 
bearings. This improved ﬁt-up at assembly provides a higher degree 
of precision from the spindle. 
SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS
Detailed assembly drawings on the following pages are 
representative of successful applications of Timken® Fafnir® 
super precision bearings on such equipment; high-cycle wheel 
heads; high-speed internal grinding spindles; super precision 
work heads; and high-speed router spindles. It is hoped that these 
arrangements will stimulate questions regarding your particular 
application problems which will promptly be addressed by your 
Timken representative.
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
High-speed grease-lubricated spindles and heavy precision 
workheads requiring unusual rigidity and running accuracy are 
a few of the many special problems involving super precision 
bearings. These and many other applications generally require 
design features that can be reviewed by your Timken representative.

APPLICATIONS
HIGH-SPEED INTERNAL GRINDING SPINDLE
Designed for internal precision grinding, this spindle incorporates 
2MM9106WO-CR super precision bearings, preloaded by a nest of 
coiled helical springs mounted in a cartridge. Thrust load exerted 
by the springs assures intimate contact of the balls with the bearing 
raceways under all operating conditions. The sealed construction 
provides highly effective protection against intrusion of coolant and 
foreign matter. Grease, packed in each bearing prior to assembly, 
is sealed-in for life. Operating speed of this spindle is 25000 RPM.
ULTRA PRECISION SURFACE GRINDING SPINDLE
2MMX9122WI-DUM super precision bearings, produced to 
ABEC9 tolerances, are employed in this horizontal surface grinding 
spindle for maximum rigidity and accuracy. A back-to-back pair 
of 2MM312WI-CR-DUL super precision bearings is used at the 
ﬂoating location. This spindle grinds surfaces that are accurate 
within .000025 inch, ﬂat and parallel, are square within .000010 
inch, and to a surface ﬁnish of 5 rms, or better. The spindle, driven 
by a 30 hp motor, operates at 900 RPM. Bearings are packed with 
grease prior to assembly.
PRECISION SURFACE GRINDING SPINDLE
This motorized surface grinding spindle, operating at 3600 RPM, 
uses 2MM9107WI-DUM duplex super precision preloaded bearings 
at both locations, mounted back-to-back, with one pair ﬂoating. 
Labyrinth slinger-type sealing prevents entry of contaminants and 
seals in the lubrication. Bearings are grease lubricated for life.
HEAVY-DUTY PRECISION BORING SPINDLE
Super precision, duplexed, preloaded bearings mounted back-
to-back are used at each location in this boring spindle to assure 
smooth performance and a high degree of radial and axial rigidity. 
Operating speeds vary between 200 and 3000 RPM. Equal-length 
spacers between the bearings at the work end increase spindle 
rigidity. When the bearings are properly positioned on the shaft and 
the respective rings securely clamped, the preload is reproduced 
and no subsequent adjustment is required. Just prior to assembly, 
each bearing is packed with grease for life.
SIX-SPINDLE AUTOMATIC SCREW MACHINE
This bearing arrangement meets the demand for a high-speed, 
heavy-duty, multiple-spindle screw machine to operate with 
constant accuracy at maximum production. Because of the hollow 
shaft construction and the short distance between bearings, extra-
light series duplex pairs are used at each location. This affords a 
high degree of radial rigidity and adds stiffness to the shaft. By 
mounting a duplex pair of ﬂanged (3MMF) bearings with a 2MM 
super precision bearing, back-to-back, under a predetermined 
preload at the front end, accuracy and rigidity of the spindle 
are assured and permit a straight housing bore. The rear pair of 
back-to-back bearings is allowed to ﬂoat in the housing, making 
an outer-ring spacer unnecessary. Lubrication is by pressure-feed 
oil circulation.

HIGH-SPEED PRECISION BORING HEAD
This high-speed boring head operates at 2500 to 3000 RPM, 
employing angular-contact, super precision bearings. The front 
bearings are of different sizes. The outer ring of the larger bearing 
abuts and is clamped against the housing shoulder. The inboard 
bearing is permitted to move axially in its housing under spring 
load. At the rear location two bearings, of the same size and 
spring loaded, are allowed to ﬂoat in the housing as temperature 
differentials occur in the operation spindle. With this head, 
interference shafts may be permitted without affecting bearing 
preload. Excessive heat generation is prevented, resulting in low 
operating temperatures. Bearings are grease lubricated.
ULTRA PRECISION GRINDING WORKHEAD
This workhead must maintain straightness and roundness 
accuracy within ten millionths (.000010) of an inch. To meet such 
rigid requirements for extremely close dimensional control, ultra 
precision ball bearings and a shaft of extra stiffness are used. The 
bearings for such applications are manufactured to tolerances 
closer than those for ABEC 9 (ISO P2) speciﬁcations. Equally 
important is the high degree of workmanship and accuracy with 
which the shaft, housing and component parts of the workhead 
must be made. Upper section shows a four-bearing arrangement 
for heavy work. Lower half shows a two-bearing mounting for 
lighter work. In either case, the bearings are packed with grease, 
prior to mounting.
PRECISION TOOLROOM SURFACE GRINDER SPINDLE
Timken®  Fafnir® duplexed, super precision, preloaded bearings 
used in this spindle provide the high degree of rigidity in both 
directions necessary to meet requirements for modern surface 
grinding and to assure efﬁcient performance at a low operating 
temperature. The housing is bored straight-through to assure true 
alignment – the housing shoulders are eliminated. The precision 
ground outer sleeve is doweled to the housing to provide the means 
for stabilizing the spindle axially at the work end bearing location. 
The rear pair of bearings ﬂoats to compensate for thermal changes. 
Bearings are grease lubricated for life just prior to assembly.
SINGLE BAR MACHINE
This spindle is supported by two pairs of 2MM9124WI-DUM 
super precison bearings, mounted back-to-back in tandem pairs. 
Operating speeds vary from 78 to 1500 RPM. A pair of 2MM9122WI-
DUM bearings mounted in tandem carries a 25000 pound thrust 
load during the unchucking operation. The bearings are grease 
packed for life prior to assembly.
100,000 RPM HIGH-CYCLE WHEELHEAD
Super precision 2MMX9101WO-CR bearings produced to ABEC 
9 (ISO P2) RPM tolerances are spring-loaded in this wheelhead 
which operates at 100,000 RPM. Oil mist lubrication is employed 
and the motor is water cooled.

millionths (.000035) of an inch. Maximum operating speed is 4800 
RPM. Tandem pair of 3MM9114WI-DUL bearings is opposed by a 
spring-loaded 3MM9113WI bearing, resulting in excellent spindle 
rigidity. Bearings are prelubricated with grease.
HIGH-SPEED MOTORIZED ROUTER
A specially matched duplex pair of Timken® Fafnir® 2MM210WI-
DU-FS223 super precision ball bearings, mounted back-to-back 
at the work end, affords the necessary bearing rigidity to permit 
routing through aluminum plate one inch thick with a single pass. 
The upper bearing is spring-loaded and permitted to ﬂoat. Router 
is driven by a 30 hp motor at speeds up to 15000 RPM, and uses 
oil mist lubrication.
PRECISION VERTICAL MILLING SPINDLE
This spindle operates at 12 different speeds ranging from 260 to 
6200 rpm under a wide variety of conditions. At the work end, two 
duplex pairs of Timken Fafnir 2MM212WI-DUL preloaded bearings 
are mounted in tandem in a back-to-back arrangement, separated 
by spacers of equal length. This affords extremely high radial and 
axial rigidity. At the center, a pair of Timken Fafnir 2MM210WI-DUL 
bearings mounted back-to-back permits axial ﬂoat of the spindle 
to compensate for thermal changes.
The driving pulley shaft is rigidly supported by a widely spaced 
duplex pair of Timken Fafnir 2MM212WI-DUL preloaded bearings. 
All bearings are grease packed for life.

STANDARD AND HEAVY-DUTY BEARINGS
t Designed and developed to give the machine manufacturer  
a ready-made unit providing excellent stiffness and accuracy  
in ball screw applications.
t Units combine the features of MM-BS-DU (Duplex) ball screw 
bearings with an accurately manufactured housing and  
laminar ring seals.
t Each unit is prepacked with a measured quantity of high  
quality bearing grease and requires no further lubrication.
t Units are supplied with the bearings in pairs mounted in the 
“DB” (“O”) arrangement.
t Other bearing arrangements can be accommodated if required. 
Please consult your Timken representative with details of your 
requirements or for suggested shaft and housing ﬁts.

EX-CELL-O SPINDLE BEARINGS
t “EX” Series (Timken® Fafnir® WI construction) designed to 
meet Ex-Cell-O replacement requirements for inch nominal 
spindles with bore and O.D. tolerances nominal to plus.
t “XWO” Series (Timken Fafnir WO separable construction) 
designed to meet Ex-Cell-O replacement requirements for 
inch nominal spindles with bore and O.D. tolerances nominal 
to minus. 
t Measurement of shafts and  housings (or reconditioning of 
parts) should determine replacement bearing style.
t Shafts and housings should be checked (and reworked) to 
avoid improper shaft and housing ﬁts.
t Preload selection should be based on operating speed and 
lubrication system of spindle.
