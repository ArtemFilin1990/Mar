For many years, INA has made a decisive contribution to the 
development and current level of rolling bearing technology, particularly 
through its compact needle roller bearings, high load capacity 
cylindrical roller bearings and its diverse range of track rollers for rotary 
and linear motion.
INA slewing rings are also known worldwide as premium products in 
the field of rolling bearing technology. These machine elements have 
proved themselves many times over; they have high load carrying 
capacity, a versatile range of applications and are highly cost-effective. 
Due to their design, a single bearing can reliably support radial, 
axial and tilting moment loads. It is therefore possible in many cases 
to replace bearing arrangements comprising a combination of radial 
and axial bearings by a single bearing. This reduces, in some cases 
considerably, the costs and work required in the design of the adjacent 
construction and the fitting of bearings.
Slewing rings are sealed on both sides, lubricated with a high quality 
grease, can be relubricated via lubrication nipples and are particularly 
easy to fit. The bearing rings are supplied without gear teeth or, 
in order to achieve simple drive solutions, are available with external 
or internal gear teeth.
INA slewing rings are designed as:
■four point contact bearings
– these slewing rings without preload are robust and proven 
under very demanding operation; they place only slight demands 
on the flatness and perpendicularity of the adjacent construction
– they are suitable for applications with low requirements for 
accuracy and rigidity of the bearing arrangement, for example in 
simple metalworking machines, wind power equipment and 
construction machinery
■crossed roller bearings
– these preloaded slewing rings can support higher loads than 
four point contact bearings. They have proved themselves 
particularly where bearings are subjected to high radial forces 
and moderate axial and tilting moment loads
– they are suitable for applications with uniform running free from 
stick-slip, low rotational resistance and high requirements for axial 
and radial runout accuracy and rigidity, for example in robots, 
handling systems and machine tools.
Catalogue 404 presented here gives comprehensive information 
on the reorganised standard range of these slewing rings. 
The catalogue has been completely revised and replaces 
Catalogue 403. Any information in editions that does not concur 
with the information is this edition is therefore invalid.

Load carrying capacity and life
Static load carrying capacity
The size of the slewing ring required is dependent on the 
demands made on its:
■static and dynamic load carrying capacity 
(Dynamic load carrying capacity see page 16)
■life (see Dynamic load carrying capacity and life, page 16)
■operational reliability.
Definition of static load carrying capacity
Slewing rings that undergo rotary motion only infrequently, 
undergo slow swivel motion, rotate only slowly or are subjected 
to load while stationary are dimensioned on the basis of their 
static load carrying capacity since the permissible load in these 
cases is determined not by material fatigue but by the load-
induced deformations at the contact points between the rolling 
elements and raceways.
The static load carrying capacity is described by:
■the basic static load ratings C0 (see dimension tables)
■the static limiting load diagrams Raceway and Fixing screws 
(see dimension tables and calculation example, page 15).
The size of a statically loaded slewing ring for a particular 
application can therefore be checked in approximate terms 
using the basic static load ratings C0 and the static limiting load 
diagrams Raceway.
Checking the static load carrying capacity
The static load carrying capacity can be checked in 
approximate terms only when:
■the load arrangement is in accordance with Figure 3 
(page 15)
■all the requirements stated in this publication are fulfilled in 
relation to
– flange rings and location
– fitting, lubrication and sealing. 
Where load arrangements are more complex or the 
conditions are not fulfilled, please consult INA.
In order to check the static load carrying capacity, the following 
equivalent static operating values must be determined:
■the equivalent static bearing load F0q
■the equivalent static tilting moment load M0q.
Checking is possible for applications with or without radial load.

Determining the equivalent static bearing load with radial 
load and checking the static load carrying capacity in the 
static limiting load diagram Raceway
Radial loads can only be taken into consideration if the 
radial load F0r is smaller than the basic static radial load 
rating C0 according to the dimension table.
■Calculate the load eccentricity parameter  using the 
formula.
■Determine the static radial load factor f0r.
This should be done as follows:
– determine the ratio F0r/F0a in Figure 1 or Figure 2
– from the ratio F0r/F0a and , determine the static radial 
load factor f0r from Figure 1 or Figure 2.
■Determine the application factor fA according to Table 1, 
page 14 and the safety factor fS if required.
■Calculate the equivalent axial bearing load F0q and the 
equivalent tilting moment load M0q using the formulae.
■Using the values for F0q and M0q, determine the load 
point in the static limiting load diagram Raceway 
(see calculation example, page 15).
The load point must be below the raceway curve.

Application factors
The application factors fA in Table 1 are empirical values. 
They take account of the most important requirements – e.g. 
the type and severity of operation, rigidity or running accuracy.
If the precise requirements of an application are known, 
the values may be altered accordingly.
Application factors  1 must not be used.
A large proportion of applications can be statically 
calculated using an application factor of 1 – e.g. bearings 
for gearboxes and rotary tables.
Safety factors
The factor for additional safety is fS  = 1.
It is not normally necessary to factor in any additional safety in 
calculation.
In special cases, for example approval specifications, 
internal specifications, requirements stipulated by 
inspection bodies etc., the appropriate safety factor 
should be used.

Calculation example
The four point contact bearing VSI 20 0744 N with internal 
gear teeth (see dimension table, page 60) for application 
in a crane is to be checked in relation to its static load carrying 
capacity.
Given
Required
Static load carrying capacity of the bearing.
Solution
Determining the load point in the static limiting load diagram 
– checking the static load carrying capacity
Using the values for F0q and M0q, the load point in the static 
limiting load diagrams Raceway and Fixing screws is 
determined (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).
The load point is below the raceway and screw curves. 
The four point contact bearing VSI 20 0744 N is adequately 
dimensioned and therefore suitable for the application.

Load carrying capacity and life
Dynamic load carrying capacity
Dynamically loaded slewing rings – i.e. bearings undergoing 
predominantly rotary motion – are dimensioned in accordance 
with their dynamic load carrying capacity.
Definition of dynamic load carrying capacity
The dynamic load carrying capacity is determined by the fatigue 
behaviour of the material. The life as a fatigue period depends 
on the load and operating speed of the bearing and the 
statistical probability of the first occurrence of failure.
The dynamic load carrying capacity is described by:
■the basic dynamic load ratings C (see dimension tables)
■the basic (calculated) rating life L or Lh.
The size of a dynamically loaded slewing ring for a particular 
application can therefore be checked in approximate terms 
using the basic dynamic load ratings and the basis rating life.
Definition of basic rating life
The basis for calculation is the theory of probability, according 
to which a defined percentage of a sufficiently large group 
of apparently identical bearings achieves or exceeds a 
particular number of revolutions before the first evidence of 
material fatigue appears. Calculation is based on a requisite 
reliability of 90%.
The basic rating life is only an approximate value for 
guidance and comparative purposes. 
Calculation of an adjusted rating life in accordance 
with ISO 281 is recommended if the nominal viscosity of 
the lubricant is not achieved for the specific operating 
load case (Nominal viscosity see page 33).
Determining the basic rating life
The life formulae for L and Lh are only valid:
■with a load arrangement in accordance with Figure 5
■if all the requirements stated in this catalogue are fulfilled in 
relation to
– flange rings and location
– fitting, lubrication and sealing
■if the load and speed can be regarded as constant during 
operation
– if the load and speed are not constant, equivalent 
operating values can be determined that will cause 
the same fatigue conditions as the actual loads 
(see Equivalent operating values, INA Catalogue 307).
■if the load ratio is Fr/Fa  8.
If more complex load arrangements are present, a ratio 
Fr/Fa  8 or if the conditions differ from those stated, 
please consult INA.
Determining the basic rating life for bearings subjected to 
combined loads
For bearings subjected to combined loads – bearings 
with axial, radial and tilting moment loads – the life L and Lh 
is calculated as follows:
■calculate the load eccentricity parameter  using the formula
■determine the ratio of the dynamic radial bearing load Fr to 
the dynamic axial bearing load Fa (Fr/Fa)
■using the values for  and the ratio Fr/Fa in Figure 5 or 
Figure 6, determine the dynamic load factor kF
■calculate the equivalent dynamic axial bearing load Paxial 
using the formula
■enter the equivalent dynamic axial bearing load Paxial and 
the basic dynamic axial load rating Ca in the life formulae 
for L or Lh and calculate the life. If swivel operation is 
present, enter the operating speed n calculated using the 
formula in the life formula Lh.
Determining the basic rating life for bearings subjected to 
radial loads only
For slewing rings subjected to radial loads only, the following 
values are entered in the life formulae for L and Lh:
■instead of the equivalent dynamic axial bearing load Paxial, 
the equivalent dynamic radial bearing load Pradial (i.e. Fr)
– Pradial = Fr
– the basic dynamic radial load rating Cr.

Load carrying capacity and life
Influences on the operating life of slewing rings
The operating life is defined as the life actually achieved by a 
slewing ring. This can deviate significantly from the calculated 
basic rating life due to wear and/or fatigue.
Possible causes include:
■oscillating bearing motion with very small swivel angles – 
false brinelling
■vibration while the bearing is stationary
■unsuitable design or deformation of the adjacent 
construction
■excessively high operating temperatures
■incorrect maintenance or lubrication
■contamination
■incorrect fitting
■preload of the fixing screws.
Due to the variety of installation and operating conditions, 
it is not possible to precisely predetermine the operating life. 
The most reliable way of arriving at a close estimate is by 
comparison with similar applications.

Fixing screws
Static and dynamic load carrying capacity
In addition to the raceway, the load carrying capacity of the 
fixing screws must also be checked. This is based on the 
information in the section Static load carrying capacity 
(page 12).
Conditions for checking load carrying capacity
The load carrying capacity of the fixing screws can be checked 
if the following conditions are fulfilled:
■the criteria in the section Static load carrying capacity are 
fulfilled
■the bearing load is supported; i.e. the bearing is installed 
such that the axial load relieves the screws
– if the load is suspended, the screws are subjected to 
tensile forces by the axial load and must be of larger 
dimensions. In such applications, please consult INA
■the screws are tightened as specified using a torque wrench
– screw tightening factor A = 1,6, 
tightening torques according to Table 3, page 46
■the permissible contact pressure (page 36 and page 42) 
is not exceeded.
If the actual conditions vary from those stated or if more 
complex load arrangements are present, please consult INA.
Indicator of load carrying capacity
The load carrying capacity of the screws is described by:
■the curves in the static limiting load diagrams Fixing screws 
(Figure 1 and dimension tables)
■the maximum permissible radial load Fr perm (friction locking) 
in the dimension tables.
Static limiting load diagrams
The screw curves are given in the static limiting load diagrams 
Fixing screws (see example in Figure 1) – the required safety 
factors have been included. The curves are based on screws 
of grade 10.9, tightened to 90% of their proof stress including 
the torsion content.
If screws of grade 8.8 or 12.9 are used, the equivalent 
static loads F0q and M0q (see Static load carrying capacity, 
page 12 and page 13) must be converted using the following 
factors:
■Grade 8.8
– F0q1,65, M0q1,65
■Grade 12.9
– F0q0,8, M0q0,8.

Static load carrying capacity of fixing screws
The static load carrying capacity of the screw is limited by its 
proof stress.
Checking the static load carrying capacity without radial load
■From the equivalent static load F0q and M0q 
(see Static load carrying capacity, page 12 or page 13), 
determine the load point in the static limiting load diagram 
Fixing screws (see example in Figure 1).
The load point must be below the appropriate screw 
curve (see example in Figure 1).
Checking the static load carrying capacity with radial load
The screw connections must prevent displacement of the 
bearing rings in relation to the adjacent construction.
In addition to the initial checking, the following check 
must also be carried out with radial load:
■the maximum external radial load multiplied by the 
application factor fA is compared with the maximum 
permissible radial load Fr perm in the dimension tables
– the values are valid for screws of grade 10.9.
Factoring in the radial load gives guide values only. 
For high radial loads (Fr/Fa  4), please consult INA.
Dynamic load carrying capacity of fixing screws
The dynamic load carrying capacity is the load that can be 
supported “permanently” by the screws. This corresponds to 
the fatigue strength of the screw.
Checking the dynamic load carrying capacity
■From the dynamic loads present, determine the equivalent 
loads F0q and M0q in accordance with the section 
Load carrying capacity and life, page 12 or page 13
– instead of the application factor, the operating load must 
be increased by a factor according to Table 1
■Check the load carrying capacity in the static limiting load 
diagram Fixing screws
– the load point must be below the appropriate screw curve 
(see example in Figure 1).

Rotational resistance
The rotational resistance of slewing rings is essentially 
determined by:
■the rolling resistance of the rolling elements
■the internal clearance or bearing preload
■the friction of the spacers or the cage or cage segments
■the seals.
The rotational resistance is also influenced by a large number 
of other parameters.
These include:
■the preload and lubrication of the seals
■the quantity of grease in the bearing
■the manufacturing tolerances
■the change in the internal clearance due to fitting
■the deformation of the adjacent construction.
Calculation of the rotational resistance
The rotational resistance torque MW can only be calculated in 
approximate terms using the influences stated.
The factors required for calculation are given in Table 1.

The values determined using the formula may differ 
considerably from the actual values due to the influence 
of the aforementioned factors, e.g.:
■in the case of bearings subjected to low load or zero load
■due to the flatness and perpendicularity deviation of the 
adjacent construction
■for a ratio 
.
If the rotational resistance for the specific application is 
considerably less than the value calculated using the formula, 
please consult INA.
If four point contact bearings of series VL 20 or VS 20 are 
used for spool bearing arrangements, large fluctuations 
in rotational resistance must be anticipated due to the 
nature of the application.
Dimensioning of rotary drives
For the dimensioning of rotary drives, account must be taken 
not only of the rotational resistance of the bearing but also:
■the acceleration power
■any tilted positioning of the machines
■any wind forces acting on the bearing arrangement.
If precise values are not available, the value of MW used should 
be doubled.

Gear teeth
INA slewing rings are available in the following designs:
■with external gear teeth (A)
■with internal gear teeth (I)
■without gear teeth (U).
The letters A, I, U indicate the type of gear teeth – 
for the composition of the designation, see the section 
Ordering example and ordering designation, page 8.
Design and quality of gear teeth
As standard, the gear teeth on slewing rings are involute gear 
teeth without addendum modification (0 = 20°).
The gear teeth are of quality 12e28 or 12e29 and, in the case 
of the standard series XS 14, 10e27, in accordance with 
DIN 3 960, DIN 3 962-1 and DIN 3 967. Deviations are 
indicated in the dimension tables.
The runout of the gear teeth deviates from DIN 3 962 and is 
defined as the variation in wall thickness between the rolling 
element pitch circle diameter and the pitch circle diameter of 
the gear teeth (see Accuracy, page 50 and page 80).
The bottom clearance is 0,25modulus and the minimum 
dedendum is 1,25modulus (reference profile to DIN 867).
In order to prevent meshing interference, the tip on external 
gear teeth is reduced. This allows the use of pinions with a small 
number of teeth (at least 14 teeth).
Four point contact bearings VA and crossed roller bearings XA 
are designed in some cases without a tip reduction 
(see dimension tables).
Material and heat treatment
The heat treatment of the gear teeth is characterised by means 
of suffixes:
■normalised (N)
– standard design of gear rings
■quenched and tempered (V)
– special design of gear rings
■hardened (H)
– special design of gear rings.
Example:
VLA 20 0414 N.
Four point contact bearing, light series 20, normalised 
gear teeth.
For the composition of the suffix, see the section 
Ordering designation, page 8.
Standard design of gear teeth
Slewing rings with gear rings made from normalised material 
C45N or 42CrMo4V65 (suffix N) have proved themselves in a 
wide range of applications.
The permissible tooth forces for each bearing are indicated in 
the dimension tables.
Special designs of gear teeth
If the permissible tooth forces indicated in the dimension tables 
are exceeded as a result of high circumferential forces, the 
gear teeth may be quenched and tempered. This increases 
the permissible tooth force by approximately 20%. The notch 
impact toughness in the low temperature range is also 
improved.
The gear ring material for the quenched and tempered design 
is 42CrMo4V, suffix V.
If there are particularly high requirements for the life of the 
gear teeth, the contour of the gear teeth can be hardened. 
The flanks and root of the teeth are hardened simultaneously.
These slewing rings are indicated by the suffix H.
The special designs “V” and “H” are only available by agreement 
for large quantities.
Further information on special designs is given in the 
dimension tables.
Tooth forces
The tooth forces Fz in the dimension tables have the following 
definitions:
The values are applicable to:
■hardened and ground drive pinions
■tooth quality of the drive pinion 7b26
■driving pinion
– with a driving wheel, the permissible value is 90% of the 
Fz value
■suspended pinion bearing arrangement
■swivelling operation
– the maximum swivel speed is 1,5 m/s.
For other shock factors (see Table 1), the tooth forces indicated 
in the dimension tables can be converted on a linear basis.
Fz norm = permissible tooth force
(tooth base fatigue strength at a shock factor of 1,2).
Fz max = maximum permissible tooth force
(tooth base fracture strength at a shock factor 
of 1,35).

---

25
A selection of the usual shock factors for gear teeth is given in 
Table 1 – for other operating conditions, please consult INA.
The shock factors are guide values for conversion of the tooth 
forces Fz norm and Fz max.
Drive pinion
If no particular transmission ratio is required, the following 
pinions in a hardened and ground design are suitable:
■pinions with 17 teeth without addendum modification
■pinions with 14 teeth and an addendum modification factor 
of x = +0,5.
A tip reduction of 0,1modulus is recommended.
The gear tooth width of the pinion should project beyond the 
tooth width of the slewing ring on both sides by at least 
0,5modulus.
In order to minimise the wear rate at low circumferential 
speeds (v  0,1 m/s), a quenched and tempered pinion of 
tooth quality 9b27 should be used. The permissible load 
carrying capacity of the gear pair is normally restricted by 
the load carrying capacity of the pinion.
The bearing arrangement of the drive pinion must be designed 
such that the pinion deflection under load is as small as 
possible.
Individual values for the gear pair can be calculated on request.
Tooth flank backlash
On toothed bearing rings, there is a green mark on the tooth tip 
at the point with the largest ring width (the largest distance 
between the rolling element pitch circle diameter DM and the 
pitch circle diameter of the gear teeth). During fitting, the 
required tooth flank backlash (0,03 to 0,04modulus) must be 
set here – see Fitting, page 44.
Binding during operation can be prevented by the correctly 
adjusted tooth flank backlash.
The flank backlash can, for example, be eliminated by a drive 
pinion preloaded by a spring. It must be ensured, however, 
that sufficient bottom clearance is maintained.
Appropriate information is given in the technical literature.

Lubrication
Correct lubrication and regular maintenance are important 
preconditions for achieving a long operating life with slewing 
rings.
The lubricant serves to:
■form a lubricant film capable of supporting loads on all 
contact surfaces
■seal the bearing against external influences (in the case 
of grease lubrication) and thus prevent the ingress of solid 
and liquid contaminants
■reduce the running noise
■protect the bearing against corrosion
■dissipate heat from rolling bearing subjected to heavy loads 
(in the case of oil lubrication).
Type of lubrication
Slewing rings can be lubricated with grease or oil.
The decisive factors in determining the appropriate type 
of lubrication and quantity of lubricant required are:
■the design and size of the bearing
■the design of the bearing environment
■the lubricant feed
■the operating conditions.
Lubrication of the gear teeth
The points stated above apply to the gear teeth of slewing 
rings.
The lubricant used should have good adhesion.
Suitable lubricants are given in Table 3, page 32.

Lubrication
Grease lubrication
Criteria for grease selection
Operating temperature range (Figure 1)
The range must correspond to the potential range of 
temperatures in the rolling bearing.
The possible operating temperatures should not exceed 
the upper and lower limit values:
■the maximum operating temperature should be +20 °C 
less than the upper limit value
■the minimum operating temperature should be +20 °C 
above the lower limit value. At very low temperatures, 
greases release very little base oil. This can result in 
inadequate lubrication. 
Type of grease (Figure 2)
The characteristics of a grease depend on:
■the base oil
■the viscosity of the base oil
– important for the speed range
■the thickener
– the shear strength is important for the speed range
■the additives.
Consistency of greases (Figure 3)
Greases are divided into consistency classes – known as NLGI 
grades (DIN 51818). Grades 1, 2 and 3 are preferred for 
rolling bearings.
The greases should not become:
■too soft at high temperatures (NLGI 1)
■too stiff at low temperatures (NLGI 3).
Greases should be selected by their speed parameter 
n · dM:
– greases with a low speed parameter should be used 
for bearings running at low speeds.
The consistency of polycarbamide greases can be altered 
by shear stresses.

Grease lubrication
Behaviour in the presence of water (Figure 4)
Water in the grease has a highly detrimental effect on the 
operating life of the bearing:
■the behaviour of greases in the presence of water is 
assessed according to DIN 51807 (see Table 1)
■the anti-corrosion characteristics can be checked in 
accordance with DIN 51802 – information is given in the 
grease manufacturer’s data sheets.
Pressure properties
■The viscosity must be sufficiently high at the operating 
temperature for the formation of a lubricant film capable of 
supporting loads
■At high loads, greases with EP (extreme pressure) 
characteristics and high base oil viscosity should be used 
(KP grease to DIN 51502)
■Silicone greases should only be used with low loads 
(P  3% C).
The load-supporting capability of common greases can 
change if EP additives containing lead are not used.
Therefore:
– check the grease selection
– consult the lubricant manufacturer.

Miscibility
The preconditions for miscibility are as follows:
■same base oil
■compatible thickener types
■similar base oil viscosities
– the difference must not be more than one ISO VG class
■same consistency – NLGI grade.
If greases are to be mixed with each other, contact the 
grease manufacturer.
Storage (Figure 5)
Lubricants age due to environmental influences. 
The information provided by the lubricant manufacturer 
should be adhered to.
INA uses greases with a mineral oil base. Experience shows 
that these greases can be stored for up to 3 years.
The preconditions for storage are:
■closed room or store
■temperatures between 0 °C and +40 °C
■relative atmospheric humidity not more than 65%
■no contact with chemical agents (vapours, gases or fluids)
■rolling bearings sealed.
The start-up frictional torque of greased bearings may 
temporarily be higher than normal after extended periods of 
storage. The lubricity of the grease may also have deteriorated.
Greases – even those obtained from the same 
manufacturer – may vary in their characteristics. 
Therefore, INA does not accept any liability for lubricants 
and their behaviour during operation.

Lubrication
Grease lubrication
Initial greasing
INA crossed roller bearings are supplied greased (for the grease 
used, see Table 1, page 28). The grease is a high quality 
lithium complex soap grease with a mineral oil base in 
accordance with DIN 51825–KP2N–20 and is suitable for 
temperatures from –25 °C to +150 °C
The total grease quantity can be calculated in approximate 
terms using the following formulae. Calculation gives a grease 
quantity that approximately fills the available free space in 
the raceway system of the bearing.

Lubrication intervals
The lubrication intervals are essentially dependent on:
■the operating conditions
■the environmental influences such as contamination, 
water, etc.
■the type of slewing ring.
The lubrication intervals can only be determined by 
means of tests under the specific application conditions:
– sufficiently long observation periods must be allowed
– the condition of the grease must be checked at regular 
intervals.
If comparable results are not available, guide values for the 
lubrication interval are given in Table 2.
The values are based on the following conditions:
■operating temperature  +70 °C
■circumferential speed  0,5 m/s
■low to moderate load.
1) For other operating conditions, please consult INA.
2) For the gear teeth, the guide values should be taken as half the 
stated values.
Slewing rings – the raceway and gear teeth – must always 
be relubricated:
– after any cleaning, e.g. after spraying with water, 
steam etc.
– before and after extended periods of stoppage, 
e.g. for cranes and construction machinery during 
the winter months
– in conditions of high humidity.

Grease operating life
If relubrication is not possible, the grease operating life 
becomes the decisive factor.
Based on experience, the guide value for the grease operating 
life in the majority of applications is higher than the guide 
value for the relubrication interval by a factor of 2.
At operating temperatures above +70 ºC, the lubrication 
interval and therefore the grease operating life are 
reduced.
In order to ensure operational reliability, the grease 
operating life should not exceed 3 years.
Relubrication procedure
Table 3, page 32, shows suitable lubricants for the raceway and 
gear teeth. 
If slewing rings operate under high to very high load and at low 
to very low speeds, lubricants with base oils up to ISO VG 1500 
can be used in order to improve the lubricant film, depending 
on the operating temperature. In such applications, please 
consult INA. 
The maintenance of bearings is described in detail in 
INA Technical Product Information TPI 13. This TPI is available 
upon request from INA.
Raceway
During the lubrication procedure, foreign matter such as 
contaminants, dust, spray water and condensation that have 
entered the slewing ring are pressed out.
If possible, the grease used for relubrication should be the same 
as that used in initial operation.
Lubrication should always be carried out on bearings that are 
warm from operation:
■clean the lubrication nipples.
■grease should then be pressed into the lubrication nipples 
until a collar of fresh grease forms around both seals 
(one bearing ring should slowly rotated during this process)
– the old grease must be allowed to flow out unhindered.
Before initial operation, it must be ensured that all the 
lubricant ducts to the bearing are filled with lubricant.
Gear teeth
If possible, the grease used should be the same as that used in 
initial operation.
■The gear teeth, especially the tooth root surface, must be 
cleaned.
■The gear teeth must be sprayed or brushed with grease.

Lubrication
Grease lubrication
Lubrication using lubrication cartridges
Lubrication cartridges allow continuous relubrication of slewing 
rings up to 24 months. They are an independent greasing 
system and are thus also suitable for retrofitting.
The cartridges are filled with grease and located directly on the 
bearing or on the adjacent construction.
If the lubrication cartridges are applied to the adjacent 
construction, the grease is fed to the bearing via lubricant 
pipes.
Information on the use and handling of lubrication cartridges 
can be obtained from the relevant manufacturers.
1) The temperature ranges stated are valid for the lubricants used on the raceway system.

Lubrication
Oil lubrication
For oil lubrication, INA recommends oils of type CL/CLP to 
DIN 51 517 or HL/HLP to DIN 51 524 (ISO VG 10 to 100).
The oils can be used at operating temperatures from –30 ºC to 
+100 ºC.
Note the limiting speeds for nG grease and nG oil according 
to the dimension tables.
Selection of the oil
A lubricant film capable of supporting loads is required at the 
contact points between the rolling elements and the raceway.
Depending on the operating speed, at the operating 
temperature the oil must have:
■at least the nominal viscosity 1 (Figure 6).
Nominal viscosity for mineral oils
The guide value for 1 is dependent on:
■the mean bearing diameter dM
■the speed n.
It takes account of the EHD theory of lubricant film formation 
and practical experience.
Determining the nominal viscosity 1 according to the 
example (Figure 6):
■assign 1 to an ISO VG nominal viscosity grade between 
10 and 1500
– mean viscosity to DIN 51 519
■intermediate values should be rounded to the nearest 
ISO VG grade
– this is due to the steps between the viscosity groups.
This method cannot be used for synthetic oils
– these have different speed/pressure and
speed/temperature characteristics.
Influence of temperature on viscosity
As the temperature increases, the viscosity of the oil decreases.
When selecting the viscosity, the lowest operating 
temperature should be taken into consideration:
– increasing viscosity reduces the flowability of the oil and 
leads to increased power losses.

Sealing of the bearing arrangement
INA seal profiles
INA slewing rings are supplied sealed.
Depending on the requirement and type of contamination – 
e.g. heavy contamination, high humidity, spray or flood water 
etc.– additional sealing of the bearing position in the adjacent 
construction may be necessary.
INA seal profiles
For sealing of the bearing arrangement in the adjacent 
construction, INA supplies various seal profiles by the metre. 
These profiles fulfil a wide variety of requirements (see Table 1). 
Installation drawings can be requested for the individual seal 
profiles.
The seal profiles are not suitable for applications 
requiring leakproof operation – or for grease lubrication. 
If leakage losses are unacceptable, measures such as 
rotary shaft seals can be applied.
Seal profile materials
The standard material for the profiles is the synthetic elastomer 
NBR 70. This material is characterised by:
■good resistance to oils and greases
■good wear resistance.
Operating temperature
INA seal profiles can be used at temperatures from –40 °C to 
+80 °C.
For temperatures lower or higher than this range, extreme 
environmental influences (e.g. ozone) or high speeds, 
please consult INA.
Fitting of seal profiles
The area around the bearing seal must be designed such 
that the seal profiles are not damaged during operation. 
Ensure that the profiles are not damaged while fitting 
the slewing ring.
Fit the profiles according to the following procedure:
■clean the area where the seal is to be fitted.
■press the seal profile carefully into the fitting space leaving an 
excess length of approximately 5%
– e.g. with a blunt wooden wedge (Figure 2).
■cut the profile to the exact length (Figure 2) – 
ensure that the joint faces are even.
■join the grease-free joint faces using a cyanacrylate adhesive 
without displacement (Figure 3) – e.g. using Loctite 406.
■complete the fitting of the profile (Figure 3).

Design of bearing arrangements
INA slewing rings can, as a single bearing position (Figure 1), 
transmit:
■axial loads from both directions
■radial loads
■tilting moment loads.
In order that these advantages can be utilised 
comprehensively, the adjacent construction must be of an 
appropriate design.
Bearing rings must always be rigidly and uniformly 
supported around their entire circumference and width.
The adjacent construction must be designed only in 
accordance with the information in this section. 
Any deviations from the specifications, material strength 
and adjacent components will considerably reduce 
the load carrying capacity and operating life of the 
slewing rings.
Sealing of the bearing position
If the bearing arrangement is sealed by means of a seal 
in the adjacent construction, observe the design guidelines 
for seal profiles in the section Sealing, page 34.
The area around the bearing seal must be designed such 
that the seal profiles are not damaged during operation.
Fixing screws
Screws of grade 10.9 are suitable for fixing the bearing rings 
or clamping rings (see Fitting, page 46, Table 3) –
the dimensioning and tightening torque are dependent 
on the bearing size.
Any deviations from the recommended size, grade and 
number of screws will considerably reduce the load 
carrying capacity and operating life of the bearings.
Permissible contact pressure
The permissible contact pressure under the screw heads and 
nuts for the adjacent construction is:
■for St37 = 260 N/mm2
■for St52 = 420 N/mm2.
If these values are exceeded, quenched and tempered washers 
must be used under the screw heads and nuts – see also 
page 42.

Location by cylindrical pot
Slewing rings are screw mounted directly to the adjacent 
construction through both bearing rings (Figure 2).
The adjacent construction must be flat and uniformly rigid, 
while the connection between the bearing adjacent 
components must be by force locking. For the upper and 
lower adjacent construction, a cylindrical pot with a flange 
ring has proved effective (Figure 2).
The wall thickness t of the pot should be approximately one 
third of the flange thickness s and the pot height HT should be 
at least five times the flange thickness s (Figure 2). For a more 
uniform rigidity of the bearing arrangement, thicker walls of the 
pot and flange ring are more favourable than thin walls with ribs.
In order to achieve the most linear force flow possible, arrange 
the pot precisely above or below the row of rolling elements.
Dimensioning of the flange thickness
Flange rings should be dimensioned such that they 
support the whole width of the bearing rings (Figure 2).
The recommended flange thickness s can be determined 
(Figure 3) using the specific load Qspec (formula) and the ratio 
DM/DW (Figure 3).

The values are applicable to:

■bearings where the static load carrying capacity is used 
to the full. If loads are considerably lower, the flange 
thickness s can be reduced to approximately 80% of the 
recommended value. In such cases, please consult INA.

Design of bearing arrangements
Permissible flatness and perpendicularity deviation of 
the adjacent construction
The screw mounting surfaces of the adjacent construction 
must fulfil the following requirements:
■the flatness deviation must not exceed the permissible 
value B (Figure 4)
■the perpendicularity deviation must not exceed the 
permissible value W (Figure 5).
Permissible flatness deviation
The flatness deviation B applies in the circumferential  and 
transverse direction  (Figure 4):
■in the circumferential direction, it can only be reached once 
in a sector of 180°. The permissible curve is similar to a 
slowly rising or slowly falling sine curve.
The permissible flatness deviation for four point contact 
bearings of a standard design (i.e. with internal clearance) 
is determined using this formula:
The following formula is valid for:
■through hardened bearings
■preloaded four point contact bearings
■crossed roller bearings.

deviation B (W  0,5 B). For other flange widths, 
the permissible deviation can be converted proportionally.

Fitting
Slewing rings must be handled with care before and during 
assembly. Their function and operating life are also dependent 
on the care taken in fitting.
Design of the assembly area
Machines, equipment, etc. that produce swarf or 
generate dust must not be used in the immediate vicinity 
of the assembly area.
The bearings must be protected against dust, 
contamination, swarf, moisture, adhesives, etc. 
Contamination will impair the function and operating 
life of the bearings.
Bearings should be fitted in a workshop if possible. If this is not 
possible, the fitting position and bearing should be protected 
against contaminant from the environment.
It must be ensured that work surfaces are bright, clean and free 
from fibres (e.g. plastic) and that lighting conditions are good.
Preparing the adjacent construction for fitting of the 
bearings
The bores and edges of the adjacent components must be free 
from burrs:
■any burrs present must be removed using an oilstone 
(Figure 1).
The support surfaces for the bearing rings must be clean.
Cleaning (Figure 1):
■apply cleaning agents using a brush or a suitable,
lint-free cloth.
■remove any foreign matter and dry the surfaces.
Ensure that all adjacent components and lubrication 
ducts are free from cleaning agents, solvents and 
washing emulsions. The bearing seating surfaces can 
rust or the raceway system can become contaminated.
Checking the seating and screw mounting surfaces for 
the bearing on the adjacent construction
■Check the surface quality and the geometrical accuracy 
of the screw mounting surfaces in accordance with the 
section Design of bearing arrangements or the assembly 
drawing.
■Check the flange thickness s, the pot height HT and 
the pot wall thickness t in accordance with the section 
Design of bearing arrangements or the assembly drawing 
(Figure 2).
■Check the flatness and perpendicularity deviation of the 
adjacent construction in accordance with the section Design 
of bearing arrangements or the assembly drawing (page 38).
Do not exceed the permissible deviations.

Storage and storage life of slewing rings
Bearings should only be stored lying down, 
never standing up (Figure 3).
The storage life of the bearings is limited by the storage life 
of the grease. Experience shows that the greases with a mineral 
oil base used can be stored for up to 3 years if the following 
preconditions are met:
■closed storage room
■dry, clean rooms with temperatures between 0 ºC and 
+40 ºC 
■relative atmospheric humidity not more than 65%
■no influence by chemical agents such as
– vapours, gases, fluids.
After long storage periods, the frictional torque may 
temporarily be higher than that of freshly greased bearings. 
The lubricity of the grease may also have deteriorated.
Delivered condition of slewing rings
INA slewing rings are:
■greased with a lithium complex soap grease KP2N–20 
to DIN 51825 
■dry preserved using VCI paper.
Unpacking and transporting slewing rings
Perspiration from handling leads to corrosion. Hands must be 
kept clean and dry; protective gloves should be worn if 
necessary.
Bearings should not be removed from their original packaging 
until immediately before assembly. If the original packaging is 
damaged, check the condition of the bearing.
Large bearings should only be transported lying down if 
possible.
Heavy bearings must only be transported using a hoist 
attached to the eye bolts or by means of textile slings (Figure 4). 
Bearings must not be wrapped in a chain.
Bearings should never be supported at one point only 
for lifting.

Cleaning of slewing rings
Any anti-corrosion coatings must be removed from the support 
and contact surfaces of the bearing rings before the slewing 
ring is fitted. Suitable cleaning agents include:
■petroleum, diesel oil, commercially available grease solvents 
(e.g. acetone, isopropanol).
The appropriate legal regulations relating to the use of 
cleaning agents (manufacturer’s instructions and 
regulations covering health and safety at work, 
environmental protection, etc.) must be observed.
Cleaning agents must be disposed of correctly after use.
Cleaning:
Cleaning agents must not be allowed to penetrate the 
raceway system of the slewing ring.
In slewing rings with gear teeth, the narrowest point 
of the tooth set is marked in green at the tooth tip  
(Figure 5). This marking must not be removed since 
the tooth flank backlash  is set at this point. 
■apply cleaning agents using a brush or a suitable,
lint-free cloth.
■remove any foreign matter and dry the surfaces.
Hardness gap on slewing rings
For the fitting of slewing rings, not only the marking on the tooth 
tip but also the so-called hardness gap is important.
The hardness gap is the point between the start and end 
of the raceway hardening. This point is indicated by (Figure 6):
■the indented INA logo 

Fitting
Preparations for fitting
Provision of fasteners
The specifications relating to the fasteners must be 
observed. 
Any deviations will influence:
– the effectiveness of the screw connection
– the function – e.g. the accuracy and rigidity – 
as well as the operating life of the bearings.
Fixing screws
Bearings must only be fixed using the screw types specified. 
It is essential that the information in the following sources 
is followed:
■this catalogue
■the technical proposal
■the customer’s assembly drawing.
The sizes, quantity and grades of the screws are given in the 
dimension tables or in the assembly drawing.
Permissible contact pressure
The permissible contact pressure under the screw heads and 
nuts given in Table 1 must not be exceeded. If the contact 
pressure is higher, quenched and tempered washers must be 
used under the nuts.
If screws of grade 12.9 are used, it is essential that quenched 
and tempered washers are always used.
Securing of screws
Normally, the screws are adequately secured by the correct 
preload. If regular shock loads or vibrations occur, however, 
it may be necessary to provide additional means of securing the 
screws.
Not every method of securing screws is suitable for 
slewing rings.
Never use spring washers or split washers.
General information on the securing of screws is given in 
DIN 25 201, and securing by means of adhesive in particular is 
described in DIN 25 203, issued in 1992.
If these are to be used, please consult the relevant 
manufacturers.
General safety and operating guidelines
Assembly forces must only be applied to the bearing ring 
to be fitted; they must never be directed through the 
rolling elements or seals. Avoid direct blows on the 
bearing rings.
Bearing rings should be located consecutively and 
without external load.
Bearings must not be heated using a naked flame. 
In this case, the material undergoes excessive localised 
heating, which will reduce its hardness. Furthermore, 
stresses will be induced in the bearing.
Do not cool the bearings excessively. The formation of 
condensation can lead to corrosion in the bearings and 
on the bearing seating surfaces.
Sequence of operations
The sequence depends on the design of the adjacent 
construction. The description of fitting is based on applications 
that have proved successful in practice.
If the adjacent construction is different, fit the bearing 
appropriately or consult INA.

Fitting
Fitting of slewing rings
Lightly oil or grease the bearing seating and locating surfaces 
for the bearing rings on the adjacent construction.
Lightly oil the thread of the fixing screws in order 
to prevent varying friction factors (do not oil or grease 
screws that will be secured by means of adhesive).
Positioning of slewing rings (Figure 7)
■Place the slewing ring  on the screw mounting surface 
of the adjacent construction .
■Position the hardness gap (see Hardness gap on slewing 
rings, page 41) such that the bearing ring subjected to point 
load is offset at 90° to the zone under maximum load.
■Check  that the bearing ring to be fitted is in contact with 
the adjacent construction over its whole width.
Location of slewing rings (Figure 8)
Bearing rings should be located consecutively and without 
external load:
■in the case of bearings without gear teeth, first fit the bearing 
ring subjected to point load
■in the case of bearings with gear teeth, first fit the ring 
without gear teeth.
Location:
■insert the fixing screws  – with washers if necessary – 
in the bearing ring to be fitted and tighten in steps to the 
specified tightening torque MA according to Table 3, 
page 46 
– during this process, rotate the unlocated bearing ring  
several times by a distance corresponding to several 
screw pitches
– tighten the screws in a crosswise sequence in order to 
prevent unacceptable fluctuations in the screw tensioning 
forces
■screw mount the unlocated bearing ring in the same way as 
the adjacent construction.
■check the function of the bearing (see Checking the function, 
page 45).
Hydraulic clamping device
If a hydraulic clamping device is used, the clamping forces for 
the preload must not exceed 90% of the proof stress of the 
screws 
■if hydraulic clamping devices are used, please consult INA 
on fitting preload forces.

Fitting
Fitting of slewing rings
Checking and adjustment of tooth flank backlash
In the case of slewing rings with gear teeth, the flank backlash 
of the gear teeth must be checked and if necessary adjusted 
after the bearing rings have been screw mounted to the 
adjacent construction. 
Checking (Figure 9):
■determine the flank backlash at the point marked in green on 
the tooth tip  – e.g. using a feeler gauge
■adjust the backlash to the nominal value of 0,03 to 
0,04modulus
– this is the standard flank backlash jn in accordance with 
DIN 868 and DIN 3960.
Measuring the tilting clearance
The tilting clearance S tilt increases during operation. 
In order to allow the increase to be calculated, the tilting 
clearance of the fitted bearing must be determined before 
it is first put into operation.
The tilting clearance S tilt consists of:
■the tilting clearance of the bearing when new
■the elastic deformations in the bearing and the adjacent 
construction
– mark the measurement point in the main load direction for 
subsequent checking by measurement .
– note the measured value (see TPI 13).
The measurement point is located between the lower 
adjacent construction and the bearing ring screw mounted to 
the upper construction (Figure 10).
The maximum permissible increase in the tilting clearance is 
shown in Table 2.
1) DW is the rolling element diameter in mm.

Fitting
Checking the function
Once assembly is complete, the operation of the fitted slewing 
ring must be checked.
If the bearing runs irregularly or roughly, or the 
temperature in the bearing shows an unusual increase, 
dismantle and check the bearing and reassemble the 
bearing in accordance with the fitting guidelines in this 
catalogue or INA Technical Product Information TPI 13.
Rotational resistance
The rotational resistance is essentially determined by 
(see also Rotational resistance, page 22):
■the rolling resistance of the rolling elements
■the internal clearance or bearing preload
■the friction of the spacers
■the friction of the seals
■the grease
■a deformed or defective adjacent construction
■errors in fitting of the bearings.
Due to the preload in the raceway system, the rotational 
resistance is higher than in a bearing with clearance.
At higher speeds, a high preload can lead to generation 
of significant heat in the bearing; if necessary tests 
must be carried out with bearings preloaded to various 
values.
Bearing temperature
After initial operation, the temperature in the bearing can 
increase – in the case of grease lubrication, for example, until 
the grease is evenly distributed in the bearing arrangement.
A further increase or unusually high temperatures may be 
caused by one of the following:
■the bearing is lubricated using an unsuitable grease
■there is excessive lubricant in the bearing
■the load on the bearing is excessively high
■the bearings are fitted unevenly
■the adjacent construction deviates from the specifications.
Safety checks
After each period of 500 hours of operation, but at least 
every six months, check and if necessary correct or 
replace:
– the condition and tightening torque of the fixing screws
– the tilting clearance.
A failure to follow these instructions can lead to 
considerable personal injury or damage to property.
The procedure and scope of the safety checks is described 
in detail in INA Technical Product Information TPI 13. 
This TPI is supplied with slewing rings and can also be 
requested from INA.

Crossed roller bearings
with external gear teeth, with internal gear teeth, 
without gear teeth
Features
Crossed roller bearings
■are units comprising inner and outer rings with a closing 
plug and securing dowel, rolling elements, spacers, 
contact seals and lubrication nipples
– gear teeth on the outer ring, inner ring or without gear 
teeth
– bearing rings with through holes or threaded holes for 
fixing screws
■are suitable for circumferential speeds
up to 2 m/s (n · DM = 38 200), for short periods
up to 2,6 m/s (n · DM = 49 700)
■can support high radial loads, moderate axial loads and 
tilting moment loads
– can support higher dynamic loads than four point 
contact bearings
■are suitable for supported and suspended loads
■are preloaded
■are used
– where zero operating clearance or preload is required
– if the rotational resistance must be particularly uniform
– where there are high requirements for accuracy and 
rigidity of the bearing arrangement
■have contact seals on both sides that protect the raceway 
system against dust, contamination and moisture
■are greased with a lithium complex soap grease KP2N–20 
according to DIN 51825, but can also be lubricated 
with oil
■are suitable for operating temperatures from –25 °C to 
+80 °C
■are very easy to fit since the bearing rings are screw 
mounted directly to the adjacent construction
■are also available in series XA, XI, XU.

Vibratory grinding unit
Carousel and container
Vibratory grinding is a process used, for example, to deburr, 
descale, smooth, precision grind or polish products of widely 
varying geometry made from a wide variety of materials.
The unit shown has two containers arranged on a carousel 
parallel to the central axis. The containers rotate about their 
common axis.
Grinding elements of a specific shape and the workpieces to be 
ground are fed into the container as a loose mixture. Due to 
centrifugal force and the relative motion between the carousel 
and the containers, a relative motion is induced between 
the grinding elements and workpieces.
After grinding, the grinding elements and workpieces are 
separated by means of a separating sieve or magnetic 
separators. The finished batches are discharged, for example 
on conveyor belts.
INA design solution
The bearing arrangements of the carousel and containers are 
based on a four point contact bearing of series VLU 20. 
The slewing ring is designed such that the three bearing 
positions in the machine can be fitted with the same bearing.
The bearing arrangement:
■allows the required centre clearance
■allows high circumferential speeds (3,5 m/s)
■is easy to fit and cost-effective.
The bearings can support axial, radial and tilting moment 
loads and the bearings on the containers can also support 
the resulting centrifugal forces. The maximum operating 
temperature is +140 °C.
The particular features of the bearings are:
■ground raceways
■guidance of the rolling elements by a brass strip cage
■optimised surface quality in the bearing gap
■lubrication with lithium complex grease
■FPM seals resistant to high temperatures.

Tandem roller
Self-aligning articulated coupling
The tandem roller described is fitted with two smooth tyres 
integrated in the front and rear support frames. It compacts 
asphalt layers, load-bearing layers and anti-frost layers in 
new construction and repair work. These rollers work on the 
vibration principle, are highly manoeuvrable and
self-manoeuvring within a very small space.
The tyres are linked to each other by steering cylinders and
self-aligning articulated couplings. For steering, the articulated 
coupling moves about the vertical axis. Surface irregularities 
are compensated by the articulated coupling on the rear tyre.
In order that the tyres can perform oscillating motion about their 
horizontal axis, a bearing is fitted between the articulated 
coupling and the rear frame. This bearing is subjected in 
some instances to very high loads and shock loads. It must 
support radial forces, axial forces, tilting moments and vibration 
loads. The coupling must operate without stick-slip and it 
must be capable of motion even after the tandem roller has 
been idle for a considerable period. The bearing must be sealed 
and maintenance-free.
INA design solution
In order to prevent edge loads on the roller, a four point contact 
bearing VU without gear teeth is fitted as a linkage point. 
Since only small oscillating movements occur, the bearing 
can be of a full complement ball design. Its favourable cross-
section and the full complement design give a space-saving, 
compact bearing arrangement with high load carrying capacity. 
This slewing ring supports radial and axial forces as well as 
tilting moments with only one bearing position. In order that 
the steering can operate without stick-slip, the bearing is 
clearance-free and preloaded. For ease of fitting, the bearing 
rings are screw mounted to the adjacent construction.
L-section seals on both sides of the four point contact bearing 
protect the running system against dust, contamination and 
moisture.
The maintenance-free bearing is greased with a high quality 
lithium complex soap grease KP2N–20 to DIN 51825.
It can be relubricated via taper type lubrication nipples.
For steering motion about the vertical axis, maintenance-free 
ELGOGLIDE® angular contact spherical plain bearings GE..SW 
are fitted.

Vertical machining centre
Tool changer
Machining centres of this machine concept are used for 
milling operations on tools, shapes and production parts. 
Due to their flexibility, precision, cutting performance and 
favourable set-up and ancillary costs, they are highly suitable 
not only in the traditional areas of tool and die production 
but also in sectors such as medical equipment, the optical 
industry, aerospace and automotive engineering.
The tool moves in three axes. Due to the high dynamic 
characteristics irrespective of the workpiece, high rapid 
traverse movement and feed values are possible. Tool change 
is effected without the use of a gripper arm and is carried out 
automatically by the pick-up method. The tool magazine is in 
the form of a ring magazine and has 38 tool spaces. For more 
complex machining tasks, it can be expanded to 87 spaces.
In order to reduce set-up and ancillary costs, the magazine 
must allow rapid tool change while the tools are nevertheless 
held securely in the magazine. The changer must support 
the mass of the tools and must be maintenance-free. In order 
to prevent tool contamination, the magazine must be located 
in a protected area of the machine. The bearing must be 
compact and require little space while having an effective 
sealing system.
INA design solution
A four point contact bearing VI with gear teeth is used as a tool 
magazine. The plastic holders for the tools are screw mounted 
to the outer ring of the bearing. This saves on space and 
reduces the total number of parts for the magazine. The tool 
changer is rotated by means of the gear teeth on the bearing 
inner ring and a pinion; the tools are positioned precisely by 
the machine control system. 
The cross-section of the four point contact bearing is very small 
in relation to its bearing diameter. This gives a very compact 
construction requiring little axial space. The magazine is 
integrated in the machine body outside the machining area and 
is loaded with tools from the side.
An axial seal on the underside of the four point contact bearing 
and a radial seal profile on the upper side protect the running 
system against contamination and moisture. The radial seal has 
an additional outer labyrinth seal.
The bearing is greased with a high quality lithium complex soap 
grease KP2N–20 to DIN 51825 and can be relubricated via 
two taper type lubrication nipples.
