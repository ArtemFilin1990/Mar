●Classification and Characteristics of Rolling Bearings
1.1  Rolling bearing construction
Most rolling bearings consist of rings with raceway (an
inner ring and an outer ring), rolling elements (either balls
or rollers) and a rolling element retainer.  The retainer
separates the rolling elements at regular intervals holds
them in place within the inner and outer raceways, and
allows them to rotate freely.  See Figs. 1.1 - 1.8.
Rolling elements come in two general shapes: ball or
rollers.  Rollers come in four basic styles: cylindrical,
needle, tapered, and spherical.
Balls geometrically contact the raceway surfaces of the
inner and outer rings at "points", while the contact surface
of rollers is a "line" contact.
Theoretically, rolling bearings are so constructed as to
allow the rolling elements to rotate orbitally while also
rotating on their own axes at the same time.
While the rolling elements and the bearing rings take
any load applied to the bearings (at the contact point
between the rolling elements and raceway surfaces), the
retainer takes no direct load.  It only serves to hold the
rolling units at equal distances from each other and
prevent them from falling out.
1.2  Classification of rolling bearings
Rolling bearings fall into two main classifications: ball
bearings and roller bearings.  Ball bearings are classified
according to their bearing ring configurations: deep
groove, angular contact and thrust types.  Roller bearings
on the other hand are classified according to the shape of
the rollers: cylindrical, needle, taper and spherical.
Rolling bearings can be further classified according to
the direction in which the load is applied; radial bearings
carry radial loads and thrust bearings carry axial loads.
Other classification methods include: 1) number of
rolling rows (single, multiple, or 4-row), 2) separable and
non-separable, in which either the inner ring or the outer
ring can be detached, 3) thrust bearings which can carry
axial loads in only one direction, and double direction
thrust bearings which can carry loads in both directions.
There are also bearings designed for special
applications, such as: railway car journal roller bearings
(RCT bearings), ball screw support bearings, turntable
bearings, as well as rectilinear motion bearings (linear
ball bearings, linear roller bearings and linear flat roller
bearings).

1.3  Characteristics of rolling bearings
1.3.1 Characteristics of rolling bearings
Rolling bearings come in many shapes and varieties,
each with its own distinctive features.
However, when compared with sliding bearings, rolling
bearings all have the following advantages:
(1) The starting friction coefficient is lower and there is
little difference between this and the dynamic
friction coefficient is produced.
(2) They are internationally standardized, interchangeable
and readily obtainable.
(3) They are easy to lubricate and consume less
lubricant.
(4) As a general rule, one bearing can carry both radial
and axial loads at the same time.
(5) May be used in either high or low temperature
applications.
(6) Bearing rigidity can be improved by preloading.
Construction, classes, and special features of rolling
bearings are fully described in the boundary dimensions
and bearing numbering system section.
1.3.2  Ball bearings and roller bearings
Generally speaking, when comparing ball and roller
bearings of the same dimensions, ball bearings exhibit a
lower frictional resistance and lower face run-out in
rotation than roller bearings.
This makes them more suitable for use in applications
which require high speed, high precision, low torque and
low vibration. Conversely, roller bearings have a larger
load carrying capacity which makes them more suitable
for applications requiring long life and endurance for
heavy loads and shock loads.
1.3.3  Radial and thrust bearings
Almost all types of rolling bearings can carry both radial
and axial loads at the same time.
Generally, bearings with a contact angle of less than
45°have a much greater radial load capacity and are
classed as radial bearings; whereas bearings which have
a contact angle over 45°have a greater axial load
capacity and are classed as thrust bearings. There are
also bearings classed as complex bearings which
combine the loading characteristics of both radial and
thrust bearings.
1.3.4  Standard bearings and special bearings
Bearings which are internationally standardized as to
shape and size are much more economical to use, as
they are interchangeable and available on a worldwide
basis.
However, depending on the type of machine they are to
be used in, and the expected application and function, a
non-standard or specially designed bearing may be best
to use. Bearings that are adapted to specific applications,
and "unit bearings" which are integrated (built-in) into a
machine's components, and other specially designed
bearings are also available.

Selection of bearing type and configuration
(1) Dimensional limitations
The allowable space for bearings is typically limited.
In most cases, shaft diameter (or the bearing bore
diameter) has been determined according to the
machine’s other design specifications. Therefore, a
bearing’s type and dimensions are determined
according to standard bearing bore diameters. For this
reason all dimension tables are organized according to
standard bore diameters. There is a wide range of
standardized bearing types and dimensions: the right
one for a particular application can usually be found in
these tables.
(2) Bearing load
The characteristics, magnitude, and direction of loads
acting upon a bearing are extremely variable. In
general, the basic rated loads shown in bearing
dimension tables indicate their load capacity. However,
in determining the appropriate bearing type,
consideration must also be given to whether the acting
load is a radial load only or an axial load only, or
combined radial and axial load, etc. When ball and
roller bearings within the same dimension series are
considered, the roller bearings have a larger load
capacity and are also capable of withstanding greater
vibration and shock loads. 
(3) Rotational speed
The allowable speed of a bearing will differ
depending upon bearing type, size, tolerances, cage
type, load, lubricating conditions, and cooling
conditions.
The allowable speeds listed in the bearing tables for
grease and oil lubrication are for standard NTN
bearings. In general, deep groove ball bearings,
angular contact ball bearings, and cylindrical roller
bearings are most suitable for high speed applications. 
(4) Bearing tolerances
The dimensional accuracy and operating tolerances
of bearings are regulated by ISO and JIS standards.
For equipment requiring high tolerance shaft runout or
high speed operation, etc., bearings with Class 5
tolerance or higher are recommended. Deep groove
ball bearings, angular contact ball bearings, and
cylindrical roller bearings are recommended for high
rotational tolerances. 
(5) Rigidity
Elastic deformation occurs along the contact surfaces
of a bearing’s rolling elements and raceway surfaces
when under load. With certain types of equipment it is
necessary to reduce this deformation as much as
2.  Bearing Selection
Rolling element bearings are available in a variety of
types, configurations, and sizes. When selecting the
correct bearing for your application, it is important to
consider several factors, such as the calculation of
various angles and clearances, which will ensure proper
fit. A comparison of the performance characteristics for
each bearing type is shown in Table 2.1. As a general
guideline, the basic procedure for selecting the most
appropriate bearing is shown in the following flow chart.

possible. Roller bearings exhibit less elastic
deformation than ball bearings, and therefore are
recommended for such equipment. Furthermore, in
some cases, bearings are given an initial load
(preloaded) to increase their shafting rigidity. This
procedure is commonly applied to deep groove ball
bearings, angular contact ball bearings, and tapered
roller bearings.
(6) Misalignment of inner and outer rings
Shaft flexure, variations in shaft or housing accuracy,
and fitting errors, etc. result in a certain degree of
misalignment between the bearing’s inner and outer
rings. In cases where the degree of misalignment is
likely to be relatively large, self-aligning ball bearings,
spherical roller bearings, or bearing units with self-
aligning properties are the most appropriate choices.
(Refer to Fig. 2.1)
(7) Noise and torque levels
Rolling bearings are manufactured and processed
according to high precision standards, and therefore
generally produce only slight amounts of noise and
torque. For applications requiring particularly low-noise
or low-torque operation, deep groove ball bearings and
cylindrical roller bearings are most appropriate. 
(8) Installation and disassembly
Some applications require frequent disassembly and
reassembly to enable periodic inspections and repairs.
For such applications, bearings with separable
inner/outer rings, such as cylindrical roller bearings,
needle roller bearings, and tapered roller bearings are
most appropriate. Incorporation of adapter sleeves
simplifies the installation and disassembly of self-
aligning ball bearings and spherical roller bearings with
tapered bores.

2.3 Selection of bearing arrangement
Shaft assemblies generally require two bearings to
support and locate the shaft radially and axially, relative to
the stationary housing. These two bearings are called the
“fixed-side” and “floating-side” bearings. The fixed-side
bearing “fixes” or controls movement of the shaft axially in
relation to the housing. The floating-side bearing moves or
“floats” axially in relation to the housing and is therefore
able to relieve stress caused by the expansion and
contraction of the shaft due to temperature fluctuations,
and allow for misalignment caused by fitting errors. 
Fixed-side bearings have the capacity to receive both
axial and radial loads, and therefore a bearing which
controls axial movement in both directions should be
selected. Floating-side bearings receive only radial loads,
and therefore bearings which are mounted to permit free
axial movement, or bearings with separable inner and
outer rings are most desirable. Cylindrical roller bearings
are generally separable and allow for axial displacement
along their raceway surfaces; deep groove ball bearings
are non-separable, but can be mounted to allow for
displacement along their fitting surfaces.
In applications with short distances between bearings,
shaft expansion and contraction due to temperature
fluctuations is slight, therefore the same type of bearing
may be used for both the fixed-side and floating-side
bearing. In such cases it is common to use a set of
matching bearings, such as angular contact ball bearings,
to guide and support the shaft in one axial direction only. 
Table 2.2 (1) shows representative bearing
arrangements where the bearing type differs on the fixed
side and floating side. Table 2.2 (2) shows some
common bearing arrangements where no distinction is
made between the fixed side and floating side. Vertical
shaft bearing arrangements are shown in Table 2.2 (3).
1. General arrangement for small machinery.

3.  Load Rating and Life
3.1  Bearing life
Even in bearings operating under normal conditions, the
surfaces of the raceway and rolling elements are
constantly being subjected to repeated compressive
stresses which causes flaking of these surfaces to occur.
This flaking is due to material fatigue and will eventually
cause the bearings to fail.  The effective life of a bearing
is usually defined in terms of the total number of
revolutions a bearing can undergo before flaking of either
the raceway surface or the rolling element surfaces
occurs.
Other causes of bearing failure are often attributed to
problems such as seizing, abrasions, cracking, chipping,
gnawing, rust, etc.  However, these so called "causes" of
bearing failure are usually themselves caused by
improper installation, insufficient or improper lubrication,
faulty sealing or inaccurate bearing selection. Since the
above mentioned "causes" of bearing failure can be
avoided by taking the proper precautions, and are not
simply caused by material fatigue, they are considered
separately from the flaking aspect.
3.2  Basic rating life and basic dynamic load rating
A group of seemingly identical bearings when subjected
to identical load and operating conditions will exhibit a
wide diversity in their durability.
This "life" disparity can be accounted for by the
difference in the fatigue of the bearing material itself.
This disparity is considered statistically when calculating
bearing life, and the basic rating life is defined as follows.
The basic rating life is based on a 90% statistical model
which is expressed as the total number of revolutions
90% of the bearings in an identical group of bearings
subjected to identical operating conditions will attain or
surpass before flaking due to material fatigue occurs.  For
bearings operating at fixed constant speeds, the basic
rating life (90% reliability) is expressed in the total number
of hours of operation.
The basic dynamic load rating is an expression of the
load capacity of a bearing based on a constant load
which the bearing can sustain for one million revolutions
(the basic life rating).  For radial bearings this rating
applies to pure radial loads, and for thrust bearings it
refers to pure axial loads.  The basic dynamic load ratings
given in the bearing tables of this catalog are for bearings
constructed of NTN standard bearing materials, using
standard manufacturing techniques. Please consult NTN
Engineering for basic load ratings of bearings constructed
of special materials or using special manufacturing
techniques.
The relationship between the basic rating life, the basic
dynamic load rating and the bearing load is given in
formula (3.1).

When several bearings are incorporated in machines
or equipment as complete units, all the bearings in the
unit are considered as a whole when computing bearing
life (see formula 3.6).  The total bearing life of the unit is
a life rating based on the viable lifetime of the unit before
even one of the bearings fails due to rolling contact
fatigue.

3.3  Machine applications and requisite life
When selecting a bearing, it is essential that the
requisite life of the bearing be established in relation to
the operating conditions.  The requisite life of the bearing
is usually determined by the type of machine in which the
bearing will be used, and duration of service and
operational reliability requirements. A general guide to
these requisite life criteria is shown in Table 3.1. When
determining bearing size, the fatigue life of the bearing is
an important factor; however, besides bearing life, the
strength and rigidity of the shaft and housing must also be
taken into consideration.
3.4  Adjusted life rating factor
The basic bearing life rating (90% reliability factor) can
be calculated through the formulas mentioned earlier in
Section 5.2.  However, in some applications a bearing life
factor of over 90% reliability may be required.  To meet
these requirements, bearing life can be lengthened by the
use of specially improved bearing materials or special
construction techniques. Moreover, according to
elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, it is clear that the
bearing operating conditions (lubrication, temperature,
speed, etc.) all exert an effect on bearing life.  All these
adjustment factors are taken into consideration when
calculating bearing life, and using the life adjustment
factor as prescribed in ISO 281, the adjusted bearing life
can be determined.

3.4.1  Life adjustment factor for reliability a1
The values for the reliability adjustment factor a1 (for a
reliability factor higher than 90%) can be found in Table
3.2.
3.4.2  Life adjustment factor for material a2
The life of a bearing is affected by the material type and
quality as well as the manufacturing process. In this
regard, the life is adjusted by the use of an a2 factor.
The basic dynamic load ratings listed in the catalog are
based on NTN's standard material and process,
therefore, the adjustment factor a2 =1. When special
materials or processes are used the adjustment factor
can be larger than 1.
NTN bearings can generally be used up to 120˚C. If
bearings are operated at a higher temperature, the
bearing must be specially heat treated (stabilized) so that
inadmissible dimensional change does not occur due to
changes in the micro-structure. This special heat
treatment might cause the reduction of bearing life
because of a hardness change.
3.4.3  Life adjustment factor a3 for operating conditions
The operating conditions life adjustment factor a3 is
used to adjust for such conditions as lubrication,
operating temperature, and other operation factors which
have an effect on bearing life.
Generally speaking, when lubricating conditions are
satisfactory, the a3 factor has a value of one; and when
lubricating conditions are exceptionally favorable, and all
other operating conditions are normal, a3 can have a
value greater than one.
However, when lubricating conditions are particularly
unfavorable and the oil film formation on the contact
surfaces of the raceway and rolling elements is
insufficient, the value of a3 becomes less than one. This

insufficient oil film formation can be caused, for example,
by the lubricating oil viscosity being too low for the
operating temperature (below 13 mm2/s for ball bearings;
below 20 mm2/s for roller bearings); or by exceptionally
low rotational speed (nr/min x dpmm less than 10,000).
For bearings used under special operating conditions,
please consult NTN Engineering.
As the operating temperature of the bearing increases,
the hardness of the bearing material decreases. Thus, the
bearing life correspondingly decreases. The operating
temperature adjustment values are shown in Fig. 3.2.
3.5  Basic static load rating
When stationary rolling bearings are subjected to static
loads, they suffer from partial permanent deformation of
the contact surfaces at the contact point between the
rolling elements and the raceway.  The amount of
deformity increases as the load increases, and if this
increase in load exceeds certain limits, the subsequent
smooth operation of the bearings is impaired.
It has been found through experience that a permanent
deformity of 0.0001 times the diameter of the rolling
element, occurring at the most heavily stressed contact
point between the raceway and the rolling elements, can
be tolerated without any impairment in running efficiency.
The basic rating static load refers to a fixed static load
limit at which a specified amount of permanent
deformation occurs. It applies to pure radial loads for
radial bearings and to pure axial loads for thrust bearings.
The maximum applied load values for contact stress
occurring at the rolling element and raceway contact
points are given below.

3.6  Allowable static equivalent load
Generally the static equivalent load which can be
permitted (See Section 4.4.2 page A-23) is limited by the
basic static rating load as stated in Section 5.5.
However, depending on requirements regarding friction
and smooth operation, these limits may be greater or
lesser than the basic static rating load.
In the following formula (3.9) and Table 3.4 the safety
factor S0 can be determined considering the maximum
static equivalent load.

To compute bearing loads, the forces which act on the
shaft being supported by the bearing must be
determined. These forces include the inherent dead
weight of the rotating body (the weight of the shafts and
components themselves), loads generated by the
working forces of the machine, and loads arising from
transmitted power.
It is possible to calculate theoretical values for these
loads; however, there are many instances where the
load acting on the bearing is usually determined by the
nature of the load acting on the main power
transmission shaft.
4.1  Load acting on shafts
4.1.1   Load factor
There are many instances where the actual operational
shaft load is much greater than the theoretically
calculated load, due to machine vibration and/or shock. 
This actual shaft load can be found by using formula
(4.1).

where,
K ：Actual shaft load   N｛kgf｝
fw ：Load factor (Table 4.1)
Kc：Theoretically calculated value   N｛kgf｝
4.1.2   Gear load
The loads operating on gears can be divided into three
main types according to the direction in which the load is
applied; i.e. tangential (Kt), radial (Ks), and axial (Ka).
The magnitude and direction of these loads differ
according to the types of gears involved. The load
calculation methods given herein are for two general-use
gear and shaft arrangements: parallel shaft gears, and
cross shaft gears. For load calculation methods
regarding other types of gear and shaft arrangements,
please consult NTN Engineering.
(1)Loads acting on parallel shaft gears
The forces acting on spur and helical parallel shaft
gears are depicted in Figs. 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. The load
magnitude can be found by using or formulas (4.2),
through (4.4).

Because the actual gear load also contains vibrations
and shock loads as well, the theoretical load obtained by
the above formula should also be adjusted by the gear
factor fz as shown in Table 4.2.
(2)Loads acting on cross shafts
Gear loads acting on straight tooth bevel gears and
spiral bevel gears on cross shafts are shown in Figs. 4.4
and 4.5. The calculation methods for these gear loads are
shown in Table 4.3. Herein, to calculate gear loads for
straight bevel gears, the helix angle β= 0.

4.1.2   Chain / belt shaft load

vibrations and shock loads are taken into consideration.

supported by the bearings, and any loads acting on the
shafts are distributed to the bearings.
For example, in the gear shaft assembly depicted in
Fig. 4.7, the applied bearing loads can be found by using
formulas (4.10) and (4.11).

●Bearing Load Calculation
4.3   Mean load
The load on bearings used in machines under normal
circumstances will, in many cases, fluctuate according to
a fixed time period or planned operation schedule. The
load on bearings operating under such conditions can be
converted to a mean load (Fm), this is a load which gives
bearings the same life they would have under constant
operating conditions.
(1) Fluctuating stepped load 
The mean bearing load, Fm, for stepped loads is
calculated from formula (4.12). F1 , F2 ....... Fn are the
loads acting on the bearing; n1, n2.......nn and t1, t2.......
tn are the bearing speeds and operating times
respectively.

4.4   Equivalent load
4.4.1  Dynamic equivalent load
When both dynamic radial loads and dynamic axial
loads act on a bearing at the same time, the hypothetical
load acting on the center of the bearing which gives the
bearings the same life as if they had only a radial load or
only an axial load is called the dynamic equivalent load.
For radial bearings, this load is expressed as pure
radial load and is called the dynamic equivalent radial
load. For thrust bearings, it is expressed as pure axial
load, and is called the dynamic equivalent axial load.
(1) Dynamic equivalent radial load
The dynamic equivalent radial load is expressed by
formula (4.17).
where, 
Pr：Dynamic equivalent radial load,   N
Fr：Actual radial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
X ：Radial load factor
Y ：Axial load factor
The values for X and Y are listed in the bearing tables.
(2) Dynamic equivalent axial load
As a rule, standard thrust bearings with a contact angle
of 90˚ cannot carry radial loads. However, self-aligning
thrust roller bearings can accept some radial load. The
dynamic equivalent axial load for these bearings is
given in formula (4.18).
Pa＝Fa＋1.2Fr………………（4.18）
where,
Pa：Dynamic equivalent axial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
Fr：Actual radial load,   N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦0.55 only.
4.4.2 Static equivalent load
The static equivalent load is a hypothetical load which
would cause the same total permanent deformation at the
most heavily stressed contact point between the rolling
elements and the raceway as under actual load
conditions; that is when both static radial loads and static
axial loads are simultaneously applied to the bearing.
For radial bearings this hypothetical load refers to pure
radial loads, and for thrust bearings it refers to pure
centric axial loads.  These loads are designated static
equivalent radial loads and static equivalent axial loads
respectively.
(1) Static equivalent radial load
For radial bearings the static equivalent radial load can
be found by using formula (4.19) or (4.20). The greater
of the two resultant values is always taken for Por.
Por＝Xo Fr＋Yo Fa…（4.19）
Por＝Fr …………… （4.20）
where,
Por：Static equivalent radial load,   N
Fr ：Actual radial load,   N
Fa ：Actual axial load,   N
Xo：Static radial load factor
Yo ：Static axial load factor
The values for Xo and Yo are given in the respective
bearing tables.
(2) Static equivalent axial load
For spherical thrust roller bearings the static equivalent
axial load is expressed by formula (4.21).
Poa＝Fa＋2.7Fr…（4.21）
where,
Poa：Static equivalent axial load,   N
Fa ：Actual axial load,   N
Fr ：Actual radial load,   N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦0.55 only.

4.4.3  Load calculation for angular ball bearings and
tapered roller bearings
For angular ball bearings and tapered roller bearings
the pressure cone apex (load center) is located as shown
in Fig. 4.12, and their values are listed in the bearing
tables.
When radial loads act on these types of bearings the
component force is induced in the axial direction. For this
reason, these bearings are used in pairs (either DB or DF
arrangements). For load calculation this component force
must be taken into consideration and is expressed by
formula (4.22).
Fa ＝0.5Fr …………………（4.22）

The equivalent radial loads for these bearing pairs are
given in Table 4.5.

4.5 Allowable axial ioad for cylindrical roller
bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings having flanges on both the
inner and outer rings can be loaded with a certain axial
force at the same time. Unlike the basic dynamic load
rating with is determined by the development of rolling
fatigue, a permissible dynamic axial load of a rolling
cylindrical roller bearing is determined by heat generation,
seizure, etc., at the sliding contact surfaces of the guide
flanges and end faces of the rollers. The allowable axial
load is approximated by the formula below which is based
on past experience and experiments.
Pt = k・d2・Pz …………………(4.23)
where,
Pt：Allowable axial load during rotation N｛kgf｝
k ：Coefficient determined by internal bearing 
geometry (Please refer to Table 4.6)
d ：Bore diameter of the bearings mm
Pz：Allowable face pressure (bearing stress) of the 
collar MPa (Please refer to Fig. 4.13)｛kgf/mm
2｝
However, if the ratio axial load/radial load is large,
normal rolling motion of the roller cannot be achieved. 
Therefor, a value exceeding Fa max shown in Table 4.6
should not be used.
Moreover, when applying axial loads, the following
guidelines are important;
(1)  Be carful to specify proper radial internal clearance.
(2)  Use a lubricant containing an extreme pressure 
additive.
(3)  The shaft and housing abutment height must be 
enough to cover those of the flanges. 
(4)  In case of severe axial loads, increase the mounting 
accuracy and perform test running of the bearing.
In cases of axial loads being placed on large cylindrical
roller bearings (for example, bearing diameters of 300mm
or more), large axial loads being on the bearing under low
speed consult conditions, or forces bearing applied,
please consult with NTN Engineering. For cylindrical roller
bearings subjected to high axial use Type HT, Please
consult NTN Engineering.

●Bearing Load Calculation
4.6  Bearing rated life and load calculation
examples
In the examples given in this section, for the purpose of
calculation, all hypothetical load factors as well as all
calculated load factors may be presumed to be included
in the resultant load values.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
(Example 1)
What is the rating life in hours of operation (L10h)
for deep groove ball bearing 6208 operating at
650 r/min, with a radial load Fr of 3.2 kN ?
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
From formula (4.17) the dynamic equivalent radial load:
Pr＝Fr＝3.2kN｛326kgf｝
The basic dynamic rated load for bearing 6208 (from
bearing table) is 29.1 kN, and the speed factor (fn) for ball
bearings at 650 r/min (n) from Fig. 4.1 is 0.37.  The life
factor, fh, from formula (3.3) is:
f h＝fn Cr ＝0.37× 29.1 ＝3.36
Pr
3.2
Therefore, with fh = 3.36 from Fig. 3.1 the rated life, L10h,
is approximately 19,000 hours.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
(Example 2)
What is the life rating L10h for the same bearing and
conditions as in Example 1, but with an additional
axial load Fa of 1.8 kN ?
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
To find the dynamic equivalent radial load value for Pr,
the radial load factor X and axial load factor Y are used.
The basic static load rating, Cor, for bearing 6208 is 17.8
kN.
Fa ＝1.8 ＝0.10
Cor
17.8
Therefore, from the bearing tables e= 0.29.
For the operating radial load and axial load:
Fa ＝1.8
＝0.56＞e=0.29
Fr
3.2
From the bearing tables X = 0.56 and Y = 1.48, and
from formula (4.17) the equivalent radial load, Pr, is:
Pr＝XFr＋YFa＝0.56×3.2＋1.48×1.8
＝4.46
kN｛455kgf｝
From Fig. 3.1 and formula (3.3) the life factor, fh, is:
f h＝fn Cr ＝0.37× 29.1 ＝2.41
Pr
4.46
Therefore, with life factor fh = 2.41, from Fig. 5.1 the
rated life, L10h, is approximately 7,000 hours.

From Fig. 3.1 the life factor fh = 3.02 (L10h at 20,000),

●Boundary Dimensions and Bearing Number Codes
5.1 Boundary dimensions
A rolling bearing's major dimensions, known as
"boundary dimensions," are shown in Figs. 5.1 - 5.3. To
facilitate international bearing interchangeability and
economical bearing production, bearing boundary
dimensions have been standardized by the International
Standards Organization (ISO). In Japan, rolling bearing
boundary dimensions are regulated by Japanese Industrial
Standards (JIS B 1512). 
Those boundary dimensions which have been
standardized include: bearing bore diameter, outside
diameter, width/height, and chamfer dimensions - all
important dimensions when considering the compatibility

future standardization, there are many standard bearing
dimensions which are not presently manufactured. 
Boundary dimensions for radial bearings (excluding
tapered roller bearings) are shown in the attached tables.

Bore diameter: tapered inner
ring bore, standard taper ratio 1:30
related specifications. Bearing numbers are comprised of a
"basic number" followed by "supplementary codes." The
makeup and order of bearing numbers is shown in Table 5.2.
The basic number indicates general information about a
bearing, such as its fundamental type, boundary
dimensions, series number, bore diameter code and
contact angle. The supplementary codes derive from
prefixes and suffixes which indicate a bearing's tolerances,
internal clearances, and related specifications.

●Bearing Tolerances
6.1 Dimensional accuracy and running accuracy
Bearing “tolerances” or dimensional accuracy and
running accuracy, are regulated by ISO and JIS B 1514
standards (rolling bearing tolerances). For dimensional
accuracy, these standards prescribe the tolerances
necessary when installing bearings on shafts or in
housings. Running accuracy is defined as the allowable
limits for bearing runout during operation. 
Dimensional accuracy
Dimensional accuracy constitutes the acceptable values
for bore diameter, outer diameter, assembled bearing
width, and bore diameter uniformity as seen in chamfer
dimensions, allowable inner ring tapered bore deviation
and shape error. Also included are, average bore diameter
variation average, outer diameter variation, average outer
diameter unevenness, as well as raceway width and
height variation (for thrust bearings).
Running accuracy
Running accuracy constitutes the acceptable values for
inner and outer ring radial runout and axial runout, inner
ring side runout, and outer ring outer diameter runout.
Allowable rolling bearing tolerances have been
established according to precision classes. JIS Class 0
corresponds to normal precision class bearings, and
precision becomes progressively higher as the class
number becomes smaller; i.e., Class 6 is less precise than
Class 5, which is less precise than Class 4, and so on.
Table 6.1 indicates which standards and precision
classes are applicable to the major bearing types. Table
6.2 shows a relative comparison between JIS B 1514
precision class standards and other standards. For greater
detail on allowable error limitations and values, refer to
Tables 6.3 - 6.9. Allowable values for chamfer dimensions
are shown in Table 6.10, and allowable error limitations
and values for radial bearing inner ring tapered bores are
shown in Table 6.11.

1 "ABEC" is applied for ball bearings and "RBEC" for roller bearings.
Notes 1: JIS B 1514, ISO 492 and 199, and DIN 620 have the same specification level.
2: The tolerance and allowance of JIS B 1514 are a little different from those of AFBMA standards.

¡Raceway and shaft or housing abrasion caused by
creeping and fretting corrosion
¡Seizing caused by loss of internal clearances
¡Increased noise and lowered rotational accuracy due
to raceway groove deformation
Please refer to insert pages A-93 - A94 for
information concerning diagnosis of these conditions.
7.3 Fit selection
Selection of a proper fit is dependent upon thorough
analysis of bearing operating conditions, including
consideration of:
¡Shaft and housing material, wall thickness, finished
surface accuracy, etc. 
¡Machinery operating conditions (nature and
magnitude of load, rotational speed, temperature,
etc.)
7.3.1 "Tight fit," "transition fit," or  "loose fit"
(1) For raceways under rotating loads, a tight fit is
necessary. (Refer to Table 7.1) "Raceways under
rotating loads" refers to raceways receiving loads
rotating relative to their radial direction. For raceways
under static loads, on the other hand, a loose fit is
sufficient.
(Example) Rotating inner ring load = the direction of
the radial load on the inner ring is rotating
relatively
(2) For non-separable bearings, such as deep groove ball
bearings, it is generally recommended that either the
inner ring or outer ring be given a loose fit. 
7.1 Interference
For rolling bearings, inner and outer rings are fixed on
the shaft or in the housing so that relative movement
does not occur between fitted surfaces during operation
or under load. This relative movement (referred to as
"creep") between the fitted surfaces of the bearing and
the shaft or housing can occur in a radial direction, an
axial direction, or in the direction of rotation. To help
prevent this creeping movement, bearing rings and the
shaft or housing are installed with one of three
interference fits, a "tight fit" (also called shrink fit),
"transition fit," or "loose fit" (also called clearance fit),
and the degree of interference between their fitted
surfaces varies.
The most effective way to fix the fitted surfaces
between a bearing's raceway and shaft or housing is to
apply a "tight fit." The advantage of this tight fit for thin
walled bearings is that it provides uniform load support
over the entire ring circumference without any loss of load
carrying capacity. However, with a tight fit, ease of
installation and disassembly is lost; and when using a
non-separable bearing as the floating-side bearing, axial
displacement is not possible. For this reason, a tight fit
cannot be recommended in all cases.
7.2 The necessity of a proper fit
In some cases, improper fit may lead to damage and
shorten bearing life, therefore it is necessary to make a
careful analysis in selecting a proper fit. Some of the
negative conditions caused by improper fit are listed
below.
¡Raceway cracking, early peeling and displacement of
raceway

7.3.2 Recommended Fits
Bearing fit is governed by the selection tolerances for
bearing shaft diameters and housing bore diameters. 
Widely used fits for 0 Class tolerance bearings and
various shaft and housing bore diameter tolerances are
shown in Table 7.1.
Generally-used, standard fits for most types of bearings
and operating conditions are shown in Tables 7.2 - 7.7.
Table 7.2: Fits for radial bearings
Table 7.3: Fits for thrust bearings
Table 7.4: Fits for electric motor bearings
Table 7.6: Fits for inch series tapered roller bearings
(ANSI Class 4)
Table 7.7: Fits for inch series tapered roller bearings
(ANSI Class 3 and 0)
Table 7.5. shows fits and their numerical values.
For special fits or applications, please consult NTN
Engineering. 
7.3.3 Interference minimum and maximum values
The following points should be considered when it is
necessary to calculate the interference for an application:
¡In calculating the minimum required amount of
interference keep in mind that:
1) interference is reduced by radial loads
2) interference is reduced by differences between
bearing temperature and ambient temperature
3) interference is reduced by variation of fitted
surfaces
¡Maximum interference should be no more than
1:1000 of the shaft diameter or outer diameter. 
Required interference calculations are shown below. 
(1) Radial loads and required interference 
Interference between inner rings mounted on solid
shafts is reduced when acted upon by radial loads.
Calculation of the minimum required amount of
interference in such cases is shown in formulae (7.1) and
(7.2).
Fr ≦0.3 Cor
∆dF = 0.08 (d・Fr / B)

N        ｝………(7.1)

1/2
｛kgf ｝
Fr ＞0.3 Cor
∆dF = 0.02 (Fr / B)
N        ｝………(7.2)
= 0.2 (Fr / B)
｛kgf ｝
Where,
∆dF : Required effective interference for load μm
d : Nominal bore diameter mm
B : Inner ring width mm
Fr : Radial load N｛kgf｝
Cor : Basic static rated load N｛kgf｝
(2) Temperature difference and required interference
Interference between inner rings and steel shafts is
reduced as a result of temperature increases (difference
between bearing temperature and ambient temperature,
∆T) caused by bearing rotation. Calculation of the
minimum required amount of interference in such cases is
shown in formulae (7.1).
∆dT = 0.0015 d ∆T ……………………………………(7.3)
∆dT : Required effective interference for
temperature difference μm
∆T : Difference between bearing temperature
and ambient temperature ˚C
d : Bearing bore diameter mm
(3) Fitted surface variation and required interference
Interference between fitted surfaces is reduced by
roughness and other slight variations of these surfaces
which are flattened in the fitting process. The degree of
reduced interference depends upon the finish treatment
of these surfaces, but in general it is necessary to
assume the following interference reductions.
For ground shafts: 1.0～2.5μm
For lathed shafts: 5.0～7.0μm
(4) Maximum interference
When bearing rings are installed with an interference fit,
tension or compression stress may occur along their
raceways. If interference is too great, this may cause
damage to the rings and reduce bearing life. For these
reasons, maximum interference should not exceed the
previously mentioned ratio of 1:1,000 of shaft or outside
diameter. 
7.3.4 Other details
(1) Tight interference fits are recommended for,
¡Operating conditions with large vibration or shock
loads
¡Applications using hollow shafts or housings with
thin walls
¡Applications using housings made of light alloys or
plastic
(2) Loose interference fits are preferable for,
¡Applications requiring high running accuracy
¡Applications using small sized bearings or thin
walled bearings

●Bearing Internal Clearance and Preload
8.1
Bearing internal clearance
Bearing internal clearance (initial clearance) is the
amount of internal clearance a bearing has before being
installed on a shaft or in a housing.
As shown in Fig. 8.1, when either the inner ring or the
outer ring is fixed and the other ring is free to move,
displacement can take place in either an axial or radial
direction. This amount of displacement (radially or axially)
is termed the internal clearance and, depending on the
direction, is called the radial internal clearance or the
axial internal clearance.
When the internal clearance of a bearing is measured, a
slight measurement load is applied to the raceway so the
internal clearance may be measured accurately.
However, at this time, a slight amount of elastic
deformation of the bearing occurs under the measurement
load, and the clearance measurement value (measured
clearance) is slightly larger than the true clearance. This
discrepancy between the true bearing clearance and the
increased amount due to the elastic deformation must be
compensated for. These compensation values are given in
Table 8.1. For roller bearings the amount of elastic
deformation can be ignored.
The internal clearance values for each bearing class are
shown in Tables 8.3 through 8.11.

Internal clearance selection
The internal clearance of a bearing under operating
conditions (effective clearance) is usually smaller than
the same bearing's initial clearance before being installed
and operated.  This is due to several factors including
bearing fit, the difference in temperature between the
inner and outer rings, etc.  As a bearing's operating
clearance has an effect on bearing life, heat
generation, vibration, noise, etc.; care must be taken
in selecting the most suitable operating clearance.
Effective internal clearance:
The internal clearance differential between the initial
clearance and the operating (effective) clearance (the
amount of clearance reduction caused by interference
fits, or clearance variation due to the temperature
difference between the inner and outer rings) can be
calculated by the following formula:
δeff ＝δo －（δf ＋δt ）…………………（8.1）
where,
δeff : Effective internal clearance, mm
δo : Bearing internal clearance, mm
δf : Reduced amount of clearance due to
interference, mm
δt : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
temperature differential of inner and outer 
r, mm

(1) Reduced clearance due to interference
When bearings are installed with interference fits on
shafts and in housings, the inner ring will expand and the
outer ring will contract; thus reducing the bearings'
internal clearance. The amount of expansion or
contraction varies depending on the shape of the
bearing, the shape of the shaft or housing, dimensions of
the respective parts, and the type of materials used. The
differential can range from approximately 70% to 90%
of the effective interference.
δf ＝(0.70～0.90) ∆deff …………………… (8.2)
where,
δf : Reduced amount of clearance due to
interference, mm
∆deff : Effective interference, mm
(2) Reduced internal clearance due to inner/outer ring
temperature difference.
During operation, normally the outer ring will range
from 5 to 10℃cooler than the inner ring or rotating parts.
However, if the cooling effect of the housing is large, the
shaft is connected to a heat source, or a heated
substance is conducted through the hollow shaft; the
temperature difference between the two rings can be
even greater. The amount of internal clearance is thus
further reduced by the differential expansion of the
two rings.
δt ＝α・∆T・Do………………………… (8.3)
where,
δt : Amount of reduced clearance due to heat
differential, mm
α : Bearing steel linear expansion coefficient
12.5 × 10-6/˚C
∆T : Inner/outer ring temperature differential, ℃
Do : Outer ring raceway diameter, mm
Outer ring raceway diameter, Do, values can be
approximated by using formula (8.4) or (8.5).
For ball bearings and spherical roller bearings,
Do ＝0.20 (d ＋4.0D) ……………………… (8.4)
For roller bearings (except self-aligning),
Do ＝0.25 (d ＋3.0D) ……………………… (8.5)
where,
d : Bearing bore diameter, mm
D : Bearing outside diameter, mm

8.3  Preload
Normally, bearings are used with a slight internal
clearance under operating conditions.  However, in some
applications, bearings are given an initial load; this means
that the bearings' internal clearance is negative before
operation. This is called "preload" and is commonly
applied to angular ball bearings and tapered roller
bearings.
8.3.1 Purpose of preload
Giving preload to a bearing results in the rolling element
and raceway surfaces being under constant elastic
compressive forces at their contact points. This has the
effect of making the bearing extremely rigid so that even
when load is applied to the bearing, radial or axial shaft
displacement does not occur.  Thus, the natural
frequency of the shaft is increased, which is suitable for
high speeds.
Preload is also used to prevent or suppress shaft
runout, vibration, and noise; improve running accuracy
and locating accuracy; reduce smearing, and regulate
rolling element rotation. Also, for thrust ball and roller
bearings mounted on horizontal shafts, preloading keeps
the rolling elements in proper alignment.
The most common method of preloading is to apply an
axial load to two duplex bearings so that the inner and
outer rings are displaced axially in relation to each other.
This preloading method is divided into fixed position
preload and constant pressure preload.

Preloading is accomplished by

the standard preload see Table
8.13
Preloading is accomplished by
using coil or belleville springs.
Recommended preloads are as
follows:
for deep groove ball bearings:
4～10 d　N
0.4～1.0 d ｛kgf｝
  for angular contact ball bearings:
     see Table 8.13

8.3.2 Preloading methods and amounts
The basic pattern, purpose and characteristics of
bearing preloads are shown in Table 8.12.  The definite
position preload is effective for positioning the two
bearings and also for increasing the rigidity.  Due to the
use of a spring for the constant pressure preload, the
preloading amount can be kept constant, even when the
distance between the two bearings fluctuates under the
influence of operating heat and load.
Also, the standard preloading amount for the paired
angular contact ball bearings is shown in Table 8.13.
Light and normal preload is applied to prevent general
vibration, and medium and heavy preload is applied
especially when rigidity is required.
A-65
●Bearing Internal Clearance and Preload
8.3.3 Preload and rigidity
The increased rigidity effect preloading has on bearings
is shown in Fig. 8.2.  When the offset inner rings of the
two paired angular contact ball bearings are pressed
together, each inner ring is displaced axially by the
amount δ0 and is thus given a preload, F0, in the
direction. Under this condition, when external axial load
Fa is applied, bearing!will have an increased
displacement by the amount δa and bearing @,s
displacement will decrease. At this time the loads applied
to bearing!and @ are FI and FII, respectively.
Under the condition of no preload, bearing I will be
displaced by the amount δb when axial load Fa is
applied. Since the amount of displacement, δa, is less
than δb, it indicates a higher rigidity for δa.

●Allowable Speed
As bearing speed increases, the temperature of the
bearing also increases due to friction heat generated in
the bearing interior. If the temperature continues to rise
and exceeds certain limits, the efficiency of the lubricant
start to fail down drastically, and the bearing can no
longer continue to operate in a stable manner. Therefore,
the maximum speed at which it is possible for the bearing
to continuously operate without the generation of
excessive heat beyond specified limits, is called the
allowable speed (r/min).
The allowable speed of a bearing depends on the type
of bearing, bearing dimensions, type of cage, load,
lubricating conditions, and cooling conditions.
The allowable speeds listed in the bearing tables for
grease and oil lubrication are for standard NTN bearings
under normal operating conditions, correctly installed,
using the suitable lubricants with adequate supply and
proper maintenance.  Moreover, these values are based
on normal load conditions (P ≦0.09C, Fa / Fr≦0.3). For
ball bearings with contact seals (LLU type), the allowable
speed is determined by the peripheral lip speed of the
seal.
For bearings to be used under heavier than normal load
conditions, the allowable speed values listed in the
bearing tables must be multiplied by an adjustment factor.
The adjustment factors f L and f C are given in Figs. 9.1
and 9.2.
Also, when radial bearings are mounted on vertical
shafts, lubricant retentions and cage guidance are not
favorable compared to horizontal shaft mounting.
Therefore, the allowable speed should be reduced to
approximately 80% of the listed speed.
For speeds other than those mentioned above, and for
which data is incomplete, please consult NTN
Engineering.
It is possible to operate precision bearings with high
speed specification cages at speeds higher than those
listed in the bearing tables, if special precautions are
taken. These precautions should include the use of forced
oil circulation methods such as oil jet or oil mist
lubrication.
Under such high speed operating conditions, when
special care is taken, the standard allowable speeds
given in the bearing tables can be adjusted upward. The
maximum speed adjustment values, f B, by which the
bearing table speeds can be multiplied, are shown in
Table 9.1. However, for any application requiring speeds
in excess of the standard allowable speed, please consult
NTN Engineering.

●Friction and Temperature Rise
10.1  Friction
One of the main functions required of a bearing is that
it must have low friction. Under normal operating
conditions rolling bearings have a much smaller friction
coefficient than the slide bearings, especially starting
friction.
The friction coefficient for rolling bearings is calculated
on the basis of the bearing bore diameters and is
expressed by formula (10.1).
μ＝
2M
…………………………………… (10.1)
Pd
where,
μ：Friction coefficient
M：Friction moment, Nmm
P ：Load, N
d ：Bearing bore diameter, mm
Although the dynamic friction coefficient for rolling
bearings varies with the type of bearings, load,
lubrication, speed, and other factors; for normal operating
conditions, the approximate friction coefficients for
various bearing types are listed in Table 10.1.
10.2  Temperature rise
Almost all friction loss in a bearing is transformed into
heat within the bearing itself and causes the temperature
of the bearing to rise. The amount of thermal generation
caused by friction moment can be calculated using
formula (10.2).
Q＝0.105×10
-6Mn N
｝……………… (10.2)
＝1.03×10
-6Mn｛kgf｝
where,
Q：Thermal value, kW
M：Friction moment, N・mm
n：Rotational speed, r/min
Bearing operating temperature is determined by the
equilibrium or balance between the amount of heat
generated by the bearing and the amount of heat
conducted away from the bearing.  In most cases the
temperature rises sharply during initial operation, then
increases slowly until it reaches a stable condition and
then remains constant. The time it takes to reach this
stable state will vary according to the amount of heat
generated, the heat absorbing capacity of the housing
and surrounding parts, the amount of cooling surface,
amount of lubricating oil, and the surrounding ambient
temperature. If the temperature continues to rise and
does not become constant, it must be assumed that there
is some improper function.
Excessive bearing heat can be caused by: moment
load, insufficient internal clearance, excessive preload,
too little or too much lubricant, foreign matter in the
bearing, or by heat generated at the sealing device.

●Lubrication
11. Lubrication
11.1  Lubrication of rolling bearings 
The purpose of bearing lubrication is to prevent direct
metallic contact between the various rolling and sliding
elements. This is accomplished through the formation of a
thin oil (or grease) film on the contact surfaces.  However,
for rolling bearings, lubrication has the following
advantages:
(1) Friction and wear reduction
(2) Friction heat dissipation
(3) Prolonged bearing life
(4) Prevention of rust
(5) Protection against harmful elements
In order to achieve the above effects, the most effective
lubrication method for the operating conditions must be
selected. Also, a good quality, reliable lubricant must be
selected. In addition, an effectively designed sealing
system that prevents the intrusion of damaging elements

(dust, water, etc.) into the bearing interior, removes dust
and other impurities from the lubricant, and prevents the
lubricant from leaking to the outside, is also a
requirement.
Almost all rolling bearings use either grease or oil
lubrication methods, but in some special applications, a
solid lubricant such as molybdenum disulfide or graphite
may be used.
Fig. 11.1 shows the relationship between oil volume,
friction loss, and bearing temperature.  Table 11.1 details
the characteristics of this relationship.
11.2 Lubrication methods and characteristics
The lubrication methods come in two general
methods: you must be care for select of that from using
condition.
The characteristic are show in table 11.2.
Table 11.1  Oil volume, friction loss, bearing temperature 
(See Fig. 11.1)
Range
Characteristics
Lubrication method
When oil volume is extremely low,
direct metallic contact occurs in places
between the rolling elements and
raceway surfaces. Bearing abrasion
and seizing occur.
A thin oil film develops over all
surfaces, friction is minimal and
bearing temperature is low.
As oil volume increases, heat buildup
is balanced by cooling.
Regardless of oil volume, temperature
increases at a fixed rate.
As oil volume increases, cooling
predominates and bearing temperature
decreases.

Table 11.2  Comparison of grease lubrication and
oil lubrication characteristics
11.3  Grease lubrication
Grease type lubricants are relatively easy to handle and
require only the simplest sealing devices-for these
reasons, grease is the most widely used lubricant for
rolling bearings.
11.3.1  Types and characteristics of grease
Lubricating grease are composed of either a mineral oil
base or a synthetic oil base. To this base a thickener and
other additives are added. The properties of all greases
are mainly determined by the kind of base oil used and by
the combination of thickening agent and various
additives.
Standard greases and their characteristics are listed in
Table 11.3. As performance characteristics of even the
same type of grease will vary widely from brand to brand,
it is best to check the manufacturers' data when
selecting a grease.

●Lubrication
(5)  Mixing of greases
When greases of different kinds are mixed together, the
consistency of the greases will change (usually softer), the
operating temperature range will be lowered, and other
changes in characteristics will occur. As a general rule,
greases with different bases oil, and greases with different
thickener agents should never be mixed.
Also, greases of different brands should not be mixed
because of the different additives they contain.
However, if different greases must be mixed, at least
greases with the same base oil and thickening agent
should be selected. But even when greases of the same
base oil and thickening agent are mixed, the quality of the
grease may still change due to the difference in additives.
For this reason, changes in consistency and other qualities
should be checked before being applied.
11.3.2  Amount of grease
The amount of grease used in any given situation will
depend on many factors relating to the size and shape of
the housing, space limitations, bearing's rotating speed
and type of grease used.
As a general rule, housings and bearings should be
only filled from 30% to 60% of their capacities.
Where speeds are high and temperature rises need to
be kept to a minimum, a reduced amount of grease
should be used. Excessive amount of grease cause
temperature rise which in turn causes the grease to
soften and may allow leakage. With excessive grease fills
oxidation and deterioration may cause lubricating
efficiency to be lowered.
Moreover, the standard bearing space can be found by
formula (11.1)
V＝K・W ……………………………… (11.1)
where, 
V : Quantity of bearing space open type (approx.)  cm3
K : Bearing space factor (Table 11.5)
W: Mass of bearing  kg
A-72
(1)  Base oil
Natural mineral oil or synthetic oils such as diester oil,
silicone oil and fluorocarbon oil are used as grease base
oils.
Mainly, the properties of any grease is determined by
the properties of the base oil. Generally, greases with a
low viscosity base oil are best suited for low temperatures
and high speeds; while greases made from high viscosity
base oils are best suited for heavy loads.
(2)  Thickening agents
Thickening agents are compounded with base oils to
maintain the semi-solid state of the grease.  Thickening
agents consist of two types of bases, metallic soaps and
non-soaps.  Metallic soap thickeners include: lithium,
sodium, calcium, etc.
Non-soap base thickeners are divided into two groups;
inorganic (silica gel, bentonite, etc.) and organic (poly-
urea, fluorocarbon, etc.).
The various special characteristics of a grease, such as
limiting temperature range, mechanical stability, water
resistance, etc. depend largely on the type of thickening
agent used. For example, a sodium based grease is
generally poor in water resistance properties, while
greases with bentone, poly-urea and other non-metallic
soaps as the thickening agent are generally superior in
high temperature properties.
(3)  Additives
Various additives are added to greases to improve
various properties and efficiency. For example, there are
anti-oxidents, high-pressure additives (EP additives), rust
preventives, and anti-corrosives.
For bearings subject to heavy loads and/or shock loads,
a grease containing high-pressure additives should be
used. For comparatively high operating temperatures or
in applications where the grease cannot be replenished
for long periods, a grease with an oxidation stabilizer is
best to use.
(4)  Consistency
The consistency of a grease, i.e. the stiffness and
liquidity, is expressed by a numerical index.
The NLGI values for this index indicate the relative
softness of the grease; the larger the number, the stiffer
the grease.  The consistency of a grease is determined
by the amount of thickening agent used and the viscosity
of the base oil. For the lubrication of rolling bearings,
greases with the NLGI consistency numbers of 1, 2, and
3 are used.
General relationships between consistency and
application of grease are shown in Table 11.4.

supply interval should be shortened accordingly.
Generally, for every 10˚C increase in bearing
temperature above 80˚C, the relubrication period is
reduced by exponent "1/1.5".
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
(Example)
Find the grease relubrication time limit for deep
groove ball bearing 6206, with a radial load of
2.0 kN operating at 3,600 r/min.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
Cr / Pr ＝19.5/2.0 kN ＝9.8, from Fig. 9.1 the adjusted
load, fL, is 0.96.
From the bearing tables, the allowable speed for
bearing 6206 is 11,000 r/min and the numbers of
revolutions permissible at a radial load of 2.0 kN are
no ＝0.96×11,000 ＝10,560 r/min
therefore,   no ＝10,560 ＝2.93
n       3,600
Using the chart in Fig. 11.2, find the point corresponding
to bore diameter d = 30 (from bearing table) on the
vertical line for radial ball bearings. Draw a straight
horizontal line to vertical line !. Then, draw a straight line
from that point (A in example) to the point on line@ which
corresponds to the no / n value (2.93 in example). The
point, C, where this line intersects vertical line # indicates
the relubrication interval h. In this case the life of the
grease is approximately 5,500 hours.
11.3.3   Replenishment
As the lubricating efficiency of grease declines with the
passage of time, fresh grease must be re-supplied at
proper intervals. The replenishment time interval depends
on the type of bearing, dimensions, bearing's rotating
speed, bearing temperature, and type of grease.
An easy reference chart for calculating grease
replenishment intervals is shown in Fig. 11.2.
This chart indicates the replenishment interval for
standard rolling bearing grease when used under normal
operating conditions.
As operating temperatures increase, the grease re-

●Lubrication
11.4 Solid grease (For bearings with solid grease)
"Solid grease" is a lubricant composed mainly of
lubricating grease and ultra-high polymer polyethylene.
Solid grease has the same viscosity as grease at normal
temperature, but by applying a special heat treatment
process, this special grease solidifies retaining a large
proportion of the lubricant within the bearing. The result of
this solidification is that the grease does not easily leak
from the bearing, even when the bearing is subjected to
strong vibrations or centrifugal force. 
Bearings with solid grease are available in two types:
the spot-pack type in which solid grease is injected into
the retainer, and the full-pack type in which all empty
space around the rolling elements is filled with solid
grease. 
Spot-pack solid grease is standard for deep groove ball
bearings, small diameter ball bearings, and bearing units.
Full-pack solid grease is standard for self-aligning ball
bearings, spherical roller bearings, and needle roller
bearings. 
Primary advantages:
(1) Clean working environment with minimal grease
leakage
(2) Low bearing torque with spot-pack type solid grease
For more details, please refer to NTN special catalog
of Solid grease bearings.

11.5 Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication is suitable for applications requiring that
bearing-generated heat or heat applied to the bearing
from other sources be carried away from the bearing and
dissipated to the outside.Table 11.6 shows the main
methods of oil lubrication.
11.5.1 Selection of lubricating oil
Under normal operating conditions, spindle oil, machine
oil, turbine oil, and other mineral oils are widely used for
the lubrication of rolling bearings. However, for
temperatures above 150˚C or below -30˚C, synthetic oils
such as diester oil, silicone oil, and fluorocarbon oil are
used.
For lubricating oils, viscosity is one of the most
important properties and determines an oil’s lubricating
efficiency. If viscosity is too low, formation of the oil film
will be insufficient, and damage will occur to the load
carrying surfaces of the bearing. If viscosity is too high,
viscous resistance will also be great and result in
temperature increases and friction loss. In general, for
higher speed applications a lower viscosity oil should be
used; for heavier load applications, a higher viscosity oil
should be used. 
In regard to operating temperature and lubrication,
Table 11.7 lists the required oil viscosity for different
types of rolling bearings. Fig. 11.5 is an oil viscosity -
operating temperature comparison chart for the purpose
of selecting a lubrication oil with viscosity characteristics
appropriate to an application. 
Table 11.8 lists the selection standards for lubricating oil
viscosity with reference to bearing operating conditions.

●Lubrication
Lubrication method
Example
¡In this method, the 
required minimum 
amount of lubricating oil 
is measured and fed to 
each bearing at ideal 
intervals using 
compressed air. 
¡With fresh lubricating oil 
constantly being fed to 
the bearing, and with 
the cooling effect of the 
compressed air, bearing 
temperature rise can be 
minimized. 
¡Because the required oil 
quantity is infinitesimal, 
the working environment 
can be kept clean.
　Air-oil lubrication units 
are available from NTN.
Lubrication method
Example
(Air-oil lubrication)
¡This method lubricates 
by injecting oil under 
high pressure directly 
into the side of the 
bearing. This is a 
reliable system for high 
speed, high temperature 
or otherwise severe 
conditions.
¡Used for lubricating the 
bearings in jet engines, 
gas turbines, and other 
high speed equipment. 
¡Under-race lubrication 
for machine tools is one 
example of this type of 
lubrication.
(Oil jet lubrication)
¡Using pressurized air, 
lubricating oil is 
atomized before passing 
through the bearing. 
¡Due to the low lubricant 
resistance, this method 
is well suited to high 
speed applications.
 (Oil mist lubrication)
¡In this method, a 
partially submerged disc 
rotates and pulls oil up 
into a reservoir from 
which it then drains 
down through the 
bearing, lubricating it.
 (Disc lubrication)
¡In this method, oil is 
collected above the 
bearing and allowed to 
drip down into the 
housing where it 
becomes a lubricating 
mist as it strikes the 
rolling elements. 
Another version allows 
only slight amounts of 
oil to pass through the 
bearing. 
¡Used at relatively high 
speeds for light to 
moderate load 
applications. 
¡In most cases, oil 
volume is a few drops 
per minute.
(Drip lubrication)
¡Used for bearing cooling 
applications or for 
automatic oil supply 
systems in which the oil 
supply is centrally 
located. 
¡One of the advantages 
of this method is that oil 
cooling devices and 
filters to maintain oil 
purity can be installed 
within the system. 
¡In order for oil to 
thoroughly lubricate the 
bearing, oil inlets and 
outlets must be provided 
on opposite sides of the 
bearing.
 (Circulating lubrication)
¡In this method, an 
impeller or similar 
device mounted on the 
shaft draws up oil and 
sprays it onto the 
bearing. This method 
can be used at 
considerably high 
speeds.
(Oil spray lubrication)
¡Oil bath lubrication is 
the most generally used 
method of lubrication 
and is widely used for 
low to moderate rotation 
speed applications.
¡For horizontal shaft 
applications, oil level 
should be maintained at 
approximately the 
center of the lowest 
rolling element, 
according to the oil 
gauge, when the 
bearing is at rest. For 
vertical shafts at low 
speeds, oil level should 
be maintained at 50 - 80% 
submergence of the 
rolling elements.

11.5.2 Oil quantity
In forced oil lubrication systems, the heat radiated away
by the housing and surrounding parts plus the heat
carried away by the lubricating oil is approximately equal
to the amount of heat generated by the bearing and other
sources. 
For standard housing applications, the quantity of oil
required can be found by formula (11.2).
Q＝K・q ……………………………… (11.2)
where, 
Q: Quantity of oil for one bearing cm3/min.
K: Allowable oil temperature rise factor (Table 11.9)
q: Minimum oil quantity cm3/min. (Fig. 11.6)
Because the amount of heat radiated will vary
according to the type of housing, for actual operation it is
advisable that the quantity of oil calculated by formula
(11.2) be multiplied by a factor or 1.5 or 2.0. Then, the
amount of oil can be adjusted to correspond to actual
operating conditions. 
Furthermore, if it is assumed for calculation purposes
that no heat is radiated by the housing, and that all
bearing heat is removed by the oil, then the value in Fig.
11.3 for shaft diameter, d ＝0, regardless of actual shaft
diameter.

11.5.3 Relubrication intervals
The intervals at which lubricating oil should be changed
varies depending upon operating conditions, oil quantity,
and type of oil used. In general, for oil bath lubrication
where the operating temperature is 50˚C or less, oil
should be replaced once a year. When the operating
temperature is between 80˚C – 100˚C, oil should be
replaced at least every three months. For important
equipment, it is advisable that lubricating efficiency and
oil purity deterioration be checked regularly to determine
when oil replacement is necessary.

External seals have two main functions: to prevent
lubricating oil from leaking out, and, to prevent dust, water,
and other contaminants from entering the bearing. When
selecting a seal, the following factors need to be taken into
consideration: the type of lubricant (oil or grease), seal
peripheral speed, shaft fitting errors, space limitations,
seal friction and resultant heat increase, and cost. 
Sealing devices for rolling bearings fall into two main
classifications: non-contact seals and contact seals.
¡Non-contact seals: Non-contact seals utilize a small
clearance between the shaft and the housing cover.
Therefore friction is negligible, making them suitable for
high speed applications. 
In order to improve sealing capability, clearance
spaces are often filled with lubricant.
¡Contact seals: Contact seals accomplish their sealing
action through the contact pressure of a resilient part of
the seal (the lip is often made of synthetic rubber) and
the sealing surface. Contact seals are generally far
superior to non-contact seals in sealing efficiency,
although their friction torque and temperature rise
coefficients are higher. Furthermore, because the lip
portion of a contact seal rotates while in contact with
the shaft, the allowable seal peripheral speed varies
depending on seal type. 
Lubrication is necessary at the contact surface
between the lip portion of the contact seal and the
shaft. Ordinary bearing lubricant can also be used for
this purpose. 
The following chart lists the special characteristics of
seals and other points to be considered when choosing
an appropriate seal.

provided on the housing inner 
diameter to greatly improve the 
sealing effect. When the grooves 
are filled with lubricant, the 
intrusion of contaminants from the 
outside is prevented.  Oil grooves are provided on both 
the shaft outer diameter and 
housing inner diameter for a seal 
with even greater sealing 
efficiency.
・In order to improve sealing 
efficiency, clearances between the

minimized. However, care should 
be taken to confirm shaft/bearing 
rigidity and other factors to avoid 
direct shaft-housing contact during 
operation.

In this design, lubricating oil that 
makes its way out of the housing 
along the shaft is thrown off by 
projections on the oil comb sleeve 
and recirculated.    By providing a slinger inside the 
housing, centrifugal force guides 
the lubricant flow back on the 
bearing and helps prevent it from 
dirtying the work environment.    By mounting a slinger on the outside 
of the housing, centrifugal force 
helps to prevent dust and other solid 
contaminants from entering.

Oil seal
Oil seals are widely used, and their 
shapes and dimensions are 
standardized under JIS B 2402. 
In this design, a ring-shaped spring 
is installed in the lip section. As a 
result, optimal contact pressure is 
exerted between the lip edge and 
shaft surface, and sealing 
efficiency is good. 
When the oil seal and the bearing 
are in very close proximity, internal 
bearing clearances are sometimes 
too small to accommodate the 
additional heat generated by 
friction between the seal and shaft. 
In addition to considering the heat 
generated by contact seals at 
various peripheral speeds, internal 
bearing clearances must also be 
selected with caution. 
Depending upon the direction in 
which the lip faces (in toward the 
bearing or away from the bearing) 
contact oil seals are very effective 
at preventing lubricant leakage 
from the housing or contaminants 
from infiltrating the bearing.

13.1 Raceway and rolling element materials
While the contact surfaces of a bearing's raceways and
rolling elements are subjected to repeated heavy stress,
they still must maintain high precision and rotational
accuracy. To accomplish this, the raceways and rolling
elements must be made of a material that has high
hardness, is resistant to rolling fatigue, is wear resistant,
and has good dimensional stability. The most common
cause of fatigue cracking in bearings is the inclusion of
non-metallic impurities in the steel. By using pure
materials low in these non-metallic impurities, the rolling
fatigue life of the bearing is lengthened. 
For all NTN bearings, steel low in oxygen content and
non-metallic impurities, then refined by a vacuum
degassing process as well as outside hearth smelting, is
used. For bearings requiring especially high reliability and
long life, steels of even higher in purity, such as vacuum
smelted steel (VIM, VAR, CEVM) and electro-slag melted
steel (ESR), are used.
1) High/mid carbon alloy steel
In general, steel varieties which can be hardened not
just on the surface but also deep hardened by the so-
called "through hardening method" are used for the
raceways and rolling elements of bearings. Foremost
among these is high carbon chromium bearing steel,
which is widely used. For large type bearings and
bearings with large cross sectional dimensions, induction
hardened bearing steel incorporating manganese or
molybdenum is used. Also in use is mid-carbon chromium
steel incorporating silicone and manganese, which gives
it hardening properties comparable to high carbon
chromium steel.
2) Case hardened (carburized) steel
Because of its combination of a hard surface layer
which has been carburized and hardened to an
appropriate depth, and a relatively pliable inner core,
case hardened steel has excellent efficiency against
shock loads. NTN uses case hardened steel for almost all
of its tapered roller bearings. In terms of case hardened
steel for NTN's other bearings, chromium steel and
chrome molybdenum steel are used for small to medium
sized bearings, and nickel chrome molybdenum steel is
used for large sized bearings. 
3) Heat resistant bearing steel
When bearings made of ordinary high carbon chromium
steel which have undergone standard heat treatment are
used at temperatures above 120˚C for long durations,
unacceptably large dimensional changes can occur. For
this reason, a dimension stabilizing treatment (TS
treatment) has been devised for very high temperature
applications. Through application of this dimension
stabilizing treatment, shortening of rolling fatigue life due
to decreases in bearing hardness at high temperatures
can be avoided. (refer to page insert A-17 3.4.2)
For standard high temperature bearings used at
temperatures from 150˚C – 200˚C, the addition of silicone
to the steel improves heat resistance and results in a
bearing with excellent rolling fatigue life with minimal
dimensional change or softening at high temperatures. 
A variety of heat resistant steels are also incorporated in
bearings to minimize softening and dimensional changes
when used at high temperatures. Two of these are high
speed molybdenum steel and high speed tungsten steel.
For bearings requiring heat resistance in high speed
applications, there is also heat resistant case hardening
molybdenum steel. 
4) Corrosion resistant bearing steel
For applications requiring high corrosion resistance,
stainless steel is used. To achieve this corrosion
resistance a large proportion of the alloying element
chrome is added to martensite stainless steel. 
5) Induction hardened steel
Besides the use of surface hardening steel, induction
hardening is also utilized for bearing raceway surfaces,
and for this purpose mid-carbon steel is used for its lower
carbon content instead of through hardened steel. For
induction hardening of the deep layers required for larger
bearings and bearings with large surface dimensions,
mid-carbon steel is fortified with chrome and molybdenum.
6) Other bearing materials
For ultra high speed applications and applications
requiring very high level corrosion resistance, ceramic
bearing materials such as Si3N4 are also available.

●Bearing Materials
13.2 Cage materials
Bearing cage materials must have the strength to
withstand rotational vibrations and shock loads. These
materials must also have a low friction coefficient, be light
weight, and be able to withstand bearing operation
temperatures. 
For small and medium sized bearings, pressed cages of
cold or hot rolled steel with a low carbon content of
approx. 0.1% are used. However, depending on the
application, austenitic stainless steel is also used. 
For large bearings, machined cages of machine
structural carbon steel or high tensile cast brass are
widely used, although aluminum alloy and other material
cages are also available. 
For aircraft engine bearings, high tensile brass, mid-
carbon nickel, chrome, or molybdenum steel is used after
undergoing various heat treatments and high
temperature tempering. The sliding properties of these
materials may also be enhanced when silver plated. 
Injection molded plastic cages are now widely used:
most are made from fiber glass reinforced heat resistant
polyimide resin. Plastic cages are light weight, corrosion
resistant and have excellent damping and sliding
properties. Heat resistant polyimide resins now
enable the production of cages that perform well in
applications ranging between -40˚C – 120˚C. However,
they are not recommended for use at temperatures
exceeding 120˚C.

Depending upon the design of a shaft or housing, the
shaft may be influenced by an unbalanced load or other
factors which can then cause large fluctuations in bearing
efficiency. For this reason, it is necessary to keep the
following points in mind when designing or choosing the
design for shafts and housings.
1) Bearing arrangement selection; most effective fixing
method for bearing arrangement
2) Suitable shaft and housing fillet radius and abutment
height dimensions
3) Dimensions of fitted surfaces; shape accuracy and
abutment squareness
4) Allowable bearing misalignment; finishing precision
and installation error of shaft and housing suitable
for allowable alignment angle
A-83
●Shaft and Housing Design
Inner ring clamp
Outer ring clamp
Snap ring
The most common method of fixing bearings in place is to use 
clamping nuts or bolts to hold the bearing or housing abutment 
against the ring end face.
Use of snap rings regulated under JIS B 2804, B 2805, and B 2806, 
makes construction very simple. However, interference with 
chamfers, bearing installation dimensions, and other related 
specifications must be considered carefully. 
Snap rings are not suitable for applications requiring high accuracy 
and where the snap ring receives large axial loads.
Adapter sleeve mounting
Withdrawal sleeve mounting
Split ring mounting
When installing bearings on cylindrical shafts, adapter sleeves or 
withdrawal sleeves can be used to fix bearings in place axially. 
Fixing the bearing axially in this way depends upon friction between 
the sleeve and shaft.
For installation of tapered bore bearings directly on tapered shafts, 
the bearing is held in place by a split ring inserted into a groove on 
the shaft, and is fixed in place by a split ring nut or screw.
Table 14.2  Fixing methods for bearings with tapered bores
Table 14.1  General bearing fixing methods
14.1  Fixing of bearings
When fixing a bearing in position on a shaft or housing,
there are many instances where the interference fit alone
is not enough to hold the bearing in place. Bearings must
be fixed in place by various methods so that they do not
move axially when placed under load. 
Moreover, even bearings which are not subjected to
axial loads (such as cylindrical roller bearings, etc.), must
be fixed in place axially because of the potential for ring
displacement due to momentary loads and resulting shaft
flexure which may cause damage.
Table 14.1 shows general bearing fixing methods, and
Table 14.2 shows fixing methods for bearings with
tapered bores.

Note: ras max maximum allowable fillet radius.
14.2  Bearing fitting dimensions
14.2.1 Abutment height and fillet radius
The shaft and housing abutment height (h) should be
larger than the bearings' maximum allowable chamfer
dimensions (rs max), and the abutment should be
designed so that it directly contacts the flat part of the
bearing end face. The fillet radius must be smaller than
the bearing's minimum allowable chamfer dimension (rs
min) so that it does not interfere with bearing seating.
Table 14.3 lists abutment height (h) and fillet radius (ra). 
For bearings to be applied to very large axial loads as
well, shaft abutments (h) should be higher than the values
in the table.
14.2.2 For spacer and ground undercut
In cases where a fillet radius (ra) larger than the bearing
chamfer dimension is required to strengthen the shaft or
to relieve stress concentration (Fig. 14.1a), or where the
shaft abutment height is too low to afford adequate
contact surface with the bearing (Fig. 14.1b), spacers
may be used effectively.
Relief dimensions for ground shaft and housing fitting
surfaces are given in Table 14.4.

14.2.3 Thrust bearings and relief dimensions
For thrust bearings, it is necessary to make the raceway
back face sufficiently broad in relation to load and rigidity,
and relief dimensions from the dimension tables should
be adopted. (Figs. 14.2 and 14.3)
For this reason, shaft and abutment heights will be
larger than for radial bearings. (Refer to dimension tables
for all thrust bearing relief dimensions.)

bearings with aligning properties are advisable. Although
allowable misalignment will vary according to bearing
type, load conditions, internal clearances, etc., Table
14.6 lists some general misalignment standards for
normal applications. In order to avoid reduced wear life
and cage abrasion, it is necessary to maintain levels of
misalignment below these standard levels.

●Bearing Handling
15.2.1  Installation preparations
Bearings should be fitted in a clean, dry work area.
Especially for small and miniature bearings, a "clean
room" should be provided as any contamination particles
in the bearing will greatly affect bearing efficiency. 
Before installation, all fitting tools, shafts, housings, and
related parts should be cleaned and any burrs or cutting
chips removed if necessary. Shaft and housing fitting
surfaces should also be checked for roughness,
dimensional and design accuracy, and to ensure that they
are within allowable tolerance limits. 
Bearings should not be unwrapped until just prior to
installation. Normally, bearings to be used with grease
lubricant can be installed as is, without removing the rust
preventative. However, for bearings which will use oil
lubricant, or in cases where mixing the grease and rust
preventative would result in loss of lubrication efficiency,
the rust preventative should be removed by washing with
benzene or petroleum solvent and dried before
installation. Bearings should also be washed and dried
before installation if the package has been damaged or
there are other chances that the bearings have been
contaminated. Double shielded bearings and sealed
bearings should never be washed.
15.2.2  Installing cylindrical bore bearings
Bearings with relatively small interference fits can be
press fit at room temperature by using a sleeve against
the inner ring face as shown in Fig. 15.3. Usually,
bearings are installed by striking the sleeve with a
hammer; however, when installing a large number of
bearings, a mechanical or hydraulic press should be used. 
When installing non-separable bearings on a shaft and
in a housing simultaneously, a pad which distributes the
fitting pressure evenly over the inner and outer rings is
used as shown in Fig. 15.4. When fitting bearings which
have a large inner ring interference fit, or when fitting
bearings on shafts that have a large diameter, a
considerable amount of force is required to install the
bearing at room temperature. Installation can be
facilitated by heating and expanding the inner ring
beforehand. The required relative temperature difference
between the inner ring and the fitting surface depends on
the amount of interference and the shaft fitting surface
diameter. FIg. 15.5 shows the relation between the
bearing inner bore diameter temperature differential and 
15.  Bearing Handling
Bearings are precision parts and, in order to preserve
their accuracy and reliability, care must be exercised in
their handling.
In particular, bearing cleanliness must be maintained,
sharp impacts avoided, and rust prevented.
15.1 Bearing storage
Most rolling bearings are coated with a rust preventative
before being packed and shipped, and they should be
stored at room temperature with a relative humidity of
less than 60%.

When bearings are being installed on shafts or in
housings, the bearing rings should never be struck
directly with a hammer or a drift, as shown in Fig.
15.1, because damage to the bearing may result.
Any force applied to the bearing should always be
evenly distributed over the entire bearing ring
face. Also, when fitting both rings simultaneously,
applying pressure to one ring only, as shown in Fig.
15.2, should be avoided because indentations in the
raceway surface may be caused by the rolling
elements, or other internal damage may result.

the amount of thermal expansion. In any event, bearings
should never be heated above 120˚C.
The most commonly used method of heating bearings is
to immerse them in hot oil. However, this method should
not be used for prelubricated shielded and sealed bearings. 
To avoid overheating parts of the bearings they should
never be brought into direct contact with the heat source,
but instead should be suspended inside the heating tank
or placed on a wire grid.
If bearings are dry-heated with a heating cabinet or hot
plate, they can be mounted without drying.  
For heating the inner rings of Nu, NJ or NUP cylindrical
and similar type bearings without any ribs or with only a
single rib, an induction heater can be used to quickly heat
bearings in a dry state (always demagnetize). 
When heated bearings are installed on shafts, the
inner rings must be held against the shaft abutment
until the bearing has been cooled in order to prevent
gaps from occurring between the ring and the
abutment face. 
As shown in Fig. 15.6, a removal pawl, or tool, can also
be used to dismount the inner ring when using the
induction heating method described above.
15.2.3 Installation of tapered bore bearings
Small type bearings with tapered bores are installed
over a tapered shaft, withdrawal sleeves, or adapter
sleeves by driving the bearing into place using a locknut.
The locknut is tightened using a hammer or impact
wrench. (Fig. 15.7)
Large size bearings require considerable fitting force
and must be installed hydraulically. 
In Fig. 15.8 the fitting surface friction and nut tightening

torque needed to install bearings with tapered bores
directly onto tapered shafts are decreased by injecting
high pressure oil between the fitting surfaces.
Fig. 15.9 a) shows one method of installation where a
hydraulic nut is used to drive the bearing onto a tapered
shaft. 
Fig. 15.9 b) and c) show installation using a hydraulic
nut with adapter sleeves and withdrawal sleeves. 
Fig. 15.10 shows an installation method using a
hydraulic withdrawal sleeve.
With tapered bore bearings, as the inner ring is driven
axially onto the shaft or adapter or withdrawal sleeve, the
interference will increase and the bearing internal radial
clearance will decrease. The amount of interference can
be estimated by measuring the amount or radial
clearance decrease. As shown in Fig. 15.11, the internal
radial clearance between the rollers and outer ring of
spherical roller bearings should be measured with a
thickness gauge under no load while the rollers are held
in the correct position. The measured clearance should
be the same for both rows. Instead of using the decrease
in amount of internal radial clearance to estimate the
interference, it is possible to estimate by measuring the
distance the bearing has been driven onto the shaft. 
For spherical roller bearings, Table 15.1 indicates the
appropriate interference which will be achieved as a
result of the internal radial clearance decrease, or the
distance the bearing has been driven onto the shaft. 
For conditions such as heavy loads, high speeds, or
when there is a large temperature differential between the
inner and outer rings, etc. which necessitate large

interference fits, bearings which have a minimum internal
radial clearance of C3 or greater should be used. Table
15.1 lists the maximum values for internal radial clearance
decrease and axial displacement. For these applications,
the remaining clearance must be greater than the
minimum remaining clearance listed in Table 15.1.
15.2.4 Installation of outer ring
Even for tight interference fits, the outer rings of small
type bearings can be installed by driving them into
housings at room temperature. For large type bearings,
the housing can be heated before installing the bearing,
or the bearing's outer ring can be cooled with dry ice, etc.
before installing. If dry ice or other cooling agent is used,
atmospheric moisture will condense on bearing surfaces,
and therefore appropriate rust preventative measures are
necessary.
15.3 Internal clearance adjustment
As shown in Fig. 15.12, for angular contact ball
bearings and tapered roller bearings the desired amount
of axial internal clearance can be set at the time of
installation by tightening or loosening the adjustment nut. 
To adjust the suitable axial internal clearance or amount
of bearing preload, the internal clearance can be
measured while tightening the adjusting nut as shown in
Fig. 15.13. Other methods are to check rotation torque by
rotating the shaft or housing while adjusting the nut, or to
insert shims of the proper thickness as shown in Fig.
15.14.

●Bearing Handling
15.4 Post installation running test
To insure that the bearing has been properly installed, a
running test is performed after installation is completed.
The shaft or housing is first rotated by hand and if no
problems are observed a low speed, no load power test is
performed. If no abnormalities are observed, the load
and speed are gradually increased to operating
conditions. During the test if any unusual noise,
vibration, or temperature rise is observed the test should
be stopped and the equipment examined. If necessary,
the bearing should be disassembled for inspection. 
To check bearing running noise, the sound can be
amplified and the type of noise ascertained with a
listening instrument placed against the housing. A clear,
smooth and continuous running sound is normal. A high,
metallic or irregular sound indicates some error in
function. Vibration can be accurately checked with a
vibration measuring instrument, and the amplitude and
frequency characteristics measured against a fixed
standard. 
Usually the bearing temperature can be estimated from
the housing surface temperature. However, if the bearing
outer ring is accessible through oil inlets, etc., the
temperature can be more accurately measured.
Under normal conditions, bearing temperature rises
with rotation time and then reaches a stable operating
temperature after a certain period of time. If the
temperature does not level off and continues to rise, or if
there is a sudden temperature rise, or if the temperature
is unusually high, the bearing should be inspected.
15.5 Bearing disassembly
Bearings are often removed as part of periodic
inspection procedures or during the replacement of other
parts. However, the shaft and housing are almost always
reinstalled, and in more than a few cases the bearings
themselves are reused. These bearings, shafts, housings,
and other related parts must be designed to prevent
damage during disassembly procedures, and the proper
disassembly tools must be employed. When removing
inner and outer rings which have been installed with
interference fits, the dismounting force should be applied
to that ring only and not applied to other parts of the
bearing, as this may cause internal damage to the
bearing's raceway or rolling elements.
15.5.1  Disassembly of bearings with cylindrical bores
For small type bearings, the pullers shown in Fig. 15.15
a) and b) or the press method shown in Fig. 15.16 can be
used for disassembly. When used properly, these
methods can improve disassembly efficiency and prevent
damage to bearings. 
To facilitate disassembly procedures, attention should
be given to planning the designs of shafts and housings,
such as providing extraction grooves on the shaft and
housing for puller claws as shown Figs. 15.17 and 15.18.
Threaded bolt holes should also be provided in housings
to facilitate the pressing out of outer rings as shown in
Fig. 15.19.

Large bearings, installed with tight fits, and having been
in service for a long period of time, will likely have
developed fretting corrosion on fitted surfaces and will
require considerable dismounting force. In such
instances, dismounting friction can be reduced by
injecting oil under high pressure between the shaft and
inner ring surfaces as shown in Fig. 15.20. 
For NU, NJ and NUP type cylindrical roller bearings, the
induction heating method shown in Fig. 15.6 can also be
used for easier disassembly of the inner ring. This
method is highly efficient for frequent disassembly of
bearings with identical dimensions.
15.5.2 Disassembly of bearings with tapered bores
Small type bearings with adapters can be easily
disassembled by loosening the locknut and driving the
inner ring off with a metal block as shown in Fig. 15.21.
Bearings which have been installed with withdrawal
sleeves can be disassembled by tightening down the lock
nut as shown in Fig. 15.22. 
For large type bearings on tapered shafts, adapters, or
withdrawal sleeves, disassembly is greatly facilitated by
hydraulic methods. Fig. 15.23 shows one method of
hydraulic injection disassembly in which high pressure oil
is injected between the fitted surfaces of the tapered shaft
and bearing.

While it is of course impossible to directly observe
bearings in operation, one can get a good idea of how they
are operating by monitoring noise, vibration, temperature
and lubricant condition. Types of damage typically
encountered are presented in Table 16.1.

Table 17.4.1 lists equations for calculating the pressure
and maximum allowable stress between fitting surfaces. 
Table 17.4.2 can be used to determine the approximate
average groove diameter for bearing inner and outer
rings. 
The effective interference, in other words the actual
interference after fitting, is smaller than the apparent
interference derived from the measured valued for the
bearing bore diameter and shaft. This difference is due to
the roughness or variations of the finished surfaces to be
fitted, and therefore it is necessary to assume the
following reductions in effective interference:
For ground shafts: 1.0 ～2.5μm
For lathed shafts : 5.0 ～7.0μm

●Deep Groove Ball Bearings
1. Design features and special characteristics
Deep groove ball bearings are very widely used. A deep
groove is formed on each inner and outer ring of the bearing
enabling them to sustain radial and axial loads in either
direction as well as well as the complex loads which result
from the combination of these forces. Deep groove ball
bearings are suitable for high speed applications.
B-5
In addition to the open type, deep groove ball bearings
come in a number of varieties, including prelubricated
bearings, bearings with one or both sides sealed or shielded,
bearings with snap rings and high capacity specification, etc.
Table 1 shows the construction and special characteristics
of various sealed deep groove ball bearings.
Shielded type
Sealed type

Construction
¡Metal shield plate is 
affixed to outside ring; 
inner ring incorporates 
a V-groove and 
labyrinth clearance.
¡Outer ring incorporates 
synthetic rubber molded 
to a steel plate; seal 
edge is aligned with 
V-groove along inner 
ring surface with 
labyrinth clearance.
¡Basic construction the 
same as LU type, but 
specially designed lip 
on edge of seal 
prevents penetration by 
foreign matter; low 
torque construction.
¡Outer ring incorporates 
synthetic rubber molded 
to a steel plate; seal

●Deep Groove Ball Bearings
B-6
2. Standard cage types
As shown in Table 2, pressed cages are generally used in
deep groove ball bearings. However, machined cages are
also used in larger sized bearings designed for high speed
applications.
3. Other bearing types
3. 1  Bearings with snap rings
Some bearings accommodate a snap ring which is
attached along the outer diameter of the outer ring. By using
snap rings, positioning in the axial direction is possible and
housing installation is simplified. In addition to open type,
shielded and sealed types are also manufactured. Consult
NTN Engineering.
3. 2 Expansion compensating bearings
Expansion compensating bearings have the same boundary
dimensions as standard bearings, except that a high polymer
material with a large coefficient of thermal expansion has
been inserted along the outer circumference of the outer
ring.
Due to the extremely small difference of thermal expansion
attained between the fitted surfaces of the high polymer
equipped outer ring and the light alloy bearing housing, a
good interference fit can be achieved with stable
performance across a wide temperature range. Another
advantage is a large reduction in the occurrence of outer ring
creeping.
(1) Allowable load
Maximum allowable load Cp (refer to the table of boundary
dimensions) has been determined in accordance with outer
ring strength; therefore, it is necessary to select a  bearing
with a  maximum allowable load greater than the largest
anticipated bearing load.
(2) Housing and bearing fit
Table 3 shows the recommended fits for bearings with
light metal alloy housings.
In cases where the bearing is going to be interference fit
with the housing, it is very important not to damage the high
polymer material. Therefore it is essential that the lip of the
housing diameter be given a 10˚–15˚ chamfer as shown in
Diagram 2.
Furthermore, as shown in Diagram 2, it is also advisable to
apply the interference fit using a press in order not force the

(3) Radial internal clearance
Regulations for radial internal clearance are the same as
those for standard deep groove ball bearings. For standard
fit and application conditions, a C3 clearance is used with
this bearing.
For more detailed  information concerning this bearing and
the availability of roller bearings contact NTN Engineering.
3.3 TMB ball bearings
TMB ball bearings have the same boundary dimensions as
standard deep groove ball bearings, but have undergone a
special heat treatment that considerably extends wear life.
These bearings are especially effective in countering
reduced wear life due to the effects of infiltration by dust and
other foreign matter.
¡TMB ball bearings' special characteristics are identical to
standard bearings at rated loads, but with a bearing
characterization factor of a2 = 2.2
¡TMB 62 series bearings can be used in place of
standard 63 series bearings enabling lighter weight,
more compact designs
¡Greater resistance to reduced wear life due to infiltration
by dust and other foreign matter
For dimensional specifications and other detailed
information about TMB ball bearings, contact NTN
Engineering.
Diagram 3.  AC bearing
3.4 AC bearings (creep prevention bearings)
AC bearings have the same boundary dimensions as
standard bearings with the addition of two O-rings imbedded
in the outside circumference of the outer ring. (Diagram 3)
This bearing has a steel housing, can withstand rotating
outer ring loads, and is suitable for applications where a
"tight fit" is not possible but the fear of creeping exists. With
its capacity for axial load displacement, an AC bearing can
also be installed as a floating side bearing to accommodate
shaft fluctuations. Before installing the bearing into the
housing, high viscosity oil (base oil viscosity, 100 mm2/s or
more) or grease should be applied to the space between the
two O-rings. This lubricant forms a thin oil layer inside the
bearing which prevents contact between the outer ring and
housing, lowers the coefficient of friction, and is still able to
prevent creeping by utilizing the friction force of the O-rings.
For dimensional specifications, handling procedures, and
other detailed information concerning AC bearings, contact
NTN Engineering.

●Miniature and Extra Small Bearings
1. Design features and special characteristics
The dimensional range of miniature and extra small ball
bearings is given in Table 1. Boundary dimensions for both
metric and inch systems are in accordance with the
internationally specified ISO and ANSI/ABMA standards. The
most widely used sealed and shielded type ball bearings
have a 1–2 mm wider width dimension than open type
bearings.
The main variations of these bearings are shown in Table
2. Bearings with snap rings, which simplify the bearing
housing construction and design, have also been serialized
and are listed in dimension tables. Among the most generally
used sealed and shielded bearings are standard ZZ and ZZA
type which incorporate non-contact steel shield plates.
Diagram 1 also shows non-contact type rubber sealed LLB
and resin sealed SSA type bearings, and the contact-type
rubber sealed LLU bearing.

●Angular Contact Ball Bearings
1. Design features and special characteristics
1.1 Angular contact ball bearing
Angular contact ball bearings are non-separable type
bearings. The line connecting the contact points of the ball
and inner ring and the ball and outer ring creates an angle
with the line drawn in the radial direction called the contact
angle.
In addition to radial loads, single direction axial loads can
also be accommodated by angular contact ball bearings.
Furthermore, since an axial load is generated from a radial
force, these bearings are generally used in pairs facing each
other. Standard type, high speed use type and ultra high
speed varieties of angular contact ball bearings are available
through NTN, and there are also many duplex varieties. A
bearing accuracy of JIS Class 5 or higher is applied to
duplex type angular contact ball bearings, and in many cases
they are given a preload, in compliance with standard
preload levels, before being used in an application. Table 2
shows information concerning angular contact ball bearings,
and Table 3 shows similar information for duplex angular
contact ball bearings.

¡Available in bearing series 79, 70, 72, 72B, 73, and 73B.
¡Contact angles: 30˚and 40˚ (with B) available.
¡Standard bearing cage type differs depending on bearing no. (Refer to Table 4)
¡Available in bearing series 78C, 79C,  70C, 72C, and 73C.
¡Contact angles: 15˚
¡All bearing accuracies JIS Class 5 or higher.
¡Standard bearing cage type differs depending on bearing no. (Refer to Table 4)
Standard

¡Available in bearing series HSB9C, HSB0C, BNT0, and BNT2; all boundary dimensions agree with JIS
　series dimensions.
¡Contact angles: 15˚; HSB type HSB9 and HSB0: 15˚and 30˚.
¡All bearing accuracies JIS Class 5 or higher.
¡BNT type internal design can be altered; suitable for higher speed applications than high speed use bearings.
¡HSB series bearings have smaller diameter of balls than high speed use type bearings, so benefit by less
　torque for high precision, high speed applications.
¡The inner ring bore diameter and outer ring inner diameter of the HSB series have a ground undercut on
　one side enabling easy oil flow.
¡For even higher speed applications, there is a bearing in this series equipped with ceramic ball bearings.
¡For standard cage types refer to Table 4; molded resin cages are also available for some varieties.

1.2 Four-point angular contact ball bearings
Four-point angular contact ball bearings have a contact
angle of 30˚ and inner rings which are separated in half. As
shown in Diagram 2, when the inner and outer rings receive
a radial load the ball bearings contact the inner and outer
rings at four points. This construction enables a single
bearing to accommodate axial loads from either direction,
and when generally under a simple axial load or heavy axial
load, the bearing functions in reliance on two contact points
like ordinary bearings.
■Flush ground
"Flush ground" is the name given to the finishing
method shown in Diagram 4 where the offset of the
front and back faces of the bearing are ground to the
same value. By doing this, a stated clearance or
preload value can be achieved by using bearings with
identical codes for these values, in other words by
combining either DB or DF series bearings. DT series
bearings can also be used in various arrangements to
achieve uniform load distribution.
All BNT type bearings are flush ground, but other
angular contact ball bearing series are not. If it is
necessary to flush grind any of these other bearings,
please consult NTN Engineering.

1.3 Double row angular contact ball bearings
The structure of double row angular contact ball bearings
is designed by arranging two single row angular contact
bearings back-to-back in duplex (DB) to form one united
bearing with a contact angle of 30˚.
These bearings are capable of accommodating radial

Note: 1. Duplex bearings are manufactured in a set to specified clearance and preload values, therefore they must be assembled together with
identically numbered bearings and not mixed with other arrangements.
2. Triplex arrangements of angular contact bearings are also available. Consult NTN Engineering for details.

Note: 1. Standard cages for 5S-BNT and 5S-HSB type bearings are the same as cages for BNT and HSB type bearings.
2. Due to the material characteristics of molded resin cages, use at application temperatures in excess of
120℃ is not possible.

Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer dimension r1 is identical to dimension r.
Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is, likewise, identical to ra.

Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer dimension r1 is identical to dimension r.
Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is, likewise, identical to ra.

Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer dimension r1 is identical to dimension r.
Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is, likewise, identical to ra.

●Self-Aligning Ball Bearings
1. Design features and characteristics
The outer ring raceway of self-aligning ball bearings forms
a spherical surface whose center is common to the bearing
center. The inner ring of the bearing has two raceways. The
balls, cage, and inner ring of these bearings are capable of a
shifting in order to compensate for a certain degree of
misalignment with the outer rings. As a result, the bearing is
able to align itself and compensate for shaft / housing
finishing unevenness, bearing fitting error, and other sources
of misalignment as shown in Diagram 1.
However, since axial load capacity is limited, self-aligning
bearings are not suitable for applications with heavy axial
loads.
Furthermore, if an adapter is used on the tapered bore of
the inner diameter, installation and disassembly are much
simpler and for this reason adapters are often used on
equipment with drive shafts.
B-77
2. Standard cage types
Self aligning ball bearings use pressed cages with the
exception of the 1200-1206 series which use molded resin
cages. The material characteristics of the resin cages make
them unsuitable for use in applications where temperatures
exceed 120˚C.
3. Ball protrusion
Bearings with part numbers listed in Diagram 2 below
have balls which protrude slightly from the bearing face.
Their degree of protrusion is listed in Diagram 2.

4. Allowable misalignment angle
Listed below are the allowable misalignment angles for
bearings with self-aligning characteristics when placed
under normal load conditions. This degree of allowable
misalignment may be limited by the design of structures
around the bearing.
Allowable misalignment under normal loads (loads
equivalent to 0.09 Cr):   0.07 rad (4˚)

●Cylindrical Roller Bearings
1. Types, design features, and
characteristics
Since the rolling elements in cylindrical roller bearings
make line contact with raceways, these bearings can
accommodate heavy radial loads. The rollers are guided by
ribs on either the inner or outer ring, therefore these bearings
are also suitable for high speed applications. Furthermore,
cylindrical roller bearings are separable, and relatively easy
to install and disassemble even when interference fits are
required.
Among the various types of cylindrical roller bearings,
Type E has a high load capacity and its boundary
B-89
dimensions are identical to standard type. HT type has a
large axial load capacity, and HL type provides extended
wear life in conditions where the development of a lubricating
film inside the bearing is difficult.
Double and multiple row bearing arrangements are also
available.
For extremely heavy load applications, the non-separable
full complement SL type bearing offers special advantages.
Table 1 shows the various types and characteristics of
single row cylindrical roller bearings. Table 2 shows the
characteristics of non-standard type cylindrical roller
bearings.
Type code
Design
Characteristics
¡NU type outer rings have double ribs; outer ring and roller as well as cage can be separated 
from inner ring. N type inner ring have double ribs; inner ring and roller as well as cage can 
be separated from outer ring.
¡Unable to accommodate even the slightest axial loads.
¡This type is extremely suitable for, and widely used as, the floating side bearing.
¡NJ type has double ribs on outer ring, single rib on inner ring; NF type has single rib on outer 
ring, and double rib on inner ring.
¡Can receive single direction axial loads.
¡When there is no distinction between the fixed side and floating side bearing, can be used as 
a pair in close proximity.
¡NUP type has a collar ring attached to the ribless side of the inner ring; NH type is NJ type 
with an L type collar ring attached. All of these collar rings are separable, and therefore it is 
necessary to fix the inner ring axially.
¡Can accommodate axial loads in either direction.
¡Widely used as the shaft's fixed-side bearing.

●Cylindrical Roller Bearings
B-90
Bearing type
Characteristics
E Type cylindrical
roller bearing
¡Boundary dimensions identical to standard type; load capacity can be increased by increasing roller 
diameter, roller length, or roller number.
¡Identified by addition of "E" to end of basic roller number.
¡Enables compact design due to its high load rating.
¡Rollers' inscribed circle diameter differs from standard type rollers and therefore cannot be interchanged.
Large axial load use
cylindrical roller bearings
(HT type)
Double row cylindrical
roller bearings
¡Can accommodate larger axial loads than standard type thanks to improved geometry of the rib roller 
end surface.
¡Please consult NTN Engineering concerning the many factors which require consideration, such as 
load, lubricant, and installation conditions.
Four row cylindrical
roller bearings
SL type cylindrical
roller bearings
¡NN type and NNU type available.
¡Widely used for applications requiring thin-walled bearings, such the main shafts of machine tools, 
rolling machine rollers, and in printing equipment.
¡Used mainly in the necks of rolling machine rollers; designed for maximum rated load to accommodate 
the severely limited space in the roller neck section of such equipment.
¡Many varieties exist, including sealed types, which have been specially designed for high speed use, to 
prevent creeping, provide dust and water proofing properties, etc. Contact NTN Engineering.
¡Full complement roller bearing capable of handling heavy loads.
¡Consult NTN Engineering regarding special application designs for SL type cylindrical roller bearings.
Remarks: In the dimension tables, both E type and standard type are listed, but in the future JIS will change to E type.

2. Standard cage types
Table 3 shows the standard varieties for cylindrical roller
bearings.
The basic rated loads listed in the dimension charts
correspond to values achieved with the standard cages listed
in Table 3. Furthermore, please note that even for the
identical bearing, in cases where the number of rolling
elements or the cage type  differs, the basic rated load will
also differ from the values listed in the dimension charts.

Note: 1) Within the same bearing series, cage type is  identical even
if the type code (NJ, NUP, N, NF) differs.
2) For high speed and other special applications, machined
cages can be manufactured when necessary.
Consult NTN Engineering.
3) Among E type bearings (those using molded resin
cages), certain varieties may also use pressed cages.
Consult NTN Engineering.
4) Although machined cages are standard for two row and four
row cylindrical roller bearings, molded resin cages may also
be used in some of these bearings for machine tool
applications.
5) Due to their material properties, molded resin cages
cannot be used in applications where temperatures
exceed 120℃.

3. Allowable misalignment
Although values vary somewhat depending on bearing
type and internal specifications, under general load
conditions, to avoid the occurrence of edge loading,
allowable misalignments have been set as follows:
Bearing width series 0 or 1:………………0.001   rad (3.5')
Bearing width series 2:……………………0.0005 rad (1.5')
Double row cylindrical roller bearings 1 : ……0.0005 rad (1.5')
1 Does not include high precision bearings for machine tool
main shaft applications.

●Tapered Roller Bearings
1. Types, design features, and characteristics
Tapered roller bearings are designed so that the center
lines of the raceways and rollers all converge at a single
point as shown in Diagram 1.
Due to this design feature, rollers move along the center of
the raceway surfaces. The tapered rollers are guided by the
compound force of the inner and outer raceway surfaces
which keep them pressed up against the large rib on the
inner ring. A large variety of these bearings, including single,
double, and four row arrangements, are in use both in metric
and inch system sizes.
Table 1 lists the various types of tapered roller bearings
and their characteristics.
B-131
Type
Characteristics
Single row tapered
roller bearings
(2) In addition to level type, there are also medium contact angle and large contact angle types, and the contact 
angle code C and D, respectively, is appended to the basic numbers of the latter two types.
(3) Subunits
  Tapered roller bearings can be disassembled into parts ― the inner ring, rollers, and cage (collectively 
known as the "cone") ― and the outer ring (known as the "cup"). These are the bearing’s "subunits". Subunit 
dimensions are standardized under ISO or ABMA standards, and unified subunits are interchangeable within 
each dimensional standard. However, high precision grade bearings are generally not interchangeable, and 
these subunits must be used by assembling only subunits with identical manufacturing numbers.
  Aside from any cautionary notes that may appear, the single row tapered roller bearings listed in the 
dimension tables have subunits standardized for both metric and inch systems (including J series). (Refer to 
Diagram 2)

●Tapered Roller Bearings
B-132
Type
Characteristics
(5) These bearings are constructed to have a high capacity for radial loads, 
axial loads, and combined loads. The larger the contact angle, the 
greater the axial load capacity becomes. When a pure radial load is 
placed on the bearings, an induced load in the axial direction is also 
generated, and so these bearings are generally used in pairs arranged 
face to face.
(6) When used in pairs, proper internal clearances and preload can be set by 
adjusting the distance between the two bearings' inner and outer rings.
(7) Inner and outer rings are separable, enabling them to be installed 
individually with the desired interference fit.
(8) Tapered roller bearings are also manufactured with flanges attached to 
the outer rings. For more details, contact NTN Engineering. (Refer to 
Diagram 3)
Single row tapered
roller bearings
(1) Outward facing types (using double row outer rings) and inward facing 
types (using double row inner rings) are both available, and they have 
been adjusted so that each type's internal clearance values are fixed. 
Therefore, only parts with identical manufacturing numbers can be 
used and they must be assembled according to their code numbers. 
(Refer to Diagram 4)
(2) The axial internal clearances for double and duplex bearings are 
listed in Table 8 on pages A-58, 59.
(3) Pairs of duplex single row tapered roller bearings are also 
manufactured. For more details, contact NTN Engineering.
Double row tapered
roller bearings
(1) As shown in Diagram 5, four row tapered roller bearings are 
constructed of two double row inner rings and two double row outer 
rings.
(2) Bearings wear life is greatly improved through the use of induction 
hardening and, for large-sized bearings, hollow rollers and pin type 
cages.
(3) Used primarily where heavy load capacity is important, and in the 
roller necks of rolling mills.
Four row tapered
roller bearings
Furthermore, although not listed in the dimension tables, ET type bearings are also manufactured for some extra
small bearing sizes. For details, consult NTN Engineering.
(4) Concerning ET and 4T
Types ET and 4T tapered roller bearings are made of high-purity case hardened steel and are manufactured with 
a special heat treatment developed by NTN. As a result, wear life and reliability have been improved to where life 
coefficient, a2, values can be applied as follows:
　　　　　　　　　　　　　4T tapered roller bearings:　　　　a2 ＝1.4
　　　　　　　　　　　　　ET tapered roller bearings:　　　　a2 ＝1.9

2. Standard cage type
In general, pressed cages are used in tapered roller
bearings.
However, for large sized bearings, machined or pin type
cages are also used; and for small sized bearings, molded
resin cages are also used.
3. Allowable misalignment
Single row and 
back-to-back arrangement: ………0.0005rad（1.5'）
Face-to-face: …………………………0.001rad  （3.5'）
In situations where large displacement is necessary,
please consult NTN Engineering.

●Spherical Roller Bearings
1. Types, construction and characteristics
Spherical roller bearings consist of an outer ring having a
continuous spherical raceway within which operates two
rows of barrel-shaped rollers which are in turn guided by an
inner ring with two raceways separated by a center rib.
(Refer to Diagram 1) This bearing has self-aligning
properties, and therefore is suited for use where
misalignment between the inner and outer rings occurs from
housing installation error or shaft flexure.
Spherical roller bearings have a large capacity for radial
loads, axial loads in either direction, and complex loads.
They are also suited for applications where vibration and
shock loads are encountered. When operating under axial
loads, however, it is desirable to maintain conditions so that
Fa/Fr≦2e in order to prevent sliding movement along the row
of rollers not receiving the axial load. (For the value of e,
refer to dimension tables.)
As shown in Table 1, in addition to standard type there are
various other types of spherical roller bearings. Among
these, Type E has a particularly high load capacity.

In addition to bearings with cylindrical bore diameters,
those with tapered bore diameters are also available.
Bearings with tapered bore diameters are specified by
attaching the suffix "K" to the end of the bearing's basic
number. The standard taper ratio is 1:12 for bearings with a
"K" suffix, but for bearings in series 240 and 241 the suffix
"K30" indicates the taper ratio for a bearing is 1:30. Most
tapered bore bearings incorporate the use of adapters and
withdrawal sleeves for shaft mounting.

2. Standard cage types
Standard cage types for self-aligning bearings are shown
in Table 2. In general, pressed cages are standard for small
sized bearings, and machined cages are standard for large
sized bearings.
E type bearings use as their standard cage type a cage
molded from a newly developed glass fiber reinforced
polyamide 46 resin which has excellent heat resistance
qualities (allowable operating temperatures up to
150˚C), strength, as well as unsurpassed oil resistance.
Nonetheless, for certain applications with high speed
specifications, large vibration and shock load conditions, and
extremely high operating temperature ranges, this molded
polyamide 46 resin cage cannot be used as standard.
Please consult NTN Engineering concerning applications
with these sorts of operating conditions.
If a pin is necessary to prevent outer ring rotation, contact
NTN Engineering.

3. Oil inlets and oil groove dimensions
Spherical roller bearings with an outer diameter of 320mm
or more are provided with an oil inlet  and oil groove on the
outer ring for the purpose of supplying lubricant to the
bearing's moving parts. When necessary, oil inlets and oil
grooves can also be provided on bearings with outer
diameters less than 320 mm. In such cases, please add the
supplementary suffix code "D1" to the end of the bearing
number, and contact NTN Engineering. (Refer to page A-29)
Table 3 lists dimensions for oil inlets and oil grooves.
Table 4 contains information about the number of oil inlets.
4. Allowable misalignment
Spherical roller bearings possess the same self-aligning
properties as other self-aligning bearings. The allowable
misalignment angle will vary according to dimension series
and load conditions, but the following misalignment angles
are generally standard:
Normal load (loads equivalent
to 0.09 sCr): ………………………………0.009rad (0.5˚)
Light load: …………………………………0.035rad (2˚)

---

5. Adapters and withdrawal sleeves
Adapters are used for installation of bearings with tapered
bore diameters on cylindrical shafts. Withdrawal sleeves are
also used to install and disassemble bearings with tapered
bore diameters onto and off of cylindrical shafts. In
disassembling the bearing from the shaft, the nut is pressed
down against the edge of the inner ring utilizing the bolt
provided on the withdrawal sleeve, and then the sleeve is
drawn away from the bearing's inner diameter surface.
For bearings with a bore diameter of 200 mm or more, high
pressure oil (hydraulic) type adapters and withdrawal sleeves
have been standardized to make installation and
disassembly easier. As shown in Diagram 2 construction is
designed to reduce friction by injecting high pressure oil
between the surfaces of the adapter sleeve and bearing
inner bore by means of a pressure fitting.
If the oil supply inlet is attached in the nut side of the
adapter, the supplementary suffix "HF" should be added to
the bearing number; if the oil supply inlet is attached on the
opposite side, the suffix "HB" should be added to the bearing
number. For adapter sleeves, the supplementary suffix "H" is
added to the bearing's number in both cases.
For the hydraulic sleeve's nut, the supplementary suffix
"SP" should be added to the nut's part number if a threaded
bolt hole will be provided for installation / disassembly
purposes; if a hole for a hydraulic pressure fitting will be
provided, "SPB" should be added to the end of the nut's part
number.
For more information regarding high pressure oil
(hydraulic) adapters and withdrawal sleeves, please
refer to their special catalog.
