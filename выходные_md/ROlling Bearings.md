Foreword
Schaeffler Group Industrial is a leading worldwide supplier of rolling 
bearings, spherical plain bearings, plain bearings, linear products, 
accessories specific to bearings and comprehensive maintenance 
products and services. It has approximately 40 000 catalogue 
products manufactured as standard, providing an extremely wide 
portfolio that gives secure coverage of applications from all 
60 designated industrial market sectors.
The central factors responsible for this success are our outstanding 
strength in innovation, our global focus on local customer proximity, 
highly developed manufacturing methods, extremely high quality 
standards in all processes and our ability to transform specific 
customer requirements quickly and accurately into cost-effective 
solutions.  Against this background of expertise, knowledge and 
experience together with our wide range of catalogue items, 
we see ourselves as a high performance, customer focussed partner 
in the development, manufacture and delivery of products.
Research and Development
As a company looking to the future, we are especially active in 
the field of research and development. The key areas in this respect 
include not only research into fundamental principles, materials 
technology, tribology and calculation but also extensive inspection 
and test methods as well as activities to optimise manufacturing 
technology. This is oriented towards ensuring the continuous 
development, improvement and application of our products in 
the long term.
We carry out research and development on a global basis. 
Our development centres are linked with each other worldwide and 
are thus in a position to exchange current information on a very 
short timescale as well as access and communicate the most 
recent data. This ensures that a uniform level of knowledge and 
information is available worldwide.
In addition to continued development of standard products, 
we work closely in research and development activities with our 
customers where specific customer solutions are required. They can 
thus benefit from the best product for their application, with the 
maximum possible performance capacity at a cost-effective price.
Manufacturing technologies,
quality inspections,
environmental protection
“Zero defects” is our quality objective. We have matched all our 
processes to this target. In addition, our many years of experience in 
forming of sheet metal and heavier section material, in vertical and 
horizontal forging, heat treatment, surface technologies, grinding, 
honing and assembly ensures that our products fulfil the required 
quality level.
Ongoing quality inspections are a defined component of the 
manufacturing process. These are integrated directly as a feedback 
function in the manufacturing process. This ensures that all 
products continuously fulfil the same high standard of quality.
We have a highly effective quality management system, 
and the quality of our products and processes is confirmed by 
certification; for example, all manufacturing facilities comply with 
DIN-EN ISO 9001:2000 and ISO/TS 16 949:2002.
With the validation and certification of our manufacturing sites, 
we are taking a pioneering role in environmental protection. 
All larger manufacturing sites are certified not only to ISO 14001, 
but are also validated in accordance with the more stringent 
EC ECO Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).

Foreword
Worldwide presence
Through a closely knit network of development and manufacturing 
sites, sales companies and an international distribution structure, 
we are represented throughout the world. This global presence 
ensures effective linkage between the major markets in Europe, 
India, South East Asia/Pacific Region, East Asia, North and 
South America.
As a result, we have an on-site presence with service and 
technical advice in close proximity to the customer. We take orders 
from throughout the world and make deliveries worldwide too. Our 
distribution network generally has stock of the catalogue products 
relevant to the appropriate markets and company locations and 
can therefore make deliveries within a very short timescale.
Furthermore, we support our customers worldwide in resolving 
their bearing arrangement requirements, respond to technical 
queries and develop specific bearing arrangement solutions in local 
partnership with our customers.
The new
rolling bearing catalogue –
a technical compendium
As an interface between product, complex rolling bearing 
technology and our customers, we can offer not only personal 
consultations by our external sales and application engineering 
functions, but also our technical catalogues in electronic form 
and as paper copy.
Everything in one place
By combining numerous individual catalogues in one overall 
catalogue, we have now concentrated the majority of our rotary 
bearing range in a single printed volume. Even more strongly than 
before, this bundles together our technical knowledge and our 
advisory expertise, for your benefit. In one publication, you can now 
find the required INA and FAG products, both quickly and securely.
The catalogue describes the rolling bearings in accordance with 
DIN/ISO that are required for original equipment manufacture, 
distribution and the aftermarket, specific rolling bearing accessories 
and further rolling bearing types and design variants. 
It is a completely new creation and is significantly different, 
in format as well, from all previous publications from Schaeffler 
Group Industrial.
Find it,
select it,
fit it
This catalogue constitutes a fundamental tool for information 
and advice that will assist you on all issues relating to rolling bearing 
technology. It will show you which products you may be able to use, 
what you need to consider when designing the bearing arrange-
ment, which tolerances are suitable for the adjacent construction 
and how you can achieve the most effective sealing of your bearing 
arrangement. It will also tell you how to calculate the rating life of 
the bearings, what temperatures and loads can be supported, 
which lubricants are most suitable for the bearing arrangement 
and how you should carry out maintenance at the correct times. 
Of course it also describes the correct way to install the products.
Last but not least, this catalogue also promotes dialogue between 
you and us.

Foreword
New product designations
In this catalogue, the designation system of the two brands has 
been harmonised. With this adaptation, we have also created 
a single, common standard for our customers.
The designations are now simpler and the codes are thus more 
transparent. For example, in some designs the seals for track rollers 
have been matched to those for our ball bearings and the P type 
seals have been replaced by radially preloaded seals. The suffix has 
therefore changed from PP to 2RSR and describes the radial preload 
of the contact seals on both sides.
The new prefixes, designations and suffixes are published for 
the first time in this catalogue. Orders submitted using the old 
system will of course continue to be processed very rapidly and 
to your full satisfaction.
 –
maximum customer benefit
through excellent
product quality
X-life is the premium brand of Schaeffler Group Industrial. 
It brings together the strengths of the two brands and opens up 
completely new design opportunities for design engineers. X-life is 
an all-encompassing concept: advice, product development, 
service and sales are fully integrated with each other in all phases 
of the product cycle.  As a service surround system, it includes 
a comprehensive lubrication concept. X-life stands for continuous 
quality improvement and local customer focus applied worldwide.
Advantages of
the 
 grade
The use of state of the art manufacturing technologies has resulted 
in a better, more uniform surface over the whole contact face 
between the rolling elements and raceway. As a result, under 
identical load there is a significant reduction in the stress conditions 
present on the rolling elements and raceway. The improved surface 
quality gives reduced friction and lower bearing temperatures, 
running resistance is lower and less strain is placed on the lubricant.
Thanks to such improvements, the basic dynamic load ratings are 
significantly higher than those of the previous design. As a result, 
the basic rating life is higher; i.e. the operating life of the bearings 
is considerably longer under the same operating conditions. 
Alternatively, higher loads can be applied while maintaining 
the same life values.
With their optimised characteristics, X-life bearings open up 
completely new application prospects, such as downsizing of 
the bearing arrangement. Furthermore, the improved price/
performance ratio ultimately increases the overall cost-effectiveness 
of the bearing arrangement.
X-life bearings are described in the sections on product features and 
are indicated in the dimension tables by the symbol XL.
Product ranges for
specific market sectors
Special product ranges are available for specific market sectors. 
In addition to standard products, these include a large number 
of special solutions. The range extends from simple, application-
specific bearings via complete, ready-to-fit systems to special

Load carrying capacity and life
Schaeffler KG introduced the “Expanded calculation of the adjusted 
rating life” in 1997. This method is standardised in accordance 
with DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1. The method will be incorporated in 
the next version of the international standard ISO 281.
Fatigue theory as a principle
The basis of the rating life calculation in accordance with ISO 281
is Lundberg and Palmgren’s fatigue theory which always gives a final 
rating life.
However, modern, high quality bearings can exceed by 
a considerable margin the values calculated in accordance with 
ISO 281 under favourable operating conditions. Ioannides and 
Harris have developed a further model of fatigue in rolling contact 
that expands on the Lundberg/Palmgren theory and gives a better 
description of the performance capability of modern bearings.
The method “Expanded calculation of the adjusted rating life” takes 
account of the following influences:
■the bearing load
■the fatigue limit of the material
■the extent to which the surfaces are separated by the lubricant
■the cleanliness in the lubrication gap
■additives in the lubricant
■the internal load distribution and frictional conditions in 
the bearing.
Caution!
The influencing factors, especially those relating to contamination, 
are extremely complex. A great deal of experience is essential for 
an accurate assessment. For further advice, we recommend that you 
consult the engineering service of Schaeffler Group Industrial.
The tables and diagrams can give only guide values.

Dynamic load
carrying capacity and life
The required size of a rolling bearing is dependent on the demands 
made on its:
■load carrying capacity
■rating life
■operational reliability.
The dynamic load carrying capacity is described in terms of the basic 
dynamic load ratings. The basic dynamic load ratings are based on 
DIN ISO 281.
The basic dynamic load ratings for rolling bearings are matched 
to contemporary performance standards and those published in 
previous FAG and INA catalogues.
The fatigue behaviour of the material determines the dynamic load 
carrying capacity of the rolling bearing.
The dynamic load carrying capacity is described in terms of the basic 
dynamic load rating and the basic rating life.
The rating life as a fatigue period depends on:
■the load
■the operating speed
■the statistical probability of the first appearance of failure.
The basic dynamic load rating C applies to rotating rolling bearings. 
It is:
■a constant radial load Cr for radial bearings
■a constant, concentrically acting axial load Ca for axial bearings.
The basic dynamic load rating C is that load of constant magnitude 
and direction which a sufficiently large number of apparently 
identical bearings can endure for a basic rating life of one million 
revolutions.

Calculation of the rating life
The methods for calculating the rating life are:
■the basic rating life to DIN ISO 281, page 34
■the adjusted rating life to DIN ISO 281, page 35
■the expanded adjusted rating life to DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1, 
page 38.
Basic rating life
The basic rating life L and Lh is determined using the following 
formulae:
L
106 revolutions
The basic rating life in millions of revolutions is the life reached or exceeded 
by 90% of a sufficiently large group of apparently identical bearings before 
the first evidence of material fatigue develops

Equivalent dynamic load
The equivalent dynamic load P is a calculated value. This value is 
constant in size and direction; it is a radial load for radial bearings 
and an axial load for axial bearings.
P gives the same rating life as the combined load occurring in 
practice.

Viscosity ratio
The viscosity ratio  is an indication of the quality of lubricant film 
formation:

mm2s–1
Kinematic viscosity of the lubricant at operating temperature
1
mm2s–1
Reference viscosity of the lubricant at operating temperature.
The reference viscosity 1 is determined from the mean bearing 
diameter dM = (D + d)/2 and the operating speed n, 
Figure 2, Reference viscosity 1, page 37.
The nominal vicosity of the oil at +40 °C is determined from 
the required operating viscosity  and the operating temperature , 
Figure 3, V/T diagram for mineral oils, page 37. In the case of 
greases,  is the operating viscosity of the base oil.
In the case of heavily loaded bearings with a high proportion of 
sliding contact, the temperature in the contact area of the rolling 
elements may be up to 20 K higher than the temperature measured 
on the stationary ring (without the influence of any external heat).
Caution!
Taking account of EP additives in calculation of the expanded 
adjusted rating life Lnm: see page 38.

Life adjustment factor aDIN
The standardised method for calculating the life adjustment 
factor aDIN essentially takes account of the following influences:
■the load on the bearing
■the lubrication conditions – 
viscosity and type of lubricant, speed, bearing size, additives
■the fatigue limit of the material
■the type of bearing
■the residual stress in the material
■the environmental conditions
■contamination in the lubricant.

This calculation method cannot be used for   0,1.
Taking account of EP additives
DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1, describes how EP additives are taken into 
consideration. For a viscosity ratio   1 and a contamination 
factor eC  0,2, calculation can be carried out using the value  = 1 
for lubricants with EP additives that have been proven effective. 
With severe contamination (contamination factor eC  0,2), the 
effectiveness of the additives under these contamination conditions 
must be proven. The effectiveness of the EP additives can be 
demonstrated in the actual application or on a rolling bearing test 
rig FE 8 to DIN 51819-1.
If the EP additives are proven effective and calculation is carried out 
using the value  = 1, the life adjustment factor must be restricted 
to aDIN 	 3. If the calculated value aDIN for the actual  is greater 
than 3, this value can be used in calculation.

Fatigue limit load
The fatigue limit load Cu is defined as the load below which 
– under laboratory conditions – no fatigue occurs in the material.
Life adjustment factor
for contamination
The life adjustment factor for contamination eC takes into 
consideration the influence of contamination in the lubrication gap 
on the rating life, table Factor eC.
The rating life is reduced by solid particles in the lubrication gap and 
is dependent on:
■the type, size, hardness and number of particles
■the relative lubrication film thickness
■the bearing size.
Due to the complex nature of the interaction between these 
influencing factors, only an approximate guide value can be 
attained. The values in the tables are valid for contamination by 
solid particles, table Factor eC. They do not take account of other 
contamination such as that caused by water or other fluids.
Caution!
Under severe contamination – eC → 0 – 
the bearings may fail due to wear.
In this case, the operating life is substantially less than 
the calculated life.

Load carrying capacity and life
Equivalent operating values
The rating life formulae are based on the assumption that 
the bearing load P and bearing speed n are constant.
If the load and speed are not constant, equivalent operating values 
can be determined that induce the same fatigue as the actual 
conditions.
Caution!
The equivalent operating values calculated here already take 
account of the life adjustment factors a3 or aDIN. They must not be 
applied again when calculating the adjusted rating life.
Variable load and speed
If the load and speed vary over a time period T, the speed n and 
equivalent bearing load P are calculated as follows:
Variation in steps
If the load and speed vary in steps over a time period T, the speed n 
and equivalent bearing load P are calculated as follows:
Variable load at constant speed
If the function F describes the variation in the load over the time 
period T and the speed is constant, the equivalent bearing load P 
is calculated as follows:
Load varying in steps and
constant speed
If the load varies in steps over a time period T and the speed 
is constant, the equivalent bearing load P is calculated as follows:

Oscillating bearing motion
The equivalent speed under oscillating bearing motion is calculated 
as follows:
Caution!
The formula is valid only if the angle of oscillation is greater than

Operating life
The operating life is the life actually achieved by a rolling bearing. 
It may differ significantly from the calculated life.
This may be due to wear or fatigue as a result of:
■deviating operating conditions
■misalignment between the shaft and housing
■insufficient or excessive operating clearance
■contamination
■insufficient lubrication
■excessive operating temperature
■oscillating bearing motion with very small angles of oscillation 
– false brinelling
■high vibration and false brinelling
■very high shock loads – leading to static overloading
■prior damage during installation.
Due to the wide variety of possible installation and operating 
conditions, it is not possible to precisely predetermine the operating 
life. The most reliable way of arriving at a close estimate is by 
comparison with similar applications.

Load carrying capacity and life
Axial load carrying capacity
of cylindrical roller bearings
Radial cylindrical roller bearings used as semi-locating and 
locating bearings can support axial forces in one or both directions 
in addition to radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on:
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Caution!
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height, 
Figure 9.
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support at the rib. Special analysis is required in 
this case.
The limiting load Fa max must not be exceeded, in order to avoid 
unacceptable pressure at the contact surfaces. Calculation of axial 
load: see page 49.
The ratio Fa/Fr must not exceed a value of 0,4.
Continuous axial loading without simultaneous radial loading is not 
permissible.

Load carrying capacity and life
Static load carrying capacity
Very high static loads or shock loads can cause plastic deformation 
on the raceways and rolling elements. This deformation limits 
the static load carrying capacity of the rolling bearing with respect to 
the permissible noise level during running.
If a rolling bearing operates without rotary motion or with only 
infrequent rotary motion, its size is determined in accordance with 
the basic static load rating C0.
According to DIN ISO 76, this is:
■a constant radial load C0r for radial bearings
■a constant, concentrically acting axial load C0a for axial bearings.
The basic static load rating C0 is that load under which 
the Hertzian pressure at the most heavily loaded point between 
the rolling elements and raceways reaches the following values: 
■for roller bearings, 4 000 N/mm2
■for ball bearings, 4 200 N/mm2
■for self-aligning ball bearings, 4 600 N/mm2.
Under normal contact conditions, this load causes a permanent 
deformation at the contact points of approx. 1/10 000 of the rolling 
element diameter.

Rigidity
The rigidity of a rolling bearing is dependent on the bearing type, 
size and operating clearance. 
The rigidity increases with the number of rolling elements 
supporting the load.
Rolling bearings with line contact have a higher rigidity than rolling 
bearings with point contact, Figure 1.
Deflection
Rolling bearings have a progressive deflection rate. 
The displacement values can be determined using approximation 
formulae.
Caution!
The formulae are valid for bearings without misalignment and 
with a rigid surrounding structure.
In axial bearings, a concentrically acting load is assumed.

Friction and increases in temperature
Friction
The friction in a rolling bearing is made up of several components, 
see table Frictional component and influencing factor. Due to 
the large number of influencing factors, the frictional torque and 
thus the frictional energy can only be calculated in approximate 
terms and on the precondition of constant operating conditions.
Frictional component
and influencing factor
The idling friction is dependent on:
■the quantity of lubricant
■the speed
■the operating viscosity of the lubricant
■the seals
■the running-in condition of the bearing.
Heat dissipation
Friction is converted into heat; this heat is dissipated from 
the bearing. The equilibrium between the frictional energy and 
heat dissipation allows calculation of the thermally permissible 
speed nper, see Speeds, page 62.
Heat dissipation
by the lubricant
If oil lubrication is used, a portion of the heat is dissipated by the oil: 
recirculating oil lubrication with additional cooling is particularly 
effective.
Caution!
Grease does not give dissipation of heat.
Heat dissipation
via the shaft and housing
Heat dissipation via the shaft and housing is dependent on the 
temperature difference between the bearing and the surrounding 
structure, Figure 1.
Caution!
Any additional adjacent sources of heat or thermal radiation must be 
taken into consideration.

Bearing factors
The bearing factors f0 and f1 are mean values determined from 
series of tests and corresponding data according to ISO 15 312.
They are valid for grease lubrication applied to fitted bearings. 
In the freshly greased state, the bearing factor f0 may be higher by 
a factor of between two and five.
If oil mist lubrication is used, a marginal lubricant supply is 
assumed.
If oil bath lubrication is used, the oil level must reach the centre 
of the lowest rolling element. If the oil level is higher, f0 may be up 
to 3 times the value given in the table, Figure 2.

Speeds
On the basis of DIN 732-1, calculation of the thermal reference 
speed nB has been standardised in ISO 15312. The calculation of 
reference speeds was matched to this standard, giving modified 
values compared to the previous catalogue data.
The symbols used in the formulae have been matched to 
the international standard.
Thermal reference speed
The thermal reference speed nB is used as an auxiliary quantity 
for calculating the thermally safe operating speed nper. 
This is the speed at which, under defined reference conditions, 
a bearing operating temperature of +70 °C is achieved. 
Reference conditions
The reference conditions are based on the usual operating 
conditions of the most significant bearing types and sizes.
They are defined as follows in ISO 15 312:
■mean ambient temperature Ar = +20 °C
■mean bearing temperature at the outer ring r = +70 °C
■load on radial bearings: P1r = 0,05 · C0r
■load on axial bearings: P1a = 0,02 · C0a
■operating viscosities:
These are selected for radial bearings such that similar reference 
speeds are achieved for both oil and grease lubrication
– radial bearings: 12 mm2s–1 (ISO VG 32)
– axial bearings: 24 mm2s–1 (ISO VG 68)
■heat dissipation through the bearing seating surfaces in 
accordance with the following formulae:
for radial bearings, bearing seat Ar 	 50 000 mm2
for radial bearings, bearing seat Ar  50 000 mm2
for axial bearings, bearing seat Ar 	 50 000 mm2
for axial bearings, bearing seat Ar  50 000 mm2
Limiting speed
The limiting speed nG  is based on practical experience. 
It takes account of additional criteria such as smooth running, 
sealing function and centrifugal forces.
Caution!
The limiting speed must not be exceeded even under favourable 
operating and cooling conditions.

Thermally safe
operating speed
The thermally safe operating speed nper is calculated according 
to DIN 732-2 (draft). Calculation is based on the heat balance in 
the bearing, the equilibrium between frictional energy as a function 
of speed and heat dissipation as a function of temperature. 
When equilibrium is present, the bearing temperature is constant.
The permissible operating temperature determines the thermally 
safe operating speed nper of the bearing. The preconditions for 
calculation are correct fitting, normal operating clearance and 
constant operating conditions.
The calculation method is not valid for:
■sealed bearings with contact seals, since the maximum speed is 
restricted by the permissible sliding speed at the seal lip
■yoke and stud type track rollers
■aligning needle roller bearings
■axial deep groove and axial angular contact ball bearings.
Calculation of the thermally
safe operating speed
The thermally safe operating speed nper is the product of 
the reference speed nB and the speed ratio fn:
Caution!
The limiting speed must be observed.
The speed ratio is derived from Figure 1, page 64:
In the normal range 0,01  kL  10 and 0,01  kP  10,

Lubrication
Principles
Lubrication and maintenance are important for the reliable 
operation and long operating life of rolling bearings.
Functions of the lubricant
The lubricant should, Figure 1:
■form a lubricant film on the contact surfaces that is sufficiently 
capable of supporting loads and thus preventing wear and 
premature fatigue 
■dissipate heat in the case of oil lubrication 
■give additional sealing of the bearing, in the case of grease 
lubrication, against the entry of both solid and fluid 
contaminants 
■reduce the running noise 
■protect the bearing against corrosion .
Selection of
the type of lubrication
It should be determined as early as possible in the design process 
whether bearings should be lubricated using grease or oil.
The following factors are decisive in determining the type of 
lubrication and quantity of lubricant:
■the operating conditions
■the type and size of the bearing
■the adjacent construction
■the lubricant feed.
Criteria for grease lubrication
In the case of grease lubrication, the following criteria must be 
considered:
■very little design work required
■sealing action
■reservoir effect
■long operating life with little maintenance work 
(“for life” lubrication possible in certain circumstances)
■if relubrication is required, it may be necessary to provide 
collection areas for old grease and feed ducts
■no heat dissipation by the lubricant
■no rinsing out of wear debris and other particles.

Criteria for oil lubrication
In the case of oil lubrication, the following criteria must be 
considered:
■good lubricant distribution and supply to contact areas
■dissipation of heat possible from the bearing 
(significant principally at high speeds and/or loads)
■rinsing out of wear debris
■very low friction losses with minimal quantity lubrication
■more work required on feed and sealing.
Under extreme operating conditions (such as very high 
temperatures, vacuum, aggressive media), it may be possible to use 
special lubrication methods such as solid lubricants in consultation 
with the engineering service.
Design of lubricant feed
When designing feed lines and lubrication holes in the housings 
and shafts, Figure 2 and Figure 3:
■these should lead directly to the lubrication hole in the rolling 
bearing
■they should be as short as possible
■an individual feed should be provided for each bearing.
Caution!
Ensure that the feeds are filled, Figure 2; the feed line should be 
bled if necessary.
Follow the instructions provided by the lubrication device 
manufacturer.

Lubrication
Grease lubrication
Greases can be differentiated in terms of their thickeners and 
base oils. The base oils of greases are covered by the information in 
the section “Oil lubrication”, page 83.
Composition of a grease
Conventional greases have metal soaps as thickeners and a mineral 
base oil.
They also contain additives. These have a specific influence on, 
for example, the characteristics in relation to wear prevention, 
corrosion prevention or resistance to ageing. These combinations of 
additives are not, however, fully effective across every temperature 
and load range.
Greases exhibit widely varying behaviour in response to 
environmental influences such as temperature and moisture.
Caution!
Lubricants should be checked for their compatibility with:
■other lubricants
■anti-corrosion agents
■thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers
■light and non-ferrous metals
■coatings
■colouring agents and paints
■the environment.
When considering compatibility with the environment, 
attention must be paid to toxicity, biodegradability and 
water pollution class.

Type of grease
The characteristics of a grease are dependent on:
■the base oil
■the viscosity of the base oil 
(this is important for the speed range)
■the thickener 
(the shear strength is significant for the speed range)
■the additives.
Consistency of greases
Greases are subdivided into consistency classes – NLGI classes– 
(DIN 51 818). For rolling bearings, classes 1, 2 or 3 should be used 
in preference, Figure 5.
Selection of suitable grease
Rolling bearing greases K to DIN 51 825 are suitable.
Suitable greases should be selected in accordance with 
the operating conditions of the bearing:
■temperature
■compressive load
■speed
■the presence of water/moisture.
Operating temperature range
The operating temperature range of the grease must correspond to 
the range of possible operating temperatures in the rolling bearing.
Grease manufacturers indicate an operating temperature range for 
their rolling bearing greases K in accordance with DIN 51 825.
The upper value is determined in accordance with DIN 51 821 by 
means of testing using the FAG rolling bearing grease test rig FE 9. 
At the upper operating temperature, a 50% failure probability (F50) 
of at least 100 hours must be achieved in this test.
The lower value is defined in accordance with DIN 51 825 by means 
of flow pressure. The flow pressure of a grease is the pressure 
required to press a stream of grease through a defined nozzle.
For greases of type K, the flow pressure at the lower operating 
temperature must be less than 1400 mbar.

Lubrication
The use of flow pressure in determining the lower operating 
temperature only indicates, however, whether the grease can be 
moved at this temperature. This cannot be used to give an indication 
of its suitability for use in rolling bearings at low temperatures.
In addition to the lower operating temperature of a grease, therefore, 
the low temperature frictional torque is also determined in 
accordance with ASTM D 1478 or IP 186/93. At the lower operating 
temperature, the starting torque must not exceed 1000 Nmm and 
the running torque must not exceed 100 Nmm.
Schaeffler Group Industrial recommends that greases should be 
used in accordance with the bearing temperature normally occurring 
in the standard operating range in order to achieve a reliable 
lubricating action and an acceptable grease operating life, Figure 6.
At low temperatures, greases release very little base oil. This can 
result in lubricant starvation. Schaeffler Group Industrial therefore 
recommends that greases are not used below the lower continuous 
limit temperature Tlowerlimit, Figure 6. This is approx. 20 K above 
the lower operating temperature of the grease as indicated by 
the grease manufacturer.
The upper continuous limit temperature Tupperlimit must not be 
exceeded if a reduction in the grease operating life due to 
temperature is to be avoided. See the section Grease operating life, 
page 74.
Caution!
At consistently low temperatures (for example in cold store 
applications), it must be ensured that the grease releases sufficient 
oil in relation to the bearing type.

Pressure properties
The viscosity at operating temperature must be sufficiently high 
for the formation of a lubricant film capable of supporting loads.
At high loads, greases with EP characteristics – “extreme pressure” 
– and high base oil viscosity should be used (KP grease to 
DIN 51 825). Such greases should also be used for bearings with 
substantial sliding or line contact.
Silicone greases should only be used at low loads (P 	 3% C).
Caution!
Greases with solid lubricants should preferably be used for 
applications with mixed or boundary friction conditions.
The solid lubricant particle size must not exceed 5 m.
Speed
Grease should be selected in accordance with the speed 
parameter n · dM for grease (see table, page 72 and page 73):
■For rolling bearings running at high speeds or with a low starting 
torque, greases with a high speed parameter should be used.
■For bearings running at low speeds, greases with a low speed 
parameter should be used.
Under centrifugal acceleration greater than 500 g, separation 
(of the thickener and base oil) may occur. In this case, please consult 
the lubricant manufacturer.
Caution!
The consistency of polycarbamide greases can be altered by shear 
stresses to a greater extent than that of metal soap greases.
Water/moisture
Water in the grease has a highly detrimental effect on the operating 
life of the bearing:
■the static behaviour of greases in the presence of water is 
assessed in accordance with DIN 51 807, see Figure 7
■the anti-corrosion characteristics can be tested according to 
DIN 51 802 (Emcor test) – information is given in the grease 
manufacturer’s data sheets.

Guidelines on calculating
the grease operating life
Combined rolling bearings
Caution!
The radial and axial bearing components must be calculated 
separately – the decisive value is the shorter grease operating life.
Rotating outer ring
If the outer ring rotates, there may be a reduction in the grease 
operating life.
In the case of yoke and stud type track rollers:
■angular misalignment must be zero
■the effect of the rotating outer ring on the grease operating life is 
taken into consideration in the bearing type factor kf.
Restrictions
Caution!
The grease operating life cannot be determined using the above 
method:
■if the grease can flow out of the rolling bearing
– there is excessive evaporation of the base oil
– in bearings without seals
– in axial bearings with a horizontal axis of rotation
■if air is sucked into the rolling bearing during operation
– this can cause the grease to oxidise

If increased escape of grease is expected, for example in radial 
bearings with a vertical axis of rotation, the factor according to 
the table Factor KS for vertical shafts must be applied.
Factor KS for vertical shafts
Relubrication intervals
For rolling bearings that are relubricated, attention must be paid 
to the lubrication interval in order to ensure reliable function of 
the bearings.
Caution!
The precise lubrication interval should be determined by tests 
conducted under application conditions:
■sufficiently long observation periods must be used
■the condition of the grease must be checked at regular intervals.
In most applications, experience has shown that the guide value is:
tfR
h
Guide value for relubrication interval
tfG
h
Guide value for grease operating life.
Conditions
The grease should be the same as that used for initial greasing.
If different greases are used, their miscibility and compatibility 
should be checked.
Relubrication should be carried out:
■with the bearing still warm from operation and rotating if safe to 
do so
■before the bearing comes to rest if safe to do so
■before extended breaks in operation.
Relubrication quantity
Due to the compact construction of INA/FAG bearings, 
we recommend that relubrication should be carried out using 
50% to 80% of the initial greasing quantity.
If feed lines filled with air are present, the filling volume of the feed 
lines should be included in calculation of the relubrication quantity.
Relubrication
Regreasing should continue until a fresh collar of grease appears 
at the seal gaps. Old grease must be able to leave the bearing 
unhindered.

The initial greasing quantity is between 30% and 100% of 
the available volume in the bearing, dependent on the bearing type 
and operating conditions.
A grease reservoir can extend the grease operating life. The grease 
in the reservoir must be in constant contact with the grease on the 
raceway. The grease operating life does not increase proportionally 
with the size of the grease reservoir.
The volume of the grease reservoir should correspond to the area 
in the bearing between the inner and outer ring (not taking account 
of the cage and rolling elements), Figure 13 and Figure 14.

Miscibility
Mixing of greases should be avoided if at all possible.
If mixing of greases is unavoidable, the following preconditions 
must be fulfilled:
■same base oil
■compatible thickener types
■similar base oil viscosities – 
differing by no more than one ISO VG class
■same consistency – NLGI class.
Caution!
Consult the grease manufacturer.
Even if these preconditions are fulfilled, impairment of 
the performance capability of the mixed grease cannot be ruled out.
If a conscious decision is taken to change to a different grease grade, 
the grease should be rinsed out if this is permitted by the design of 
the mounting location. Further relubrication should be carried out 
after a shortened period.
Caution!
If incompatible greases are mixed this may lead to substantial 
structural changes and even to a substantial softening of the mixed 
grease.
Definite statements on miscibility can only be obtained by means of 
suitable tests.
Storage
Experience shows that the greases used can be stored for up to 
3 years.
The preconditions are:
■a closed room or store
■temperatures between 0 °C and + 40 °C
■relative humidity no more than 65%
■no influence of chemical agents – vapours, gases, fluids
■the bearings are sealed.
Caution!
Lubricants age due to environmental influences. The information 
provided by the lubricant manufacturer should be adhered to.
After long periods of storage, the start-up frictional torque of 
greased bearings can be temporarily higher than normal. 
The lubricity of the grease may also have deteriorated.
Since the lubrication characteristics of greases vary and different 
raw materials may be used for greases of the same name as a result 
of globalisation, we cannot offer any guarantees either for 
the lubricants used by customers for relubrication or for their 
characteristics in operation.

Oil lubrication
For the lubrication of rolling bearings, mineral oils and synthetic oils 
are essentially suitable. Oils with a mineral oil base are used most 
frequently. They must fulfil at least the requirements according to 
DIN 51 517 or DIN 51 524. 
Special oils, often synthetic oils, are used under extreme operating 
conditions or where there are special requirements relating to 
oil resistance. 
Caution!
In thes cases, please consult the lubricant manufacturer or 
our engineering service.
Operating temperatures
Caution!
The information provided by the lubricant manufacturer should be 
taken as authoritative.
Selection of suitable oil
The achievable life and security against wear are higher with better

Reference viscosity for mineral oils
The guide value for 1 is dependent on:
■the mean bearing diameter dM and the speed n.
The guide value 1 takes account of:
■the EHD theory on the formation of a lubricant film
■practical experience.
Depending on the operating speed, the oil at operating temperature 
must have at least the reference viscosity 1, Figure 16.
Calculation of reference viscosity
Calculate the reference viscosity 1 in accordance with the example, 
Figure 16:
■Assign 1 to a nominal viscosity 
with ISO VG between 10 and 1500
– centre point viscosity to DIN 51 519
■Round intermediate values should be rounded to 
the nearest ISO VG
– due to the steps between the groups.
Caution!
This method cannot be used for synthetic oils, since these have 
different viscosity/pressure and viscosity/temperature 
characteristics.
Please consult our engineering service.

Influence of
temperature on viscosity
As the temperature increases, the viscosity of the oil decreases. 
This temperature-dependent change in the viscosity is described 
using the viscosity index VI. For mineral oils, this VI should be at 
least 95.
Caution!
When selecting the viscosity, the lower operating temperature must 
be taken into consideration:
■increasing viscosity restricts the flow behaviour of the lubricant 
and leads to increased power losses.
Very long life can be achieved with a viscosity ratio  = /1 = 3 to 4 
( = operating viscosity). Highly viscous oils do not, however, 
bring only advantages. In addition to the aforementioned power 
losses due to lubrication friction, there may be problems with 
the feed and removal of oil at low or even at normal temperatures.
The oil must therefore be selected to be sufficiently viscous that the 
longest possible fatigue life is achieved while ensuring satisfactory 
supply of oil to the bearings at all times.
Pressure properties of oil
If the bearings are subjected to high loads or the operating viscosity 
 is less than the reference viscosity 1, oils with anti-wear additives 
(type P to DIN 51 502) should be used.
Such oils are also necessary for types of rolling bearings with 
a substantial proportion of sliding contact (for example bearings 
with line contact).
These additives form boundary layers to reduce the harmful effects 
of metallic contact occurring at various areas (wear).
The suitability of these additives varies and is normally heavily 
dependent on temperature. Their effectiveness can only be 
assessed by means of testing in the rolling bearing 
(for example on our test rig FE8 in accordance with DIN 51 819).
Caution!
Silicone oils should only be used for low loads (P 	 3% C).
Compatibility
Caution!
Before oils are used, their behaviour must be checked in relation 
to plastics, seal materials (elastomers) and light and non-ferrous 
metals.
This must be checked under dynamic conditions and at operating 
temperature.
Synthetic oils must always be checked for their compatibility and 
the lubricant manufacturer must be consulted.
Miscibility
Mixing of different oils should be avoided wherever possible. 
In particular, the presence of different additive packages may lead to 
undesirable interactions.
In general, oils with a mineral oil base and the same classification 
are miscible, for example two oils both of type HLP can be mixed.
The viscosities should vary by no more than one ISO VG class.
Caution!
Synthetic oils must always be checked for their compatibility and 
the lubricant manufacturer must be consulted.
Miscibility must be checked in advance for each individual case.

Cleanliness
The cleanliness of the oil influences the rating life of bearings, 
see section Expanded adjusted rating life.
Recommendation:
■An oil filter should be provided and attention should be paid to 
the filtration rate (recommended filter mesh  25 m).
Lubrication methods
A distinction can essentially be drawn between the following 
methods:
■drip feed oil lubrication
■pneumatic oil lubrication
– in order to protect the environment, this should be used as 
a substitute for oil mist lubrication
■oil bath lubrication
– splash or sump lubrication
■recirculating oil lubrication.
Drip feed oil lubrication
This method is suitable for bearings running at high speeds, 
Figure 17.
The oil quantity required is dependent on the type and size of 
bearing, the operating speed and the load.
The guide value is between 3 drops/min and 50 drops/min for each 
rolling element raceway (one drop weighs approx. 0,025 g).
Caution!
Excess oil must be allowed to flow out of the bearing arrangement.

Pneumatic oil lubrication
This method is particularly suitable for radial bearings running 
at high speeds and under low loads (n · dM = 800 000 to 
3 000 000 min–1 · mm). Parameters for designing the equipment 
should be requested from the lubrication device manufacturer, 
Figure 18.
With a pneumatic oil lubrication system designed for minimal 
quantity lubrication, low frictional torque and a low operating 
temperature can be achieved.
Clean compressed air free from moisture feeds oil to the bearing. 
This generates an excess pressure. This prevents contaminants from 
entering the bearing.
Pneumatic oil lubrication has little cooling effect.
Caution!
Pneumatic oil lubrication of axial bearings should be avoided if 
possible.
The oil quantity required for adequate supply is dependent on 
the bearing type.
Follow the instructions provided by the lubrication device 
manufacturer.

Oil bath lubrication
The oil level should reach the centre line of the lowest rolling 
element, Figure 19. If the oil level is higher than this, the bearing 
temperature may increase at high circumferential speeds and losses 
due to splashing may occur. Furthermore, foaming of the oil may 
occur.
In general, the method is suitable up to 
n · dM = 300 000 min–1 · mm.
At n · dM   150 000 min–1 · mm, the bearing may be fully 
immersed.
In bearings with an asymmetrical cross-section, oil return ducts 
must be provided due to the pumping effect so that recirculation can 
be achieved.
In axial bearings, the oil level must cover the inside diameter of 
the axial cage.
The oil quantity in the housing must be adequately proportioned, 
otherwise very short oil change intervals will be necessary.

Recirculating oil lubrication
In recirculating oil lubrication, the oil is subjected to additional 
cooling, Figure 20. The oil can therefore dissipate heat from 
the bearing. The quantity of oil required for heat dissipation is 
dependent on the cooling conditions, see section Speeds.
The oil quantities V are matched to the operating conditions, 
Figure 21. The diagram indicates oil quantities that can be fed 
through the bearing without pressure with a side feed arrangement 
and banking up to the lower edge of the shaft.
For bearings with an asymmetrical cross-section (such as angular 
contact ball bearings, tapered roller bearings, axial spherical roller 
bearings), larger throughput quantities are permissible due to the 
pumping effect than for bearings with a symmetrical cross-section. 
Large quantities can be used to dissipate wear debris or heat.

Oil changes
In general, an annual oil change is sufficient for temperatures in 
the bearing of less than +50 °C and low levels of contamination.
Severe operating conditions
Under severe conditions, the oil should be changed more frequently.
This applies, for example, in the case of higher temperatures and 
low oil quantities with high recirculation frequencies.
The recirculation frequency indicates how often the entire oil volume 
available is recirculated and pumped per hour:

Radial internal clearance
The radial internal clearance applies to bearings with an inner ring 
before the bearing is fitted. It is defined as the amount by which 
the inner ring can be moved in a radial direction from one extreme 
position to the other in relation to the outer ring, Figure 1.
The radial internal clearance is subdivided into groups according to 
DIN 620 and ISO 5 753, see table Radial internal clearance groups. 
The values for the radial internal clearance are given in DIN 620-4, 
ISO 5 753 and in the Features section of the product description.
Radial internal clearance groups
1) Internal clearance group values: see also product sections.
Enveloping circle
In bearings without inner ring, the enveloping circle value Fw is used. 
This is the inner inscribed circle of the needle rollers in clearance-
free contact with the outer raceway, Figure 2. For unfitted bearings, 
it is in tolerance zone F6 (except for drawn cup needle roller 
bearings).

Operating clearance
The operating clearance is determined on a fitted bearing still 
warm from operation. It is defined as the amount by which the shaft 
can be moved in a radial direction from one extreme position to 
the other, Figure 3.
The operating clearance is derived from the radial internal clearance 
and the change in the radial internal clearance as a result of 
interference fit and thermal influences in the fitted condition.
Operating clearance value
The operating clearance value is dependent on the operating and 
installation conditions of the bearing.
A larger operating clearance is necessary, for example, if heat 
is transferred via the shaft, the shaft undergoes deflection or 
if misalignment occurs.
An operating clearance smaller than CN should only be used in 
special cases, for example in high precision bearing arrangements.
The normal operating clearance is achieved with internal 
clearance CN or, in larger bearings, predominantly with C3 if 
the recommended shaft and housing tolerances are fulfilled, 
see section Design of bearing arrangements, page 125.
Caution!
Please observe the design guidelines in the section Design of 
bearing arrangements.

Bearing materials
INA and FAG rolling bearings fulfil the requirements for fatigue 
strength, wear resistance, hardness, toughness and structural 
stability.
The material used for the rings and rolling elements is generally 
a low alloy, through hardening chromium steel of high purity. 
For bearings subjected to considerable shock loads and 
reversed bending stresses, case hardening steel is also used 
(supplied by agreement).
In recent years, the improved quality of rolling bearing steels 
has been the principal factor in achieving considerable increases 
in basic load ratings. 
The results of research as well as practical experience confirm 
that bearings made from the steel currently used as standard can 
achieve their endurance limit if loads are not excessively high and 
the lubrication and cleanliness conditions are favourable.
High Nitrogen Steel
Through the use of special bearings made from HNS (High Nitrogen 
Steel, supplied by agreement), it is possible to achieve 
adequate service life even under the most challenging conditions 
(high temperatures, moisture, contamination).
Ceramic materials
Ceramic hybrid spindle bearings contain balls made from silicon 
nitride. These ceramic balls are substantially lighter than steel balls. 
The centrifugal forces and friction are significantly lower.
Hybrid bearings allow very high speeds – even with grease 
lubrication – as well as long operating life and low operating 
temperatures.

Cages
The most important functions of the cage are:
■to separate the rolling elements from each other in order to 
minimise friction and heat generation
■to maintain the rolling elements at the same distance from 
each other in order to ensure uniform load distribution
■to prevent the rolling elements from falling out in bearings that 
can be dismantled or swivelled out
■to guide the rolling elements in the load zone of the bearing.
Rolling bearing cages are subdivided into sheet metal and solid 
section cages.
Sheet metal cages
These cages are predominantly made from steel and for some 
bearings from brass, Figure 4. In comparison with solid section 
cages made from metal, they are of lower mass. 
Since a sheet metal cage only fills a small proportion of the gap 
between the inner and outer ring, lubricant can easily reach 
the interior of the bearing and is held on the cage.
In general, a sheet steel cage is only included in the bearing 
designation if it is not defined as a standard version of the bearing.
Solid section cages
These cages are made from metal, laminated fabric or plastic, 
Figure 5. They can be identified from the bearing designation.
Solid section cages made from
metal or laminated fabric
Solid section cages made from metal are used where there are 
requirements for high cage strength and at high temperatures. 
Solid section cages are also used if the cage must be guided on ribs. 
Rib-guided cages for bearings running at high speeds are made in 
many cases from light materials such as light metal or laminated 
fabric in order to achieve low inertia forces.
Solid section cages made from
polyamide PA66
Solid section cages made from polyamide 66 are produced using 
injection moulding, Figure 6. Cage types can thus generally be 
realised that allow designs with particularly high load carrying 
capacity. The elasticity and low mass of polyamide are favourable 
under shock type bearing loads, high accelerations and 
decelerations und tilting of the bearing rings in relation to each 
other. Polyamide cages have very good sliding and emergency 
running characteristics.
Cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide 66 are suitable 
for long term temperatures up to +120 °C.
Caution!
When using oil lubrication, additives in the oil can impair the cage 
operating life. The interrelationship between the cage operating life, 
the long term temperature of the stationary bearing ring and 
the lubricant is shown in Figure 7, page 102. Aged oil can also 
impair the cage operating life at high temperatures, so attention 
must be paid to compliance with the oil change intervals.

Guidance method
A further means of distinguishing between cages is their guidance 
method, Figure 8. Most cages are guided by the rolling elements and 
do not have a suffix for the guidance method.
If guidance is by the bearing outer ring, the suffix A is used. 
Cages that are guided on the inner ring have the suffix B.
Under normal operating conditions, the cage design defined as 
the standard cage is generally suitable. Standard cages that may 
differ within a bearing series according to the bearing size are 
described in the product sections.
Under special operating conditions, a cage that is suitable for 
the specific conditions must be selected.

Operating temperature
Rolling bearings are thermally stabilised such that, depending 
on the bearing type, they are generally dimensionally stable up to 
+120 °C or +150 °C.
Operating temperatures above +150 °C require special heat 
treatment. Bearings treated in this way are available by agreement 
and are identified by the suffix S1 ... S4 (DIN 623-1).
Temperature range and corresponding suffixes: 
see table Bearings for high temperatures.
Caution!
The temperature data in the product sections must be observed.
Bearings for high temperatures –
suffixes
Track rollers
An operating temperature of +70 °C is regarded as a normal 
operating temperature. Further temperature data in the product 
descriptions must be observed.
Sealed bearings
The permissible temperature for sealed bearings is dependent 
on the requirements for the operating life of the grease filling and 
on the action of the contact seals.
Sealed bearings are greased with specially tested, high 
performance, high quality greases. These greases can withstand 
+120 °C for short periods. At long term temperatures of +70 °C
and above, a reduction in the operating life of standard greases with 
a lithium soap base must be expected.
In many cases, adequate operating life values are only achieved at 
high temperatures through the use of special greases. In these 
cases, it must also be checked whether seals made from especially 
heat-resistant materials must be used. The operating limit of normal 
contact seals is +100 °C.
Caution!
If high temperature synthetic materials are used for seals and 
greases, it must be noted that the particularly high performance 
materials containing fluoride may give off harmful gases and 
vapours when heated to approx. +300 °C and above. This may 
occur, for example, if a welding torch is used in the dismantling 
of a bearing.
High temperatures are critical especially in the case of seals made 
from fluoroelastomer (FKM, FPM, e.g. Viton) or greases containing 
fluoride such as the rolling bearing grease Arcanol TEMP200 and 
greases to GA11.
If high temperatures are unavoidable, attention must be paid to the 
valid safety data sheet for the specific fluoride-containing material, 
which can be obtained upon request.

Anti-corrosion protection
Bearings are not resistant to corrosion by water or agents containing 
alkalis or acids but are often exposed to these corrosion-inducing 
agents. In these applications, anti-corrosion protection is therefore 
a decisive factor in achieving a long operating life of the bearings.
In principle, corrosion-resistant steels to ISO 693-17 can be used for 
components at risk of corrosion. These bearings have the prefix S; 
for deep groove ball bearings with anti-corrosion protection, 
see page 186. In many applications, however, the INA special 
plating Corrotect® is more cost-effective.
Corrotect® plating
Corrotect® is an extremely thin, electroplated surface coating – 
coating thickness 0,5 m to 3 m.
The coating is effective against moisture, contaminated water, 
salt spray and weakly alkaline and weakly acidic cleaning agents.
Advantages of the plating
The advantages of the INA special plating Corrotect® are all-round 
rust protection, including the turned surfaces of chamfers and radii, 
Figure 9. It also gives long term prevention of rust penetration 
beneath seals and smaller bright spots are protected against rust 
by the cathodic protection effect. In comparison with unplated 
parts, operating life is significantly increased by the anti-corrosion 
protection. Unplated bearings can be easily replaced by plated 
bearings of the same dimensions; there is no decrease in load 
carrying capacity, in contrast to corrosion-resistant steels. During 
storage, there is no need to use organic-based preservatives.
Fitting of plated bearings
Caution!
Before bearings plated with Corrotect® are fitted, compatibility with 
the media should always be checked.
In order to reduce the press-in force required, the surface of 
the parts should be lightly greased – the tolerances are increased by 
the thickness of the plating.

Dimensional and
geometrical tolerances
Unless stated otherwise, the tolerances for radial rolling bearings 
correspond to DIN 620-2 and ISO 492; the tolerances for axial rolling 
bearings correspond to DIN 620-3 and ISO 199, Figure 10.
The accuracy corresponds to tolerance class PN. For bearings with 
increased accuracy, the tolerances are restricted to values in 
the classes P6, P5, P4 and P2. Tolerance tables for the individual 
tolerance classes: see page 107 to page 120.
The standardised tolerance classes are not applied to high precision 
bearings, which are produced to the tolerance classes P4S, SP 
and UP. These tolerances are listed in the product descriptions for 
the high precision bearings.
Measurement methods according to DIN 620-1 and ISO 1132-2 are 
valid for the acceptance inspection of rolling bearings.

Design of bearing arrangements
Selection
of bearing arrangement
The guidance and support of a rotating shaft requires at least 
two bearings arranged at a certain distance from each other. 
Depending on the application, a decision is made between 
a locating/non-locating bearing arrangement, an adjusted bearing 
arrangement and a floating bearing arrangement.
Locating/non-locating
bearing arrangement
On a shaft supported by two radial bearings, the distances between 
the bearing seats on the shaft and in the housing frequently do not 
coincide as a result of manufacturing tolerances. The distances may 
also change as a result of temperature increases during operation. 
These differences in distance are compensated in the non-locating 
bearing. Examples of locating/non-locating bearing arrangements: 
see Figure 1 to Figure 4.
Non-locating bearings
Ideal non-locating bearings are cylindrical roller bearings with 
cage of series N and NU or needle roller bearings, Figure 1 , . 
In these bearings, the roller and cage assembly can be displaced on 
the raceway of the bearing ring without ribs.
All other bearing types, for example deep groove ball bearings 
and spherical roller bearings, can only act as non-locating bearings 
if one bearing ring has a fit that allows displacement, Figure 2. 
The bearing ring subjected to point load therefore has a loose fit; 
this is normally the outer ring, see Conditions of rotation, page 132.
Locating bearings
The locating bearing guides the shaft in an axial direction and 
supports external axial forces. In order to prevent axial preload, 
shafts with more than two bearings have only one locating bearing.
The type of bearing selected as a locating bearing depends on 
the magnitude of the axial forces and the accuracy with which 
the shafts must be axially guided.
A double row angular contact ball bearing, Figure 3 , for example, 
will give closer axial guidance than a deep groove ball bearing or 
a spherical roller bearing. A pair of symmetrically arranged angular 
contact ball bearings or tapered roller bearings Figure 4, used as 
locating bearings will provide extremely close axial guidance.
Angular contact ball bearings of the universal design, Figure 5, give 
particular advantages. The bearings can be fitted in pairs in any 
O or X arrangement without shims. Angular contact ball bearings of 
the universal design are matched so that, in an X or O arrangement, 
they have a low axial internal clearance (design UA), 
zero clearance (UO) or slight preload (UL).
Spindle bearings of the universal design UL, Figure 6, have slight 
preload when fitted in an X or O arrangement (designs with higher 
preload are available by agreement).
In gearboxes, a four point contact bearing is sometimes fitted 
directly adjacent to a cylindrical roller bearing to give a locating 
bearing arrangement, Figure 3 . The four point contact bearing, 
without radial support of the outer ring, can only support axial 
forces. The radial force is supported by the cylindrical roller bearing.
If a lower axial force is present, a cylindrical roller bearing with 
cage of series NUP can also be used as a locating bearing, 
Figure 4 .
No adjustment
or setting work with matched pairs
of tapered roller bearings
Fitting is also made easier with a matched pair of tapered roller 
bearings as a locating bearing (313..-N11CA), Figure 7 . 
They are matched with appropriate axial internal clearance so that 
no adjustment or setting work is required.

Design of bearing arrangements
Adjusted bearing arrangement
An adjusted bearing arrangement generally consists of two 
symmetrically arranged angular contact ball bearings or tapered 
roller bearings, Figure 8.
During fitting, one bearing ring is displaced on its seat until 
the bearing arrangement achieves the required clearance or 
the necessary preload.
Application
Due to this adjustment facility, the adjusted bearing arrangement is 
particularly suitable where close guidance is required, for example 
in pinion bearing arrangements with spiral toothed bevel gears and 
spindle bearing arrangements in machine tools.
X and O arrangements
A fundamental distinction is drawn between the O arrangement, 
Figure 8 , and the X arrangement, Figure 8 , of the bearings. 
In the O arrangement, the cones and their apexes S formed by 
the pressure lines point outwards; in the X arrangement, the cones 
point inwards.
The support base H, in other words the distance between the apexes 
of the pressure cones, is larger in the O arrangement than in the 
X arrangement. The O arrangement therefore gives the lower tilting 
clearance.
Influence of
thermal expansion in
X and O arrangements
When setting the axial internal clearance, thermal expansion 
must be taken into consideration. In the X arrangement, Figure 9,
a temperature differential between the shaft and housing always 
leads to a reduction in the internal clearance (assuming 
the following preconditions: shaft and housing of identical material, 
inner ring and complete shaft at identical temperature, outer ring 
and complete housing at identical temperature).

In the O arrangement, a distinction is drawn between three cases:
■The apexes R of the roller cones, i.e. the intersection points of 
the extended outer ring raceway with the bearing axis, coincide: 
the required internal clearance is achieved, Figure 10 . 
■The roller cones overlap if there is a short distance 
between the bearings: 
the axial internal clearance is reduced, Figure 10 .
■The roller cones do not meet if there is a large distance 
between the bearings: 
the axial internal clearance is increased, Figure 11.
Elastic adjustment
Adjusted bearing arrangements can also be achieved by preloading 
using springs, Figure 12 . The elastic adjustment method 
compensates for thermal expansion. It can also be used where 
bearing arrangements are at risk of vibration while stationary.

Design of bearing arrangements
Floating bearing arrangement
The floating bearing arrangement is an economical solution 
where close axial guidance of the shaft is not required, Figure 13. 
The construction is similar to that of the adjusted bearing 
arrangement. 
In the floating bearing arrangement, however, the shaft can be 
displaced in relation to the housing to the extent of the axial 
clearance s. The value s is defined as a function of the required 
guidance accuracy such that the bearings are not axially preloaded 
even under unfavourable thermal conditions.
Suitable bearings
Suitable bearing types for the floating bearing arrangement include 
deep groove ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical 
roller bearings. 
In both bearings, one ring – usually an outer ring – has a fit that 
allows displacement.
In floating bearing arrangements comprising cylindrical roller 
bearings with cage of series NJ, the length compensation takes place 
within the bearings. The inner and outer rings can have tight fits, 
Figure 13 .
Tapered roller bearings and angular contact ball bearings are 
not suitable for a floating bearing arrangement, since they must be 
adjusted in order to run correctly.

Fits
Rolling bearings are located on the shaft and in the housing in 
a radial, axial and tangential direction according to their function.
Radial and tangential location is normally achieved by force locking, 
i.e. tight fits on the bearing rings. Axial location is normally achieved 
by geometrical locking, see Axial location of bearings, page 156.
Criteria for selection of fits
The following must be observed when selecting fits:
■The bearing rings must be well supported on their circumference 
in order to allow full utilisation of the load carrying capacity.
■The bearings must not creep on their mating parts, otherwise 
the seats will be damaged.
■One ring of the non-locating bearing must adapt to changes 
in shaft and housing length and must therefore be capable 
of axial displacement; it is only in cylindrical roller bearings N 
and NU that displacement occurs within the bearing.
■The bearings must be easy to fit and dismantle.
Good support of the bearing rings on their circumference requires 
rigid seating, i.e. a tight fit. The requirement that bearings must not 
creep on their mating parts also requires rigid seating.
If non-separable bearings must be fitted and dismantled, a tight fit 
cannot be achieved, at least for one ring.
In cylindrical roller bearings N and NU and needle roller bearings, 
both rings can have tight fits, since the length compensation takes 
place within the bearing and since the rings can be fitted separately.
With tight fits and a temperature differential between the inner and 
outer ring, the radial internal clearance of the bearing is reduced. 
This must be taken into consideration when selecting the internal 
clearance, Operating clearance, page 97.
Caution!
If materials other than cast iron or steel are used for the adjacent 
construction, the following must also be taken into consideration to 
achieve rigid seating: the modulus of elasticity and the differing 
coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials.
For aluminium housings, thin-walled housings and hollow shafts, 
a closer fit should be selected if necessary in order to achieve 
the same force locking as with cast iron, steel or solid shafts.
Higher loads, especially shocks, require a fit with larger interference 
and adherence to narrow geometrical tolerances.
Seats for axial bearings
Axial bearings, which can support axial loads only, must not be 
guided radially (with the exception of: axial cylindrical roller 
bearings, in which the degree of freedom in the radial direction is 
present due to the flat raceways).
In axial bearings with groove-shaped raceways, such as axial deep 
groove ball bearings, this is not present and must be achieved by 
a loose seat for the stationary washer. A rigid seat is normally 
selected for the rotating washer. 
Where axial bearings support radial forces in addition to axial 
forces, such as in axial spherical roller bearings, fits should be 
selected in the same way as for radial bearings.
The contact surfaces of the mating parts must be perpendicular 
to the axis of rotation (runout tolerance to IT5 or better), in order to 
ensure uniform load distribution over all the rolling elements.

Design of bearing arrangements
Conditions of rotation
The conditions of rotation indicate the motion of one bearing ring 
with respect to the load direction and are expressed as either 
circumferential load or point load, see table Conditions of rotation.
Point load
If the ring remains stationary relative to the load direction, 
there are no forces that displace the ring relative to its seating 
surface. This type of load is described as point load.
There is no risk that the seating surface will be damaged and a loose 
fit is possible.
Circumferential load
If forces are present that displace the ring relative to its seating sur-
face, every point on the raceway is subjected to load over the course 
of one revolution of the bearing. A load with this characteristic 
is described as a circumferential load.
Caution!
There is a risk that the seating surface will be damaged and a tight 
fit should be used.

Shaft and housing tolerances
The fit is determined by the ISO tolerances for shafts and 
housings (ISO 286), in conjunction with the tolerances 
dmp for the 
bore and 
Dmp for the outside diameter of the bearings (DIN 620). 
The ISO tolerances are defined in the form of tolerance zones. 
They are determined by their position relative to the zero 
line (= tolerance position) and their size (= tolerance grade, see 
ISO 286). The tolerance position is indicated by letters (upper case 
for housings, lower case for shafts). A schematic illustration of 
the most common rolling bearing fits is shown in Figure 14.
The tables on pages 134 to 136 contain recommendations for 
the selection of shaft and housing tolerances.

The numerical values for the fits (page 138 to page 151) are valid 
for solid steel shafts and cast iron housings. In the table header, 
below the nominal diameters, are the normal tolerances for the bore 
or outside diameters of radial bearings (excluding tapered roller 
bearings). Below these are the deviations for the most important 
tolerance zones for fitting of rolling bearings.
Shaft fits
In each cell are five numbers in accordance with the following 
scheme, for example for shaft 40 j5:
Example:

1) The probable interference of fit clearance is the value obtained if 
the actual dimensions are one third away from the maximum material values.
2) Values printed in bold type indicate fit interference.
3) Values printed in regular type indicate fit clearance.
Shaft fits: see tables from page 138.

scheme, for example for housing 100 K6:
Example:
table entry for housing fit
1) The probable interference or fit clearance is the value obtained if 
the actual dimensions are one third away from the maximum material values.
2) Values printed in bold type indicate fit interference.
3) Values printed in regular type indicate fit clearance.
Housing fits: see tables from page 147.

Design of bearing arrangements
Geometrical tolerances of
bearing seating surfaces
In order to achieve the required fit, the bearing seats/fit surfaces of 
the shaft and housing must conform to certain tolerances matched 
to the bearings, Figure 15 and table Geometrical tolerances of 
bearing seating surfaces, page 153.
Accuracy
of bearing seating surfaces
The degree of accuracy for the bearing seat tolerances on the shaft 
and in the housing is given in the tables Geometrical tolerances of 
bearing seating surfaces, page 153, and the ISO fundamental 
tolerances (ISO 286).
Second bearing seat
The tolerances for a second bearing seat on the shaft (d2) or in the 
housing (D2) – expressed in terms of coaxiality to DIN ISO 1101 – 
must be based on the angular adjustment facility of the specific 
bearing. Misalignments due to elastic deformation of the shaft and 
housing must be taken into consideration.
Housings
In split housings, the joints must be free from burrs.
The accuracy of the bearing seats is determined as a function of 
the accuracy of the bearing selected.
t1 = roundness
t2 = parallelism
t3 = runout of abutment shoulders

Geometrical tolerances of
bearing seating surfaces
Roughness of bearing seats
The roughness of the bearing seats must be matched to 
the tolerance class of the bearings. The mean roughness value Ra 
must not be too high, in order to maintain the interference loss 
within limits. Shafts should be ground and bores should be 
precision turned.
The bore and shaft tolerances and permissible roughness values 
are also given in the design and safety guidelines in the product 
sections. The guide values for roughness correspond to DIN 5 425-1.

Raceways for bearings without
inner and/or outer ring
In rolling bearings without an inner and/or outer ring as a raceway, 
the rolling elements run directly on the shaft or in the housing bore.
Caution!
The shaft and housing bore must be suitable for use as rolling 
bearing raceways.
A precision ground raceway surface without undulations is 
essential. The raceways must always be precision machined 
(grinding and honing). At a mean roughness Ra  0,2 m, it is not 
possible to utilise the full load carrying capacity of the bearings.
The additional guidelines on shaft design in the product sections 
must be observed.
The diameter tolerances of the shaft and housing determine 
the internal clearance.
Materials for raceways
Through hardening steels
Through hardening steels to ISO 683-17 (e.g. 100Cr6) are suitable 
as materials for rolling bearing raceways in direct bearing arrange-
ments. These steels can also be surface layer hardened.
Case hardening steels
Case hardening steels must conform to ISO 683-17 (e.g. 17MnCr5, 
16CrNiMo6) or EN 10 084 (e.g. 16MnCr5).
Flame or induction hardening
For flame and induction hardening, the steels used must conform to 
ISO 683-17 (e.g. Cf54, 43CrMo4) or to DIN 17 212 (e.g. Cf53).
Surface hardness and
hardening depth
Case, flame or induction hardened steels must have a surface 
hardness of 670 HV + 170 HV and an adequate hardening 
depth CHD or Rht.
The hardening depth is, according to DIN 50190, the depth of the 
hardened surface zone at which there is still a hardness of 550 HV. 
It is measured on the finish ground shaft and must correspond to 
the stated values, but must in any case be  0,3 mm.
Caution!
If the raceways are softer than 650 HV (58 HRC), the bearing 
arrangement will not achieve the full load carrying capacity. 
The basic dynamic load rating Cr and the basic static load rating C0r 
must then be reduced by the factor fH, Figure 16.

raceway hardness

Design of bearing arrangements
Axial location of bearings
Axial location of the bearing rings is matched to the specific bearing 
arrangement (locating bearing, non-locating bearing, adjusted and 
floating arrangements of bearings).
Examples: see Figure 19, page 157 to Figure 29, page 160.
Design guidelines
Bearing rings must be located by force or geometrical locking in 
order to prevent lateral movement.
The bearing rings must only be in contact with the shaft or housing 
shoulder, but not with the fillet.
Every radius of the mating part must be smaller than the smallest 
chamfer dimension r or r1 of the bearing.
The radius should have rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509.
The shoulders on the mating parts must be large enough to provide 
a sufficiently wide contact surface even with the largest chamfer 
dimension of the bearing (DIN 5 418).
The bearing tables give the maximum values for the radius ra and ra1 
and the diameter of the abutment shoulders (Da and da).
Any special characteristics of the individual bearing types, 
e.g. for needle roller bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, tapered 
roller bearings and axial bearings are indicated in the product 
sections.
Locating bearings
Locating bearings can support axial forces. The retaining element 
must be matched to these axial forces. The following are suitable: 
shoulders on shaft and housing, snap rings, housing cover, 
shaft covers, nuts, spacer rings etc.
Non-locating bearings
Non-locating bearings only need to support slight axial forces 
occurring in thermal expansion. The means of axial location only 
needs to prevent creep of the rings. A tight fit is often sufficient.
Self-retaining bearings
In non-separable bearings, only one bearing ring requires a tight fit; 
the other ring is retained by the rolling elements.

Seals
Sealing has a considerable influence on the operating life of 
a bearing arrangement. It is intended to retain the lubricant in the 
bearing and prevent the ingress of contaminants into the bearing.
Contaminants may have various effects:
■A large quantity of very small, abrasive particles causes wear in 
the bearing. The increase in the operating clearance and noise 
level then bring the operating life of the bearing to an end.
■Large, overrolled hard particles reduce the fatigue life since 
pittings occur at the indentation points under high bearing loads.
A basic distinction is made between contact and non-contact seals 
in the adjacent construction and the bearing.
Non-contact seals in
the adjacent construction
With non-contact seals, there is no friction in the lubricant gap other 
than that due to lubricant friction itself. 
The seals do not undergo wear and remain capable of operation for 
a long period. Since they generate no heat, non-contact seals are 
also suitable for very high speeds.
Gap seals
A simple design, although adequate in many cases, is a narrow seal 
gap between the shaft and housing, Figure 30.
Labyrinth seals
A considerably greater sealing effect than with gap seals is achieved 
by labyrinths incorporating gaps filled with grease, Figure 31.
In contaminated environments, grease should be pressed from 
the interior into the seal gap at short intervals.

Splash ring
Where oil lubrication is used with a horizontal shaft, splash rings are 
suitable for preventing the escape of oil, Figure 32. 
The oil outlet hole on the underside of the seal location must be 
sufficiently large that it cannot be clogged by contamination.
Flinger shields
Co-rotating flinger shields have the effect of shielding the seal gap 
from heavy contamination, Figure 33.
Baffle plates
Stationary baffle plates ensure that grease remains in the area 
around the bearing, Figure 34.
The grease collar that forms at the seal gap protects the bearing 
against contamination.

Schaeffler Group Industrial
Design of bearing arrangements
The friction in this case is as low as that in bearings with sealing 
shields. They have the advantage over these, however, that the 
outer elastic rim gives good sealing when fitted in the slot in the 
outer ring. This is important with a rotating outer ring since the base 
oil is separated from the soap suspension by centrifugal force and 
would escape through the unsealed metallic seat in the outer ring 
if sealing shields were fitted.
Contact seals in
the adjacent construction
Contact seals are in contact with the running surface under contact 
force (normally radial). The contact force should be kept small to 
avoid an excessive increase in frictional torque and temperature. 
The frictional torque and temperature as well as the wear of the seal 
are also affected by the lubrication condition at the running surface, 
its roughness and the sliding speed.
With grease lubrication
Felt rings are simple sealing elements that have proved effective 
primarily with grease lubrication, Figure 38. They are impregnated 
with oil before fitting and give particularly good sealing against dust. 
In unfavourable environmental conditions, two felt rings are 
arranged adjacent to each other. Felt rings and annular slots are 
standardised according to DIN 5 419.
With oil lubrication
If oil lubrication is used, sealing is primarily carried out with rotary 
shaft seals to DIN 3 760 and DIN 3 761, Figure 39. The seal collar 
with one lip is pressed against the shaft running surface by a spring.

If the principal objective is to prevent escape of lubricant, the lip 
is arranged on the inner side of the bearing arrangement. 
A sealing ring with an additional protective lip also prevents the 
ingress of contamination. Seal lips made from the conventional 
material nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) are suitable with 
oil lubrication for circumferential speeds up to 12 m/s.
INA sealing rings for
needle roller bearings
These compact sealing rings are matched to INA needle roller 
bearings and are suitable for circumferential speeds at the running 
surface of up to 10 m/s, Figure 40. INA inner rings are recommended 
as sealing ring raceways.
Lip seal with axial sealing action
The V ring is a lip seal with axial sealing action, Figure 41. 
During fitting, this single piece rubber ring is pushed under tension 
along the shaft until its lip is in axial contact with the housing wall. 
The seal lip acts simultaneously as a flinger shield.
Axial lip seals are unaffected by radial misalignment and slight 
skewing of the shaft.
Rotating V rings are suitable with grease lubrication for circum-
ferential speeds up to 12 m/s, stationary V rings up to 20 m/s. 
For circumferential speeds over 8 m/s, the V ring must be axially 
abutted and, from 12 m/s, it must be radially clamped in addition.
V rings are frequently used as outer seals in order to keep 
contamination away from a rotary shaft seal.

Handling
Rolling bearings are precision products. These products must be 
handled with care before and during fitting in order to maintain their 
full performance capacity.
Rolling bearings are preserved using an anti-corrosion agent with 
a mineral oil base, dry preserved using VCI paper or provided with 
a long term preservative for overseas transport.
The preservative and packaging used with rolling bearings must 
be matched to each other to maintain the characteristics of 
the bearings for as long as possible. 
Storage of rolling bearings
During storage, measures must be taken to prevent action by 
aggressive media such as gases, mist or aerosols of acids, alkalis or 
salts. Direct sunlight should also be avoided since, apart from 
the harmful effects of UV radiation, it can lead to wide temperature 
fluctuations in the packaging. 
Parts must be stored in dry, clean rooms with the temperature as 
constant as possible.
In order to prevent condensation, the following permissible 
conditions should be adhered to:
■temperature between +6 °C and +25 °C, for short periods +30 °C
■temperature differences between day and night 	 8 K
■relative humidity of max. 65%.
The storage period for greased and sealed bearings is limited by 
the shelf life of the grease and the sealing ring material.
Permissible storage periods
for rolling bearings
With normal preservation, bearings can be stored for up to 5 years 
if the above conditions are fulfilled. If the permissible storage period 
is exceeded, it is recommended that the bearing should be checked 
for preservative condition and for corrosion. By agreement, we will 
give information on the risk assessment relating to the continued 
storage or use of older bearings.
In special cases, special preservatives are used that permit shorter 
or longer storage periods than the normal preservation.
Bearings sealed on both sides with sealing shields (suffix 2Z) or 
sealing washers (suffix 2RSR) should not, where possible, be stored 
up to the limit of their normal storage capability. The greases used 
for filling may undergo changes in their chemical-physical behaviour 
during storage as a result of ageing. Even if the minimum 
performance capacity remains, the safety reserves of the grease 
may have diminished. Further relevant information is given in the 
section Lubrication.

Unpacking of rolling bearings
Perspiration from handling leads to corrosion. Hands should be kept 
clean and dry and gloves worn if necessary.
Bearings should only be removed from their original packaging 
immediately before assembly. If bearings are removed from 
multi-item packaging with dry preservation, the package must be 
closed again immediately afterwards, since the protective vapour 
phase is only effective in closed packaging.
Caution!
Bearings should be oiled or greased immediately after unpacking.
Compatibility, miscibility
The anti-corrosion agent in rolling bearings with an oil-based 
preservative is compatible and miscible with oils and greases with 
a mineral oil base. Compatibility should be checked if synthetic 
lubricants or thickeners other than lithium or lithium complex soaps 
are used.
If there is an incompatibility, the anti-corrosion oil should be 
washed out before greasing, especially in the case of lubricants 
with a PTFE/alkoxyfluoroether base and thickeners based on 
polycarbamide. Bearings should be washed out if the lubricant 
is changed or the rolling bearings are contaminated.
If in doubt, please consult the relevant lubricant manufacturer.
Cleaning of rolling bearings
Caution!
If cleaning is to be carried out, the legal regulations relating to 
environmental protection, health and safety at work etc. must be 
observed. The specifications of the cleaning agent manufacturer, 
for example on handling, must be observed. The design and safety 
guidelines in the product sections must be observed.
Cleaning should be carried out using brushes, paint brushes or lint-
free cloths. If the bearings contain resinous oil or grease residues, 
precleaning by mechanical means followed by treatment with 
an aqueous, strongly alkaline cleaning agent is recommended.
The following are suitable for degreasing and washing of rolling 
bearings:
■aqueous neutral, acidic or alkaline cleaning agents. 
Check the compatibility of alkaline agents with aluminium 
components before cleaning
■organic cleaning agents such as paraffin oil free from water and 
acid, petroleum ether (not petrol), spirit, dewatering fluids, 
freon 12 substitutes, cleaning agents containing chlorinated 
hydrocarbons.
Caution!
Paraffin oil, petroleum ether, spirit and dewatering fluids are 
flammable and alkaline agents are corrosive. The use of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons is associated with the risk of fire, explosion and 
decomposition as well as with health hazards.
These hazards and appropriate protective measures are described 
comprehensively in datasheet ZH1/425 of the Hauptverband 
der gewerblichen Berufsgenossenschaften (German Federation of 
Institutions for Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention).
Caution!
Rolling bearings must be dried and preservative applied 
immediately after cleaning – risk of corrosion.

Guidelines for fitting
■Before fitting, familiarise yourself with the design by means of 
the final assembly drawing.
■Before fitting, check whether the bearing presented for fitting 
corresponds to the data in the drawing.
■The assembly area must be kept clean and free from dust.
■Protect bearings from dust, contaminants and moisture. 
Contaminants have a detrimental influence on the running and 
operating life of rolling bearings.
■Check the housing bore and shaft seat of the axis for 
dimensional and geometrical accuracy and cleanliness.
■Wipe away any anti-corrosion agent from the seating and contact 
surfaces, wash anti-corrosion agent out of tapered bores.
■Lightly oil the bearing ring seating surfaces.
■Check that the shaft and housing bore have a lead chamfer of 
10° to 15°.
■Do not cool the bearings excessively, since moisture due to 
condensation can lead to corrosion in the bearings and bearing 
seats.
■After fitting, provide the rolling bearings with lubricant.
■Check the correct functioning of the bearing arrangement.

Heating of bearings
Bearings with a cylindrical bore should be heated before fitting if 
a tight fit on the shaft is intended and excessive effort is required for 
pressing by mechanical means. The heating temperature required 
for problem-free fitting is shown as a function of bearing bore 
diameter in Figure 5.
The data are valid for maximum fit interference, a room temperature 
of +20 °C and an excess temperature safety margin of 30 K.
Induction heating devices
Induction heating devices are particularly suitable for achieving 
rapid, safe and clean heating. These devices are used mainly in 
volume fitting work.
Heating plate
As an interim measure, individual bearings can be heated on an 
electric heating plate. The bearing is covered with a metal sheet 
and turned several times. A thermostatic controller is absolutely 
necessary.
Heating cabinet
Safe, clean heating of bearings can be carried out in a thermo-
statically controlled hot air or heating cabinet. 
This method is mainly used for small and medium sized bearings. 
The heating times are relatively long.
Oil bath
With the exception of sealed, greased bearings and high precision 
bearings, rolling bearings of all sizes and type can be heated in an 
oil bath. A thermostatic controller is advisable (temperature +80 °C 
to +100 °C). In order to achieve uniform heating, the bearings 
should be laid on a grid or suspended in the oil bath.
Caution!
Risk of accidents, environmental pollution by oil vapour, 
flammability of hot oil, risk of bearing contamination.

Fitting of rolling bearings
with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered bore are mounted either directly on 
the tapered shaft seat or by means of an adapter sleeve or extraction 
sleeve on a cylindrical shaft, Figure 6 , , .
Small bearings (with a bore of up to approx. 80 mm) are driven up 
the tapered shaft seat or adapter sleeve using a locknut. 
The tight fit is achieved by the axial pressing of the inner ring. 
The nut is tightened using, for example, a hook wrench. 
Small extraction sleeves can also be pressed into the gap between 
the shaft and inner ring bore using a locknut.
Reduction
in radial internal clearance
The reduction in radial internal clearance as a result of inner ring 
expansion is used as a means of checking the tight fit. 
In spherical roller bearings, the radial internal clearance (sr) must 
be measured simultaneously over both rows of rollers, Figure 7. 
Alternatively, the axial displacement is measured.
Values for reduction in radial internal clearance and displacement in 
spherical roller bearings: see section Spherical roller bearings.
For the measurement of radial internal clearance, aids such as feeler 
gauges FEELER.GAUGE100 and FEELER.GAUGE300 are suitable.

Even in the case of medium sized bearings, the forces required to 
tighten nuts are considerable. In such cases, fitting can be made 
easier by using locknuts with pressure screws 
(not suitable for spherical roller bearings of E1 design, Figure 8 ). 
For the fitting of large bearings, a hydraulic device should be used to 
drive up the bearing or press in the sleeve, Figure 8 . 
Hydraulic nuts are available for all common threaded sleeves and 
shafts.
Hydraulic method
The hydraulic method gives considerable assistance in the fitting 
and particularly in the dismantling of bearings with a bore of 
approx. 160 mm and above.
For fitting, an oil with a viscosity of 75 mm2/s at +20 °C
(nominal viscosity 32 mm2/s at +40 °C) is recommended.
Guidelines for dismantling
Comprehensive information on fitting and dismantling is given 
in the publications WL 80 100, Mounting of Rolling Bearings and 
WL 80 250, Equipment and Services for the Mounting and 
Maintenance of Rolling Bearings.
Dismantling should be taken into consideration in the original 
design of the bearing location. If bearing rings are to be mounted 
with a tight fit, slots should be provided in the shaft or housing bore 
to facilitate removal of the bearing rings.
If the bearing is to be reused, the following guidelines should be 
taken into consideration:
■do not use a concentrated or “hard” flame
■do not apply direct blows to the bearing rings
■do not apply fitting forces through the rolling elements
■carefully clean the bearings after dismantling.

Dismantling
of rolling bearings
on cylindrical seats
If the bearings and adjacent parts are to be reused, the extraction 
tool should be applied to the ring fitted with a tight fit.
In non-separable bearings, the ring fitted with a drive fit is 
dismantled and the ring with a tight fit is then removed.
Extraction of small bearings
For the extraction of small bearings, mechanical extraction devices, 
Figure 9 or hydraulic presses are suitable. Dismantling is made 
easier if there are extraction slots on the shaft or housing so that 
the extraction tool can be applied to the bearing ring fitted with 
a tight fit. 
Special devices are available for those cases where extraction slots 
are not present.
Extraction of inner rings using an
induction device
Induction heating devices are used mainly to extract the shrink-
fitted inner rings of cylindrical roller bearings, Figure 10.
Heating is achieved quickly and the rings are loosened easily 
without the transfer of substantial heat to the shaft.

Fitting and dismantling
Heating rings
Heating rings made from light metal with radial slots can be used 
to dismantle the inner rings of cylindrical roller bearings that have 
no ribs or only one rigid rib, Figure 11.
Heating rings are heated on an electric heating plate to between 
+200 °C and +300 °C, pushed over the bearing ring to be extracted 
and clamped in place using the grips. Once the press fit on the shaft 
has been eliminated, both rings are removed together. 
Caution!
The bearing ring must be removed from the heating ring immediately 
after extraction in order to prevent overheating.
Flames
If an induction device is not available and there are no oil ducts for 
the hydraulic method, the inner rings of separable bearings can if 
necessary be heated for extraction by means of a flame, preferably 
using a ring burner. 
Caution!
This should be done with extreme care since the rings are sensitive 
to uneven heating and localised overheating.

Dismantling of rolling
bearings with tapered bore
Mechanical dismantling
Where bearings are mounted directly on a tapered shaft seat or on 
an adapter sleeve, the locking effect of the shaft or adapter sleeve 
nut must be loosened first. The nut is then unscrewed by the amount 
of the drive-up distance. The inner ring is then driven off the sleeve 
or shaft, for example using a hammer and metal drift or impact 
block, Figure 12 , .
If an impact block is used, this avoids the risk of slipping.
Bearings located using extraction sleeves are dismantled with 
the aid of the extraction nut, Figure 12 .

Fitting and dismantling
Large bearings located using an extraction sleeve require 
considerable force. In this case, locknuts with additional pressure 
screws can be used, Figure 13 . A disc is inserted between 
the inner ring and pressure screws. 
Hydraulic dismantling
An easier and more economical method is the dismantling of 
extraction sleeves using hydraulic nuts, Figure 13 . 
The protruding extraction sleeve is supported by a heavy-section 
ring.
The dismantling of large bearings can be made easier by using 
the hydraulic method, Figure 13 , and Figure 14. Oil is pressed 
between the fit surfaces. The adjacent parts can then moved in 
relation to each other by applying only slight force and without 
the risk of surface damage. 
Tapered shafts must be provided with appropriate oil slots and feed 
holes. Oil injectors are sufficient to generate the pressure required.
Caution!
The extraction sleeve becomes loose abruptly. Leave the nut on 
the shaft.
Large adapter and extraction sleeves already have the appropriate 
slots and holes. In this case, a pump must be used to generate 
the oil pressure required.
Suitable oils
For dismantling, the oil used should have a viscosity of 
approx. 150 mm2/s at +20 °C (nominal viscosity 46 mm2/s at 
+40 °C).
Fretting corrosion can be dissolved by rust-dissolving additives in 
the oil.

Deep groove ball bearings
Features
Deep groove ball bearings are versatile, self-retaining bearings 
with solid outer rings, inner rings and ball and cage assemblies. 
These products, which are of simple design, robust in operation and 
easy to maintain, are available in single and double row designs and 
in open and sealed variants. Due to the manufacturing processes 
used, open bearings can have turned recesses in the outer ring for 
seals or shields.
Due to their low frictional torque, deep groove ball bearings are 
suitable for high speeds.
Radial and axial load capacity
Due to the raceway geometry and the balls used as rolling elements, 
deep groove ball bearings can support axial loads in both directions 
as well as radial loads. Axial load carrying capacity, page 192.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The angular adjustment facility of single row deep groove ball 
bearings is limited, so the bearing positions must be well aligned.
Misalignments can lead to unfavourable ball running and induce 
additional loads in the bearing that shorten the operating life.
In order to keep these loads at a low level, only small adjustment 
angles are permissible – dependent on the load – for single row 
deep groove ball bearings, see table Load and adjustment angle.
Caution!
Due to their internal construction, double row deep groove ball 
bearings do not have an angular adjustment facility. When using 
these bearings, therefore, misalignments are not permissible.

Deep groove ball bearings
Single row deep groove
ball bearings
Single row deep groove ball bearings are the most frequently used 
type of rolling bearing. They are produced in numerous sizes and 
designs and are particularly economical.
Sealing/lubrication
Bearings without seals are suitable for high to very high speeds.
Deep groove ball bearings with the suffix 2Z have gap seals on 
both sides. These bearings are greased using a high quality grease, 
lubricated for life and suitable for high speeds.
Bearings with the suffix 2RSR have lip seals on both sides made 
from nitrile butadiene rubber NBR. 
These designs are greased using a high quality grease, 
lubricated for life and suitable for moderate speeds.
By agreement, we can supply bearings with non-contact BRS seals 
on both sides (suffix 2BRS). The frictional behaviour of these 
bearings is just as favourable as that of bearings with Z seals. 
If the inner ring is stationary and the outer ring rotates, the lubricant 
loss is smaller than that in bearings with Z seals.
Corrosion-resistant deep groove
ball bearings
In deep groove ball bearings of series S60, S62 and S63, 
the cages and the inner and outer rings are made from corrosion-
resistant steel X70Cr13, while the balls are made from high alloy 
chromium steel X102CrMo17.
These bearings are resistant to water, water vapour, alkalis, 
photographic developers and in certain cases to acids.
Corrosion-resistant deep groove ball bearings are available in open 
and sealed designs.
In the case of bearings sealed on both sides (suffix 2RSR) in 
particular, the resistance to acids is limited by the sealing ring 
material nitrile butadiene rubber NBR.

Matched single row deep groove
ball bearings
By agreement, deep groove ball bearings of series 160, 60, 62, 63, 
64 and 618 are available in various arrangements as matched pairs 
of bearings, Figure 1.
Sets in an O arrangement (suffix DB) can support axial loads in both 
directions as well as tilting moments.
Sets in an X arrangement (suffix DF) can support axial loads in both 
directions but are not suitable for tilting moments.
For high axial loads from one direction, pairs of bearings in a tandem 
arrangement are suitable (suffix DT).
Double row deep groove
ball bearings
Double row deep groove ball bearings correspond in their structure 
and function to a pair of single row deep groove ball bearings. 
They are designed for high to very high speeds and are used where 
the load carrying capacity of single row deep groove ball bearings is 
not sufficient.
Double row deep groove ball bearings are wider than single row 
deep groove ball bearings of the same bore and outside diameter 
but have a significantly higher load carrying capacity.
Sealing/lubrication
The bearings are not sealed and are greased using a high quality 
grease.
Operating temperature
Deep groove ball bearings without seals can be used up to an 
operating temperature of +120 °C. For applications at temperatures 
above +120 °C, please contact us. Bearings with a diameter D of 
more than 240 mm are dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Deep groove ball bearings with lip seals can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +110 °C, limited by the grease and 
sealing ring material.
Bearings with gap seals can be used from –30 °C to +120 °C.
Caution!
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.

N
Axial static bearing load
F0r
N
Radial static bearing load.
Axial load carrying capacity
Deep groove ball bearings are also suitable for axial loads.
Caution!
If the bearing is subjected to high loads and high speeds, 
a reduced life as well as increased friction and bearing temperature 
must be taken into consideration.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.
Mounting dimensions
The dimension tables give the maximum radius dimension ra
and the diameters of the abutment shoulders Da, da.

Accuracy
The main dimensions of single row deep groove ball bearings 
correspond to DIN 625-1, the main dimensions of double row deep 
groove ball bearings to DIN 625-3.
The dimensional and running tolerances correspond to tolerance 
class PN to DIN 620.
The width tolerance of matched bearings is different from this 
standard: see table Width tolerance.

angular contact ball bearings
.................................................................................................................. 230
In single row angular contact ball bearings, the raceways are 
arranged such that the forces are transmitted at a particular contact 
angle – oblique to the radial plane – from one raceway to the other.
The axial load carrying capacity increases with the contact angle. 
Due to the large contact angle, single row angular contact 
ball bearings are more suitable than deep groove ball bearings for 
supporting large axial forces acting in one direction.
Single row angular contact ball bearings can support radial 
loads and unilateral axial loads. They are adjusted against a second 
bearing that provides counterguidance.
Double row
angular contact ball bearings
.................................................................................................................. 248
Double row angular contact ball bearings are similar in design to a 
pair of single row angular contact ball bearings in an O arrangement. 
In this case, the apexes of the cones formed by the ball pressure 
lines point outwards.
Double row bearings can support high radial forces as well as axial 
forces in both directions and are particularly suitable for rigid axial 
guidance arrangements.
Depending on the series, the bearings are designed with or without 
filling slots.

Single row angular contact ball bearings
Features
Single row angular contact ball bearings are self-retaining units 
with solid inner and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies with 
polyamide, sheet metal or brass cages. The raceways of the inner 
and outer rings are offset from each other along the bearing axis. 
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs. Their angular 
adjustment facility is very limited.
Many sizes of angular contact ball bearings are classified as X-life 
products. These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have an improved raceway geometry and 
optimised surfaces. This gives a significant increase in the fatigue 
limit load of the bearings. When calculating the expanded adjusted 
rating life, values up to 50% higher can thus be achieved. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be 
designed.
Radial and axial load capacity
Single row angular contact ball bearings can support axial forces in 
one direction and high radial forces. They must be axially adjusted 
against a second bearing fitted in a mirror image arrangement.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle, the higher the load to which the bearing can 
be subjected. Due to the contact angle of 40°, these bearings can 
support high axial loads.
Universal design
Single row angular contact ball bearings of universal design have 
the suffix UA, UL or UO and are intended for fitting in pairs in an X, 
O or tandem arrangement or fitting in groups. These bearings can be 
fitted in any arrangement required.
The suffix UA indicates small axial internal clearance, suffix UL 
indicates slight preload and suffix UO indicates freedom from 
clearance in an X or O arrangement.
When ordering bearings, the total quantity of bearings must be 
stated, not the number of bearing pairs or bearing groups.
Matched bearings
Sets without an intermediate ring are available in 
an O arrangement (DB), X arrangement (DF) or 
tandem arrangement (DT).
When ordering bearings, the number of sets must be stated, 
not the number of single bearings.
Sealing/lubrication
Bearings with the suffix 2RS have lip seals on both sides. RS contact 
seals are suitable for giving protection against dust, contamination 
and damp atmospheres. The bearings are greased with a high 
quality grease and are lubricated for life.
Bearings without seals or with seals on one side are not greased. 
They can be lubricated with grease or oil.
Operating temperature
Open angular contact ball bearings can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.  Bearings with a diameter 
D  240 mm are dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Caution!
Angular contact ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide are suitable for operating temperatures up to 
+120 °C, restricted by the cage material.
Sealed bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from 
–30 °C to +110 °C, restricted by the lubricant and the seal material.

Cages
Angular contact ball bearings with solid cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide have the suffix TVP or TVH.
Solid brass cages have the suffix MP.
The bearings are also available with universally applicable sheet 
steel window cages (suffix JP).
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.

Calculation of axial force
Under radial load, an internal axial force is induced in the bearing 
that must be supported by a second bearing and taken into 
consideration when calculating the equivalent bearing load.
Depending on the bearing arrangement (O or X arrangement), 
the axial force must first be determined for bearings adjusted 
clearance-free without preload, see table Load ratio and axial 
bearing load, page 236 and Figure 1, Figure 2.
The following preconditions apply:
■The radial forces act at the central pressure points and are 
positive
■Bearing A is subjected to a radial load FrA, bearing B to FrB
■F is an external axial force acting on bearing A.

Basic dynamic
and static load ratings for
bearing pairs
If two bearings of the same size and design are fitted immediately 
adjacent to each other in an O or X arrangement, the basic dynamic 
load rating Cr and basic static load rating C0r of the bearing pair are 
as follows:
■Cr = 1,625 · Cr single bearing
■C0r = 2 · C0r single bearing
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.
Speeds
For greased and sealed bearings, the speeds are lower than in 
the case of unsealed bearings.
Caution!
The limiting speeds nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.
Bearings in universal design
Bearings with the suffix UA, UL and UO can be used in an X, 
O or tandem arrangement. The operating speed of the bearing pair 
is then approximately 20% below the calculated permissible 
operating speed of the single bearing.
The limiting speed nG is possible if the less favourable thermal 
balance of the bearing pair is taken into consideration.

Accuracy
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-1.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Tolerances for
universal designs and for
matched bearings
In addition to the normal tolerance (no tolerance suffix), angular 
contact ball bearings of universal designs UO, UL or UA are also 
available by agreement in tolerance class P5 (suffix P5-UL or P5-UA).
The following exceptions apply: bore tolerances for bearings of 
all tolerance classes uniformly to P5 (no special suffix), width 
tolerances for universal bearings and matched bearings according to 
the following table:
Ring width tolerance
Axial internal clearance or
preload of universal design
The axial internal clearance and preload of series 70..-B, 72..-B
and 73..-B of universal design, in pairs in an X or O arrangement, 
are shown in the table Axial internal clearance/preload, page 239.
The axial internal clearance or freedom from clearance do not apply 
to fitted bearing pairs. If rigid fits are used, this leads to reduced 
axial internal clearance or increased preload of the bearing pair.

Double row angular contact ball bearings
Features
Double row angular contact ball bearings are units with solid inner 
and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies with polyamide, sheet 
steel or brass cages. Their construction is similar to a pair of single 
row angular contact ball bearings in an O arrangement but they are 
narrower to a certain extent.  They differ in the size of the contact 
angle and the design of the bearing rings.
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs. Due to 
the manufacturing processes used, open bearings can have turned 
recesses in the outer ring for seals or shields. Sealed bearings are 
maintenance-free and therefore allow particularly economical 
bearing arrangements.
The angular adjustment facility of the angular contact ball bearings 
is very limited.
Radial and axial load capacity
Double row angular contact ball bearings can support axial forces in 
both directions and high radial forces. They are particularly suitable 
for bearing arrangements where rigid axial guidance is required.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle ( = 25°, 35° and 45°), the higher the axial 
load to which the bearing can be subjected.
Without filling slot
Bearings of series 38..-B, 30..-B, 32..-B and 33..-B are self-retaining 
and do not have filling slots in the end faces of the bearing rings. 
The contact angle  = 25°. Their axial load carrying capacity is 
the same in both directions. These bearings are highly versatile.
With filling slot
Angular contact ball bearings of series 32 und 33 are self-retaining 
and have filling slots on one side. The contact angle  = 35°. 
Caution!
These series must be fitted such that the main load direction is 
supported by the raceways without filling slots.
With split inner ring
Bearings of series 33..-DA have a split inner ring. Due to the contact 
angle of  = 45°, they can support high axial forces in both 
directions.
The inner ring halves are matched to the particular bearing and must 
not be interchanged with those of other bearings of the same size.
Sealing/lubrication
Series 38..-B, 30..-B, 32..-B and 33..-B with suffix 2RSR are sealed 
by lip seals on both sides. Contact seals are suitable for giving 
protection against dust, contamination and damp atmospheres.
Series with the suffix 2Z have gap seals on both sides.
Sealed bearings are greased with a high quality grease and 
are lubricated for life. Bearings without seals can be lubricated with 
grease or oil.

Operating temperature
Open bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from –30 °C 
to +150 °C.
Caution!
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide
are suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C, restricted by 
the cage material.
Bearings with suffix 2RSR are suitable for operating temperatures 
up to +110 °C, restricted by the lubricant and seal material.
Cages
Bearings without a cage suffix have standard cages made from sheet 
steel.
Angular contact ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide have the suffix TVH. 
Bearings with ball-guided solid brass cages are indicated by 
the suffix M. Solid brass cages guided on the outer ring have 
the suffix MA.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Cage/bore code
1) Other cage designs available by agreement. 
In such cages, suitability for high speeds and high temperatures as well as 
the basic load ratings may differ from the values for bearings with standard 
cages.

Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.
Speeds
The reference speed nB can be exceeded up to the limiting speed nG 
if permitted by the operating conditions. If the reference speed in 
the tables is higher than the limiting speed, the higher value cannot 
be used.
In bearings with lip seals 2RSR, the speed is limited by 
the permissible sliding speed of the sealing lips, so only the limiting 
speed is given in the dimension tables.
Caution!
The limiting speed nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.

Accuracy
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-3.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Axial internal clearance
Double row angular contact ball bearings of the basic design have 
the normal axial internal clearance (CN). Bearings are available by 
agreement with an axial internal clearance larger (C3) or smaller (C2) 
than normal.
Bearings with a split inner ring are intended for higher axial loads. 
In general, they have a tighter fit than unsplit bearings. Their normal 
internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance group C3 for 
unsplit bearings.

Spindle bearings
Features
Spindle bearings are single row angular contact ball bearings, 
comprising solid inner and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies 
with solid window cages. They cannot be dismantled. The bearings 
are available in open and sealed designs.
Spindle bearings have restricted tolerances. They are particularly 
suitable for bearing arrangements with very high requirements for 
guidance accuracy and suitability for high speeds. They have proved 
extremely suitable for spindle bearing arrangements in machine 
tools.
Radial and axial load capacity
The bearings can support axial forces in one direction as well as 
radial forces. Spindle bearings used in an O or X arrangement can 
support axial forces in both directions and moments. Bearings in 
a tandem arrangement can only support axial loads in one direction.
Spindle bearings are available with a contact angle  = 15° (suffix C) 
or  = 25° (suffix E).
Standard spindle bearings
Standard spindle bearings B70, B719 and B72 have steel balls.
With ceramic balls
Spindle bearings HCB70, HCB719 and HCB72 have balls in 
standard sizes made from ceramic (hybrid bearings).
Sealing/lubrication
Spindle bearings B70..-2RSD, B719..-2RSD, B72..-2RSD, 
HCB70..-2RSD, HCB719..-2RSD and HCB72..-2RSD are sealed 
on both sides by gap seals. They are greased with a 
FAG polycarbamide grease and are maintenance-free.
High speed spindle bearings
High speed spindle bearings HSS70 and HSS719 have smaller 
steel balls.
With ceramic balls
High speed spindle bearings HCS70 and HCS719 with ceramic 
balls (hybrid bearings) are also available.
These four series thus achieve higher speeds, have lower friction 
and heat generation, place less strain on the lubricant and have 
a longer operating life.
Sealing/lubrication
The bearings are sealed on both sides by gap seals. 
They are greased with a FAG polycarbamide grease and are 
maintenance-free.
Unsealed bearings of series HS70 and HS719 as well as HC70 and 
HC719 are also available.
X-life ultra bearings
X-life ultra bearings have bearing rings made from a corrosion-
resistant steel that contains nitrogen and has a particularly fine 
structure (prefix X) and ceramic balls. They fulfil very high 
requirements for speed and load carrying capacity. The bearings 
have longer life compared to conventional bearings. Most series of 
spindle bearings are available as X-life ultra bearings.

Spindle bearings
Universal designs
Spindle bearings of universal design are intended for mounting in 
pairs or groups in X, O or tandem arrangements.
Bearings with the suffix UL are designed for slight preload in an 
X or O arrangement.
Caution!
The preload is altered by mounting and the operating conditions.
Ordering data
When ordering, the number of individual bearings must be stated.
Operating temperature
Caution!
The bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from –30 °C to 
+100 °C, restricted by the seal and cage material.
The operating temperature must be taken into consideration when 
selecting the lubricant.
Cages
Spindle bearings have solid window cages made from laminated 
fabric or high performance plastic (suffix T). The cage is guided on 
the outer ring.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of the seal or cage material to 
synthetic greases and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
the cages and seals at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Suffixes
Suffixes for the available designs: see table.

Equivalent
static bearing load
For bearings under static loading, the following applies:
Bearings with contact angle 15°
Bearings with contact angle 25°
Static load safety factor
In order to achieve sufficiently smooth running, a static load safety 
factor S0  3 is necessary.
C0r
N
Basic static load rating according to dimension tables.
If using several bearings, C0r = i · C0r single bearing, i = number of single bearings
P0
N
Equivalent static load.
Speeds
The speeds of the bearing arrangements are dependent on:
■the preload of the bearings
■the elastic or rigid arrangement of the bearings in the spindle
■mounting as single bearings or in pairs
■the lubricants
■the cooling of the bearings.
Caution!
The speeds stated in the dimension tables are guide values for 
single bearings under elastic preload and low loads.
The limiting speeds nG in the dimension tables apply for lubrication 
with grease or for minimal quantity lubrication with oil and must not 
be exceeded.
For a more detailed description, see Catalogue AC 41 130, 
Super Precision Bearings.
Bearing sets
Universal bearings of the same sort (same bore and outside 
diameter) are available as sets. They can be used in any 
arrangement (O, X, tandem) as shown on page 278, Figure 1 to 
Figure 3.
Sets with slight preload have the following designations:
■duplex; suffix DUL (2 bearings)
■triplex; suffix TUL (3 bearings)
■quadruplex; suffix QUL (4 bearings).
Ordering data
When ordering bearings, the number of sets must be stated, 
not the number of single bearings.

Four point contact bearings
Features
Four point contact bearings are single row angular contact ball 
bearings and therefore require significantly less space in an axial 
direction than double row designs.
The bearings comprise solid outer rings, split inner rings and ball 
and cage assemblies with brass or polyamide cages. The two-piece 
inner rings allow a large complement of balls to be accommodated. 
The inner ring halves are matched to the particular bearing and must 
not be interchanged with those of other bearings of the same size. 
The outer ring with the ball and cage assembly can be mounted 
separately from the two inner ring halves.
Axial load capacity
in both directions
Due to the design of the rolling element raceways with their high 
raceway shoulders, the contact angle of 35° and the large number 
of rolling elements, four point contact bearings have a high load 
carrying capacity. They can support high axial forces in both 
directions as well as small radial loads.
With or without retaining slots
in the outer ring
Single row four point contact bearings capable of supporting axial 
loads in both directions are often combined with a radial bearing 
and used as an axial bearing with radial clearance in a housing. 
For quick and secure location, larger four point contact bearings 
therefore have two retaining slots in the outer ring offset by 180°. 
These bearings have the suffix N2.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The possible skewing of the inner rings in relation to the outer ring 
depends on the bearing load, the operating clearance and 
the bearing size and is very small. Four point contact bearings 
are not therefore suitable for the compensation of angular 
misalignments in housing bores or due to shaft deflections.
Skewing of the bearing rings increases the running noise, 
places increased strain on the cages and has a harmful influence 
on the operating life of the bearings.
Sealing/lubrication
Four point contact bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Operating temperature
Bearings with solid brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C. 
Bearings with an outside diameter of more than 240 mm are 
dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Caution!
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.
Cages
The standard cages for four point contact bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code, page 318.
Four point contact bearings with brass cages have the suffix MPA. 
These window cages are guided on the outer ring.
Cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are indicated by 
the suffix TVP.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.

Minimum axial load
In order to ensure low friction in the bearing, especially at high 
speeds, a minimum axial load is required. In order to prevent an 
excessive increase in friction, the axial force should be sufficiently 
high that the rolling bearings are in contact with the inner and outer 
ring raceway at only one point. This is ensured if Fa  1,2 · Fr.
Application as
axial bearings only
If four point contact bearings are to be used as axial bearings only, 
the outer ring must have a large radial clearance in the housing. 
As a result, the bearings are not subjected to radial load.
Speeds
High speeds can be achieved if four point contact ball bearings are 
subjected to purely axial load.
ISO 15 312 does not give thermal reference speeds for these 
bearings.
Caution!
The dimension tables therefore only state limiting speeds nG. 
These values are for oil lubrication and must not be exceeded. 
If higher speeds are required, please contact us.
Mounting dimensions
The shoulders on the adjacent construction (shaft/housing) must be 
sufficiently high that adequate abutment surfaces are ensured even 
with very large chamfer dimensions.
The maximum values for the radii ra and the diameters of 
the abutment surfaces da, Da are indicated in the dimension tables.
Accuracy
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-4.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Axial internal clearance
The axial internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance 
group CN.

Self-aligning ball bearings
Features
Self-aligning ball bearings are double row, self-retaining units 
comprising outer rings with a concave raceway, inner rings with 
a cylindrical or tapered bore and ball and cage assemblies. 
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs.
Radial and axial load capacity
Self-aligning ball bearings can support axial forces in both 
directions as well as radial forces.
With cylindrical/tapered bore
Bearings of series 12, 13, 22 and 23 are available with a cylindrical 
or tapered bore.
Bearings with a tapered bore have a bore taper of 1:12 and 
the suffix K.
With adapter sleeve
Self-aligning ball bearings with a tapered bore are also available 
with an adapter sleeve, locknut and tab washer. 
Adapter sleeves must be ordered in addition to the bearing.
With extended inner ring
Bearings of series 112 have an extended inner ring, a location slot 
on one side of the inner ring and are located by means of dowel pins.
These bearings are intended for simple bearing arrangements with 
conventional shafts. Due to the bearing bore tolerance (J7), they are 
very easy to fit.
Sealing/lubrication
Self-aligning ball bearings of series 12, 13, 22 and 23 are also 
available in sealed designs. Sealed bearings have contact seals on 
both sides and the suffix 2RS.
They are greased with a high quality grease and are 
maintenance-free.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
Under normal operating conditions and with a rotating inner ring, 
self-aligning ball bearings can swivel approx. 4° about their central 
position; sealed bearings can swivel by max. 1,5°. As a result, 
they permit skewing between the inner and outer ring and can 
thus compensate misalignments, shaft deflections and housing 
deformations.
If the outer ring rotates or the inner ring undergoes tumbling 
motion, the angular adjustment facility is smaller. In this case, 
please contact us.
Operating temperature
Open bearings with brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
Caution!
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.
Sealed self-aligning ball bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +100 °C, restricted by the grease and 
seal material.

Self-aligning ball bearings
Cages
The standard cages for self-aligning ball bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code.
Self-aligning ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide 66 have the suffix TVH.
Ball-guided solid brass cages are indicated by the suffix M.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and oils and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Cage/bore code
1) Other cage designs available by agreement. In such cages, suitability for 
high speeds and temperatures as well as the basic load ratings may differ from 
the values for bearings with standard cages.

Minimum load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to sufficient load. If insufficient load is applied – 
for example at high speeds during a test run – slippage can occur 
that may lead under conditions of inadequate lubrication to bearing 
damage.
The minimum load should be P/Cr = 0,01.
Speeds
Caution!
If the reference speed nB in the dimension tables is higher than 
the limiting speed nG, the higher value cannot be used.
In bearings with contact seals (suffix 2RS), the speed is limited by 
the permissible sliding speed of the sealing lips, so only the limiting 
speed nG is given in the tables.
Mounting dimensions
The dimension tables give the maximum radius dimension ra and 
the diameters of the abutment shoulders.
When fitting self-aligning ball bearings with adapter sleeves, 
attention must be paid to the dimensions of the support ring.

Projecting balls in bearings
with brass cage
In some bearings with a brass cage, the balls project to 
a certain extent at the sides. The projection C1 must be taken into 
consideration when designing the adjacent construction. 
The projection is larger in the following bearings according to 
the table, Figure 1:
Ball projection
Location
Series 112
These bearings are axially located by means of dowel pins that 
engage in the slot in the inner ring, Figure 2. These also prevent 
the inner rings creeping on the shaft.
If a shaft is to be supported by two bearings, the locating slots must 
be arranged on the sides of the bearing facing towards or away from 
each other, Figure 2.

Bearings with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered inner ring bore are:
■located either directly on tapered shaft seats or
■located on a cylindrical shaft seat using an adapter sleeve, 
locknut and tab washer.
If high axial forces are present, a support ring can be used. 
For fitting, attention must be paid to the dimensions on the support 
ring according to the dimension tables.
Accuracy
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 630. 
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
In series 112, the bearing bore tolerance is J7.

Cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings
with cage
.................................................................................................................. 358
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage have a very high 
radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for higher speeds 
compared to full complement designs. The rollers are guided 
between rigid ribs in one of the two bearing rings and form a unit 
with this ring due to the cage. Since a bearing ring of this type can 
be removed, the rings can be mounted separately. The bearings are 
available as non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Low friction
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 402
In the low friction cylindrical roller bearings, a brass disc cage or 
plastic spacers prevent the rolling elements from coming into 
contact with each other. They combined the advantages of full 
complement cylindrical roller bearings (high load carrying capacity) 
with those of cage type bearings (high limiting speeds). 
The frictional torque is very low across the entire speed range. 
As a result, the bearings have the highest limiting speeds of any 
cylindrical roller bearings.
High precision
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 414
Cylindrical roller bearings of this design are double row precision 
bearings (non-locating bearings) for machine tools and correspond 
to tolerance class SP. They are used to give radial support for main 
spindles. The bearings are separable and are therefore easier 
to fit and dismantle. The inner ring has a tapered bore for optimum 
setting of the radial internal clearance.
Full complement
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 428
These single and double row bearings have full complement rolling 
element sets. The rolling elements are guided by ribs on the bearing 
rings. Since they have the maximum possible number of rollers, 
full complement bearings have extremely high load carrying 
capacity and high rigidity. Due to the kinematic conditions, however, 
they do not achieve the high speeds that are possible when using 
cylindrical roller bearings with cage. The bearings are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Full complement
cylindrical roller bearings
with snap ring grooves
.................................................................................................................. 452
Due to the grooves in the outer rings, the bearing rings can be axially 
located using retaining rings. The bearings are therefore highly 
suitable for cable sheave bearing arrangements. Sealing rings 
on both sides of the bearings protect the running system reliably 
against contamination and moisture. Since it has the maximum 
possible number of rollers, the full complement design has 
extremely high load carrying capacity and high rigidity and is 
suitable for particularly compact designs.

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Features
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage are units comprising 
solid inner and outer rings and cylindrical roller and cage 
assemblies. The outer rings have rigid ribs on both sides or no ribs, 
the inner rings have one or two rigid ribs or are designed without 
ribs. The cage prevents the cylindrical rollers from coming into 
contact with each other during rolling.
The cylindrical roller bearings have high rigidity, high radial load 
carrying capacity and, due to the cage, are suitable for higher 
speeds compared to full complement designs. Bearings with 
the suffix E have a higher capacity roller set and are thus designed 
for very high load carrying capacity.
The bearings are separable and are therefore easier to fit and 
dismantle. Both bearing rings can be given a tight fit by this process.
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Sealing/lubricant
The bearings are supplied without seals. They can be lubricated 
from the end faces.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. 
These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, these bearings have higher load carrying 
capacity and longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be 
designed.
Non-locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings NU and N are non-locating bearings and 
can support radial forces only.
In series NU, the outer ring has two ribs, while the inner ring has no 
ribs. Bearings of series N have two ribs on the inner ring and an outer 
ring without ribs.
Axial displacement
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other from the central position by the values “s” stated in 
the dimension tables.
Semi-locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings NJ are semi-locating bearings. 
Semi-locating bearings can support not only high radial forces but 
also axial forces in one direction and can therefore guide shafts 
axially in one direction. They act as non-locating bearings in 
the opposite direction.
The bearings have two ribs on the outer ring and one rib on 
the inner ring.
Non-locating bearings
with L-section ring
Non-locating bearings NU can be combined with an L-section ring HJ 
to form a semi-locating bearing unit.
Caution!
Bearings NU must not be installed with two L-section rings – 
there is a risk of jamming.
Axial displacement
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings NUP and NJ with HJ are locating bearings. 
Locating bearings can support not only high radial forces but also 
axial forces in both directions and can therefore guide shafts axially 
in both directions.
Bearings with rib washer
Type NUP has two ribs on the outer ring and one rigid rib on 
the inner ring. A loose rib washer is fitted on the opposite side.
Bearings with L-section ring
Type NJ with HJ has two ribs on the outer ring, one rib on the inner 
ring and an L-section ring for the ribless side of the inner ring. 
The L-section rings suitable for the bearings are indicated in 
the dimension tables. The bearing and L-section ring must be 
ordered separately.
L-section rings
L-section rings are advantageous where, under high loads, 
the seating surface of the inner ring in NUP bearings with a loose rib 
washer is too small to provide a sufficiently high bearing seat. 
In some applications, they make it easier to fit and dismantle 
the bearings.
Operating temperature
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage can be used at 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C. 
For continuous operating temperatures above +120 °C, 
please contact us.
Caution!
Bearings with a plastic cage (suffix TVP2) are suitable up to +120 °C; 
the operating life is heavily dependent on the lubricant used.
Cages
Suffix M1 indicates bearings with brass cages guided by rollers.
Higher strength cylindrical roller bearings with the suffix TVP2 have 
a cage made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide PA66.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.
The cages used in the bearings are shown in the table Bearing series 
and cage material, page 363.
Other cage designs
Other cage designs available by agreement. In such cages, 
suitability for high speeds and temperatures as well as the basic 
load ratings may differ from the values for bearings with standard 
cages.

Permissible skewing
The permissible skewing of the inner ring relative to the outer ring 
is dependent on the load ratio Cr/P and is restricted to a few angular 
minutes.
Caution!
At a ratio Cr/P  5 (P/Cr 	 0,2), the adjustment angle must be no 
than 4 angular minutes (approx. 1,2 mrad).

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Axial load carrying capacity
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on:
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements,
■the sliding velocity at the ribs,
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Caution!
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this case.
The axial limiting load Fa max must not be exceeded, in order to avoid 
impermissible pressure at the contact surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4. Continuous axial loading 
without simultaneous radial loading is not permissible.

Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
Features
Low friction cylindrical roller bearings LSL and ZSL are of a single 
row, self-retaining design and correspond to dimension series 23. 
The bearings have solid outer rings with two ribs, the inner rings are 
designed with one rib. The inner ring is removable and thus allows 
easier mounting of the bearings. The disc cages or spacers prevent 
the cylindrical rollers from coming into contact with each other 
during rolling.
Cylindrical roller bearings NJ23..-E and spherical roller 
bearings 223..-E1 have the same design envelope as LSL1923 and 
ZSL1923.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. These bearings are 
indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, these bearings have higher load carrying 
capacity and longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can 
be designed.
Semi-locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings LSL1923 and ZSL1923 are semi-locating 
bearings and can support not only high radial forces but also large 
axial forces in one direction. They act as non-locating bearings in 
the opposite direction.
Since they have a larger number of rolling elements and larger rolling 
elements, LSL and ZSL bearings have higher radial and axial load 
carrying capacity than all comparable cylindrical roller bearing 
designs with a solid cage. They can withstand high shock loads and 
vibrations, support large centrifugal forces and allow accelerations 
up to 500 m/s2.
Due to the low frictional torque across the entire speed range and 
the low heat generation, the bearings have the highest limiting 
speeds of all cylindrical roller bearings. In addition, the optimum 
heat dissipation ensures thermally stable conditions in the bearing.
With disc cage
In cylindrical roller bearings LSL1923, an externally-guided flat 
brass disc cage prevents the cylindrical rollers from coming into 
contact with each other during rolling.
The cage has pockets to accommodate the rolling elements. 
The rolling elements are guided between the ribs on the outer ring. 
Due to its low mass, the cage is subjected to only minimal strain 
under acceleration. It therefore fulfils ideally its role as an element 
separating the rolling elements and supporting the inertia forces.
Lubricant is exchanged via axial through holes. Good oil flow 
through the axially open bearing is supported by the axial holes.
The outer ring is axially split and held together by fasteners.
Axial displacement
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are open on both sides. 
They can be lubricated via the end faces.

Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
With spacers
In cylindrical roller bearings ZSL1923, plastic spacers prevent 
the cylindrical rollers from coming into contact with each other 
during rolling.
The spacers are designed such that the rolling element set is self-
retaining, so the bearing and inner ring can be mounted separately.
The spacers are guided axially between the two outer ring ribs.
Axial displacement
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are open on both sides. 
They can be lubricated via the end faces.
Special design for
vibratory machinery
In addition to high basic dynamic load ratings and thus long life 
values, bearings in vibratory machinery must also be able to 
compensate or support considerable shaft tilting due to load or 
misalignment. The bearings LSL and ZSL are therefore also available 
by agreement in the BIR design. In these bearings, the inner ring 
raceway is ground slightly spherical.
Operating temperature
Cylindrical roller bearings with disc cage or spacers are suitable for 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +120 °C.

Design and
safety guidelines
Axial load carrying capacity
Radial cylindrical roller bearings of a semi-locating bearing design 
can support axial forces in one direction as well as radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on: 
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Caution!
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this case.
The axial limiting load Fa max according to the formula must not be 
exceeded, in order to avoid impermissible pressure at the contact 
surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4.
Continuous axial loading without simultaneous radial loading is not 
permissible.

Equivalent
dynamic bearing load
Non-locating bearings
For bearings under dynamic loading, the following applies:
Semi-locating bearings
If an axial force Fa is present in addition to the radial force Fr, 
the effect on the life must be calculated using our calculation 
program BEARINX®.
Equivalent
static bearing load
Non-locating bearings
For bearings under static loading, the following applies:
Semi-locating bearings
If an axial force F0a is present in addition to the radial force F0r, 
the effect on the static load safety factor must be calculated using 
our calculation program BEARINX®.
Minimum radial load
In continuous operation, a minimum radial load of the order of 
C0r/P  60 is necessary.
Caution!
If C0r/P  60, please contact us.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must be 
located by force or physical locking means.
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulder 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509. Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in 
the dimension tables.
For semi-locating bearings, the bearings only require support on 
one side, on the rib supporting the axial load.
Caution!
Full support must be provided for ribs transmitting forces in axially 
loaded bearings.

High precision cylindrical roller bearings
Features
Cylindrical roller bearings of this design are double row precision 
bearings for machine tools. They allow radially rigid, high precision 
bearing arrangements and are principally used to give radial support 
for main spindles.
The bearings comprise solid outer rings without ribs, solid inner 
rings with three ribs and cylindrical roller and cage assemblies 
with solid brass cages. For optimum setting of the radial internal 
clearance, the inner ring has a tapered bore with a bore taper 1:12. 
The cylindrical roller bearings are separable and are therefore easier 
to fit and dismantle. Both bearing rings can be given a tight fit by this 
process.
For details of other high precision cylindrical roller bearings, 
see catalogue AC 41130, Super Precision Bearings.
Non-locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings NN30..-AS-K-M-SP are non-locating 
bearings and can support radial forces only. Axial forces are 
normally supported by double direction axial angular contact ball 
bearings.
Axial displacement
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other from the central position by the values “s” stated in 
the dimension tables.
Sealing/lubricant
The bearings are supplied without seals. They can be lubricated 
from the end faces as well as through a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes in the outer ring.
Operating temperature
Cylindrical roller bearings with special precision (SP) can be used at 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
Caution!
For continuous operation above +120 °C, please contact us.
Cage
The cylindrical roller bearings have two roller-guided solid brass 
cages.

The deviation of the taper angle of the shaft seat for bearings of 
tolerance class SP is shown in the table.
Deviation of taper angle
The taper angle tolerance ATD applies vertical to the axis and 
is defined as the differential diameter.
If FAG taper gauges MGK132 are used, the ATD values listed should 
be halved (inclination angle tolerance).
For taper lengths with nominal dimensions between the values 
listed in the table, the taper angle tolerance ATD should be 
determined by means of interpolation.
Calculation example
Taper length of shaft seat 50 mm, tolerance class SP.

Full complement cylindrical roller bearings
Features
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings have solid outer and 
inner rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. Since they have 
the maximum possible number of rolling elements, these bearings 
have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and high rigidity 
and are suitable for particularly compact designs. Due to the 
kinematic conditions, however, they do not achieve the high speeds 
that are possible when using cylindrical roller bearings with cage.
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings as well as in 
single and double row designs.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. 
These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, they have higher load carrying capacity and 
longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain applications, 
this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be designed.
Non-locating bearings
Bearings SL0248 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNCL 48..V) 
and bearings SL0249 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNCL 49..V) 
are double row non-locating bearings and can support radial forces 
only.
Axial displacement
The outer ring without ribs can be axially displaced in both 
directions in relation to the inner ring. The inner ring has ribs on 
both sides.
Caution!
The bearings are held together in handling and transport by 
a transport and mounting retaining device. This retaining device 
must not be subjected to axial load.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease. For lubrication, they have 
a lubrication groove and lubrication holes in the outer ring.
Semi-locating bearings
Semi-locating bearings are available in single row design as 
SL1818 (dimension series 18), SL1829 (dimension series 29), 
SL1830 (dimension series 30), SL1822 (dimension series 22), 
SL1923 (dimension series 23) 
and in double row design as SL1850 (dimension series 50). 
They can support not only high radial forces but also axial forces in 
one direction and can therefore guide shafts axially in one direction. 
They act as non-locating bearings in the opposite direction.
Series SL1923 has only one rib on the inner ring. As a result, 
the inner ring can be removed from the bearing. This makes fitting 
and dismantling considerably easier.
Caution!
The bearings SL1818, SL1829, SL1830, SL1822 and SL1850 are 
held together in handling and transport by a transport and mounting 
retaining device.
This retaining device must not be subjected to axial load.
Axial displacement of
inner ring
The inner ring can be axially displaced in one direction only by 
the dimension “s” stated in the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease. The semi-locating bearings 
can be lubricated via the end faces, while the double row designs 
can additionally be lubricated via a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes in the outer ring.

Full complement cylindrical roller bearings
Locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings SL0148 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: 
NNC 48..V) and SL0149 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNC 49..V) 
are double row locating bearings. These bearings can support axial 
forces from both directions as well as radial forces.
Caution!
The outer ring has ribs on both sides, is axially split and held 
together by fasteners. The inner ring has an additional central rib.
The fasteners must not be subjected to axial load.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease.
For lubrication, the outer ring has a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes.
Operating temperature
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +120 °C.

Design and
safety guidelines
Axial load carrying capacity
Radial cylindrical roller bearings used as semi-locating and locating 
bearings can support axial forces in one or both directions in 
addition to radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on: 
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and the end 
faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Caution!
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending stresses may 
occur as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this 
case. The axial limiting load Fa max according to the formula must not 
be exceeded, in order to avoid impermissible pressure at the contact 
surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4. Continuous axial loading 
without simultaneous radial loading is not permissible.

Equivalent
dynamic bearing load
Non-locating bearings
For bearings under dynamic loading, the following applies:
Semi-locating
and locating bearings
If an axial force Fa is present in addition to the radial force Fr, 
the effect on the life must be calculated using our calculation 
program BEARINX®.
Equivalent
static bearing load
Non-locating bearings
For bearings under static loading, the following applies:
Semi-locating
and locating bearings
If an axial force F0a is present in addition to the radial force F0r, 
the effect on the static load safety factor must be calculated using 
our calculation program BEARINX®.
Minimum radial load
In continuous operation, a minimum radial load of the order of 
C0r/P  60 is necessary.
Caution!
If C0r/P  60, please contact us.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must be 
located by force or physical locking means.
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulders 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509. Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in 
the dimension tables.
For semi-locating bearings, the bearings only require support on 
one side, on the rib supporting the axial load.
Caution!
Full support must be provided for ribs transmitting forces in axially 
loaded bearings.

Full complement cylindrical roller bearings 
with snap ring grooves
Features
Cylindrical roller bearings with snap ring grooves are full 
complement, double row units comprising solid outer and 
inner rings with ribs, rib-guided cylindrical rollers and sealing rings. 
The outer rings have grooves for retaining rings. 
The inner rings are axially split, 1 mm wider than the outer rings 
and held together by a rolled-in steel strip.
The bearings are available as a light series SL04..-PP and 
in the dimension series 50 as SL0450..-PP. 
Locating bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings with snap ring grooves are locating 
bearings.  These bearings are very rigid and can support axial forces 
in both directions as well as high radial forces.
Due to their full complement design, they have the maximum 
possible number of rolling elements and therefore the maximum 
basic dynamic and static load ratings. Due to the kinematic 
conditions, however, they do not achieve the high speeds that are 
possible when using cylindrical roller bearings with cage.
Bearings for cable sheaves
Due to the grooves in the outer rings, the bearing rings can easily be 
axially located. The bearings are therefore highly suitable for cable 
sheave bearing arrangements.
Sealing/lubricant
Sealing rings on both sides protect the running system against 
contamination and moisture.
The cylindrical roller bearings are greased with a lithium complex 
soap grease to GA08 and can be relubricated via the outer and 
inner ring.
Operating temperature
Caution!
The cylindrical roller bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –20 °C to +80 °C, limited by the grease and 
the seal material.

Full complement cylindrical roller bearings
with snap ring grooves
Design and
safety guidelines
Radial location
The bearings normally have a circumferential load on 
the outer ring – for example in cable sheaves. The outer ring must 
therefore have a press fit.
Axial location
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulder 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509.
Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in the dimension 
tables.
Caution!
The split inner ring must be axially located on both sides, Figure 1. 
The fasteners on the split inner ring must not be subjected to axial 
load.
Location by retaining rings
The grooves allow the outer rings to be axially located using 
retaining rings, Figure 1. Suitable fasteners are WRE rings or rings 
to DIN 471. Locating rings are not included in the delivery. 
The design 2NR is supplied with two retaining rings WRE packed 
loose.
Support of sealing rings
The sealing rings must be supported to a sufficient height, so that 
they are not pressed out during lubrication of the bearings, Figure 2. 
The dimension d2 given in the dimension table must be observed.

Fitting and dismantling
Caution!
During fitting and dismantling of the bearings, the mounting forces 
must never be directed through the rolling elements, sealing rings or 
the fasteners on the split inner ring.
Accuracy
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620.
Radial internal clearance
The radial internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance 
group CN.

Tapered roller bearings
Features
Tapered roller bearings comprise solid inner and outer rings 
with tapered raceways and tapered rollers with cages made from 
pressed sheet steel. The bearings are not self-retaining. 
As a result, the inner ring with the rollers and the cage can be fitted 
separately from the outer ring.
Radial and axial load capacity
Tapered roller bearings can support axial forces in one direction 
and high radial forces. They must normally be axially adjusted 
against a second bearing fitted in a mirror image arrangement. 
This bearing combination is fitted in an O or X arrangement, 
Figure 1, Figure 2, page 467.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle, the higher the axial load to which 
the bearing can be subjected. The bearing-specific value e in 
the dimension tables indicates the contact angle and therefore 
the load carrying capacity. Bearings of series 313, 323..-B, T5ED 
and T7FC have a very high axial load carrying capacity due to their 
particularly large contact angle.
Matched bearings
Tapered roller bearings 313..-N11CA are matched in pairs in 
an X arrangement and can therefore support high axial forces in both 
directions and moment loads.
The axial internal clearance of the bearing pair is defined by 
a ring between the two outer rings and is indicated in the suffix, 
see Axial internal clearance, page 474.
Speeds for matched bearings: see page 470.
When ordering matched bearings, please state the number of 
bearings, not the number of bearing pairs.
Metric and inch sizes
Tapered roller bearings are available in metric and inch sizes.
Bearings with a K in the designation are inch sizes.
For new designs, bearings in metric sizes should be used in 
preference.
Sealing/lubrication
Tapered roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The modified line contact between the tapered rollers and 
the raceways ensures optimum stress distribution at the contact 
points, prevents edge stresses and allows the bearings to undergo 
angular adjustment.
At a load ratio P/Cr 	 0,2, the tilting of the bearing rings relative 
to each other must not exceed a maximum of 4 angular minutes. 
For higher loads or tilting angles, please contact us.

Tapered roller bearings
Operating temperature
Tapered roller bearings can be used at operating temperatures from 
–30 °C to +120 °C.
Bearings with an outside diameter of more than 90 mm are 
dimensionally stable up to +150 °C, bearings with an outside 
diameter of more than 120 mm up to +200 °C.
Cages
Tapered roller bearings have pressed cages made from sheet steel. 
Since these project laterally to a certain extent, the mounting 
dimensions in the dimension tables and the cage projection, 
page 470, must be observed.
Suffixes
Suffixes for available designs: see table.
Available designs
1) Available by agreement and in certain series only.
Design and
safety guidelines
Calculation of axial force
Under radial load, an internal axial force is induced in the bearing 
that must be supported by a second bearing and taken into 
consideration when calculating the equivalent bearing load.
Depending on the bearing arrangement (O or X arrangement), 
the axial force must first be determined for bearings adjusted 
clearance-free without preload, see table Load ratio and axial 
bearing load, Figure 1, Figure 2, page 467.
The following preconditions apply:
■The radial forces act at the central pressure points and are 
positive,
■Bearing A is subjected to a radial load FrA, bearing B to FrB
■F is an external axial force acting on bearing A.

Tapered roller bearings
Basic dynamic and
static load ratings for
bearing pairs
If two bearings of the same size and design are fitted immediately 
adjacent to each other in an O or X arrangement, the basic dynamic 
load rating Cr and basic static load rating C0r of the bearing pair are 
as follows:
■Cr = 1,715 · Cr single bearing
■C0r = 2 · C0r single bearing
Matched bearings
For matched bearing pairs 313..-N11CA, the basic dynamic and 
static load ratings are given in the dimension tables.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for roller bearings with cage.
Speeds
Caution!
The limiting speeds nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.
Matched bearings
For matched bearings 313..-N11CA, the operating speed is 
approximately 20% below the calculated permissible operating 
speed of the single bearing.
The limiting speed nG is possible if the less favourable 
thermal balance of the bearing pair is taken into consideration in 
the operating conditions.
Cage projection
Caution!
The cages project laterally to a certain extent. In order to prevent 
grazing, the lateral minimum distances Ca and Cb in the dimension 
tables must be taken into consideration in the design of the adjacent 
construction.

Tapered roller bearings
Outer ring tolerances
Chamfer dimensions for
bearings in inch sizes
The values for the chamfer dimensions r apply to tapered roller 
bearings in inch sizes. Values for metric tapered roller bearings: 
see page 123.
Limit values
for chamfer dimensions rmax
for the inner ring
1) rmin: see dimension tables.
Limit values
for chamfer dimensions rmax
for the outer ring
1) rmin: see dimension tables.
Axial internal clearance
In tapered roller bearings, the axial internal clearance is the result of 
mounting against a second bearing during installation.
Matched bearings
The axial internal clearance is defined by an intermediate ring and 
is indicated in the suffix. Example: A80-120 indicates that the axial 
internal clearance of the bearing pair before fitting is between 
80 m and 120 m.
Once bearing pairs are fitted, the preset axial internal clearance 
is reduced by the fit conditions and the axial clamping forces.

Barrel roller bearings
Features
Barrel roller bearings are single row, self-aligning roller bearings. 
They comprise solid outer rings with a concave raceway, solid inner 
rings with two ribs and a cylindrical or tapered bore as well as barrel 
rollers with cages. The bearings cannot be dismantled.
Barrel roller bearings are particularly suitable where high radial 
shock type loads occur and misalignments must be compensated, 
see Compensation of angular misalignments. 
They have only a low axial load carrying capacity.
With tapered bore/
with adapter sleeve
Bearings with a tapered bore have a bore taper of 1:12 and 
the suffix K.
These bearings are also available with an adapter sleeve for 
location. The adapter sleeves are included in the dimension tables 
and must be specified in addition when ordering.
Sealing/lubrication
Barrel roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
Under normal operating conditions and with a rotating inner ring, 
barrel roller bearings can swivel approx. 4° about their central 
position. As a result, they permit skewing between the inner 
and outer ring and can thus compensate misalignments, 
shaft deflections and housing deformations.
If the outer ring rotates or the inner ring undergoes tumbling motion, 
the angular adjustment facility is smaller. 
In this case, please contact us.
Operating temperature
Barrel roller bearings with brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
Bearing with an outside diameter over 120 mm are dimensionally 
stable up to +200 °C.
Caution!
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide can 
be used up to +120 °C.
Cages
The standard cages for barrel roller bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code.
Barrel roller bearings with solid brass cages have the suffix MB. 
The cages are guided on the inner ring.
Solid window cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
indicated by the suffix TVP.
Caution!
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Cage/bore code
1) Other cage designs – for example brass cages instead of polyamide cages – 
are available by agreement. In such cages, suitability for high speeds and 
temperatures as well as the basic load ratings may differ from the values for 
bearings with standard cages.

Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,02 is 
necessary for roller bearings with cage.
Speeds
DIN 732-1 (draft 1994-12) does not give thermal reference speeds 
for barrel roller bearings.
Caution!
The dimension tables therefore only state limiting speeds nG. 
These values are for oil lubrication and must not be exceeded.
Location of
bearings with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered inner ring bore are:
■located either directly on tapered shaft seats or
■located on cylindrical shafts by means of an adapter sleeve.
The dimensions for support rings in the dimension tables must be 
observed.
Mounting dimensions
The shoulders on the adjacent construction (shaft/housing) must be 
sufficiently high that adequate abutment surfaces are ensured even 
with very large chamfer dimensions.
The maximum values for the radii ra and the diameters of 
the abutment surfaces da, Da are indicated in the dimension tables.
