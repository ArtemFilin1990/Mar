Performance
For over 50 years Max Schlatterer  
GmbH & Co. KG have been developing 
and manufacturing endless belts –  
drive belts, conveyor belts, belts made 
to customers’ requirements – in two  
factories in southern Germany. We 
actively contribute in the entire world  
to the development of innovative pro-
duction plants, supply convincing  
band and belt designs, we realize  
these ideas on equipment developed 
by our own specialized personnel and 
supply 100% quality by using electronic 
testing equipment. We are partners to 
significant companies in many different 
industries. And in the cigarette industry 
we are thus far ahead of our competitors.
Advantage
Schlatterer supply endless belts in all 
sizes up to a length of 4,800 mm and 
a width of 600 mm. Special sizes are 
available upon request. Due to our 
specific production techniques and 
production equipment, Esband pro-
ducts are unique. Intensive research 
and development  in close co-opera-
tion with the machine manufacturers 
constantly produce new, innovative 
bands and belts. They provide our 
customers with a competitive edge 
and offer a high degree of security 
for their production processes, based 
on superior characteristics over the 
entire belt length.
Philosophy
Where demands are high, the Endless 
Schlatterer Belt (Esband) convinces. 
They are manufactured according to 
our truly endless method without a 
single seam or splice. Thus, Esband is 
absolutely reliable and durable even 
at high speeds and in complicated 
environments.
Many of our Esband drive belts, con- 
veyor belts and special belts have   
been patented. A wide variety of  
basic materials and surface treat-
ments guarantee the perfect belt for 
every application. A comprehensive 
marketing and service network in over 
80 countries world-wide ensures a 
close co-operation with our customers.

Development
A good fifty years ago, the vision of 
frictionless production processes in-
spire the belt maker Max Schlatterer 
with an ingenious idea: He manufac-
tures a ring-shaped, woven, endless 
drive and conveyor belt without 
beginning or end and without any 
joints. Its advantages in terms of per-
formance, flexibility and durability 
prove to be enormous.
Schlatterer recognizes the far-	
reaching significance of his inven- 
tion, registers the patent, generates 
lively interest and achieves his first 
successes. 
High-performance materials con-
stantly lead to further refinements. 
Fame and commercial importance 
grow. Small at the outset, the enter-
prise develops rapidly. In the 1960s 
Schlatterer employs 140 people 
in the Swabian town of Herbrechtin-
gen. By the 1980s this figure has in-
creased to more than 300. And already 
at an early stage, he begins to invest 
in environmentally friendly methods 
of production.
Today over 600 highly motivated 
employees in two closely located pro-
duction sites covering a total area of 
20,000 m2 strive for further growth. 	
A superior product range, great enthu-
siasm for innovation and highest, 
electronically controlled product qua-
lity have made Schlatterer GmbH & 
Co. KG one of the most efficient and 
significant belt manufactures through- 
out the world.

Endless advantages
The Esband brand name is applied 
exclusively to flat belts and conveyor 
belts made utilizing a genuinely 
endless technique. Made with no 
joints or splices, they offer countless 
advantages:
endless homogenisation
Esband offers uniform elongation 
values, tear resistances and thickness 
tolerances over the complete length – 
weak points are eliminated.
endless flexibility
Esband functions even over the small-
est bending radii, frequent bending 
changes and over knife edges with 
absolute reliability.
endless quiet running
Esband totally avoids noise pulses 
that would otherwise be generated 
by joints and runs absolutely quietly.
endless care
Esband is bipolar: Low longitudinal 
elongation and transverse adaptabil-
ity endow it with small initial tension-
ing forces and low shaft loads.
endless precision adaptability
Esband provides for individually 	
matched carcass materials and coat-
ings for economically viable produc-
tion processes.
Schlatterer customers profit from 
intensive consultation, precise belt 
calculation and individual support.

Esband conveyor belts produced ac-
cording to the truly endless method 
enable frictionless processes. Each 
category of goods transported re-	
quires a specific type of band; each 
environment makes its specific de-
mands. The following list includes the 
most important fields of application:
Paper
For paper processing and paper hand- 
ling Esband offers bands with various 
degrees of elasticity, high ozone-resi-
stance, high breaking strength or low  
elongation, based on your require-
ments. Typical applications: Printing 
machines, copiers and scanners, cash 
dispensing and ticket issuing 
Bulk Material and Unit Goods
Esband transports every kind of unit 
goods and bulk material of all weight 
categories to perfection as our belts 
have exactly matched coefficients of 
friction, ideal elongation charactristics, 
self-tracking guides, perforations for 
vacuum transport, etc. Typical appli-
cations: Fixed shaft centre distances, 
knife edges, slider beds, vacuum 
transport.
Special Conveyor Belts
Esband supplies conveyor belts with 
special surface treatments for convey-
ing of unit goods and bulk materials 
under extreme conditions. Typical 
applications: Sharp ascent angles, 
highest temperatures, inclined feeder 
conveyors, synchronous and/or 
vacuum transport.
5
Transport
machines, paper and cardboard pro-
cessing machines.
Food Transport
Esband enables delicate processing 
and packaging of food. Our belts are 
FDA/BGA approved, easy to clean, tem- 
perature resistant with varying degrees 
of elasticity and  flexibility and various 
coefficients of friction. Typical appli-
cations: knife edges, transfer stations,  
automatic packaging machines, 
cheese-making machines, bakery lines.
Weighing Technology
Esband brings weighing technology 
to peak perfection as our belts are 
truly homogeneous over their entire 
length (including weight), with exactly 
adapted coating and elongation cha-
racteristics, special surface finishes 
and low-friction covers on the running 
side. Typical applications: For light-
weight bulk materials and unit goods, 
dynamic weighing devices, knife 
edges, small bending radii.

An Esband is always a belt made 
exactly to your requirements in 
endless form.
For further processing we employ a 
computer-controlled five-axis ma-
chine. This in-house development 
permits perforations and recesses in 
almost any shape (e.g., for suction 
slots or transporting bags).

* The standard hardness of PU coating is 
approx. 55° Shore A.
The following options are possible:
PU red hard     = approx. 70° ± 7° Shore A
PU grey hard   = approx. 70° ± 7° Shore A
PU yellow soft = approx. 30° ± 7° Shore A
Altering the surface also means altering 
the coefficient of friction, thickness and 
thickness tolerances.

Esband creates endless design possibilities. When you are 
a designer or machine manufacturer we can give you use-
ful information on pulley designs, design of the belt drive, 
arrangement of tensioning pulleys, placement of tension­
ing rollers and special drive forms.
1.	Guiding of the Flat Belt by Crowned Pulleys
Design of pulley depending on belt width b 
Textile flat belts run with a very high degree of directional 
stability. To ensure optimum belt guidance at least one 
of the pulleys should be crowned. The remaining pulleys 
may then be cylindrically shaped.
In case of limited production possibilities or large pulley 
widths, one of the other illustrated crown forms may be 
chosen.
Important note: To achieve optimum service life of the 
belt, pulleys which rotate in the same direction should be 
designed with a crown.
When pulleys are mounted in a parallel way and conven-
tional drive conditions exist, lower values than the given 
ones for crown height may be chosen.
Recommended materials: Steel, grey cast iron or alumi-
nium in ground or fine-ground form  
(Ra = 3.2 µm / Rz = 16µm or Ra = 1.6 µm / Rz + 6.3 µm).
We reserve the right to amend the specified values to 
reflect the latest state of the art.
Designs of the crown for 
guiding pulleys
h
bs
rs
Slightly crowned
Trapezoidal crown
Slightly crowned with 
shoulders (shoulders 
without guide tasks)
General advantages of 	
flat belts
Extremely high efficiency 
(>98.5%)
High belt speeds up to 
150 m/s (low mass-centri-
fugal forces up to 20 m/s 
can be disregarded)
Machine elements in 
wide variety (surfaces, 
materials, elongation)
Long service life
Many designs and specific 
solutions possible
High power density  
(30 kW/cm, depending 
upon belt speed)
Very good dynamic pro-
perties (quiet running, 
precise tracking)
Freedom in design -  
simplified design
Better shock attenuation 
and shock absorption
Use as overload pro-
tection for expensive 
machine components.

These calculations assume 
the following data:
- P = 7.5 kW	
- d1 = 140 mm
- n1 = 2900 rpm

Properties of conveyor belts for  
applications on the left hand side
-	 Low coefficient of friction on 	
	 running side
-	 Belt thickness as thin as possible 	
	 (especially knife edges and 	
	 weighing belts)
-	 If necessary, increase coefficient of 	
	 friction on the pulley (rubber coa-	
	 ting on pulley)
-	 Type of goods to be transported 	
	 (food)
-	 Resistance to chemicals
-	 Antistatic (carcass)
-	 Self-tracking guide with guide 	
	 wedges (not for knife edges!)

2. Design of the belt drive with crow-
ned/cylindrical pulleys
With gearing ratios exceeding 1:3 and 
horizontal shafts, the crown of the 
small pulley may be cylindrical. In the 
case of drives with vertical shafts we 
re­c­om­mend to crown both pulleys 
(see Fig. 1).
For multi-shaft belt drives the pulleys 
with the biggest diameter and rotating 
in the same sense must be crown­ed 
(see Fig. 2).
3.	Arrangement of tensioning rollers
When using tensioning rollers the fol-
lowing items must be observed:
-	 The diameter of the tensioning 	
	 roller should be selected as large as 	
	 possible
-	 The tensioning roller should always 	
	 be in the slack side of the drive
-	 The tensioning roller should always 	
	 be cylindrical
-	 The necessary pre-tension can be 	
	 applied by using tensioning rollers, 	
	 motor-driven rocker dolly switch, 	
	 eccentric, spring tension or the 	
	 inherent elasticity of the belt.

In-house, multi-purpose testing equipment enables 
Schlatterer to ensure precise quality inspection and assur-
ance. We test all Esband belts and bands according to our 
own strict testing standards for the following properties:
1.	Product length
Examination of the elongation characteristics at LO (manu- 
facturing length) and L1 (installed length), as well as at 
defined tractive forces both in the production line and in the 
laboratory on Universal testing machines.
2.	Product thickness
Inspection by means of high-quality micrometer instru-
ments for production and by inductive sensors with pneu-
matically applied force for quality assurance.
3.	Dynamic testing of running properties
Computer-controlled dynamic belt test rig with optical 
sensors for automatic measuring of width, lateral move-
ment and centric running accuracy.
4.	Static measuring of coefficient of friction
Determination of the coefficient of friction of  drive belt or 
conveyor belt to any material chosen.
