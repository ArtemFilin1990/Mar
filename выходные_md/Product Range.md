1. Introduction
IBC Wälzlager GmbH, Industrial Bearings and Components, is
proud to continue in the tradition of Robert Kling Wetzlar GmbH, a
company founded in 1918. IBC is widely known for producing high
precision rolling bearings that are used in machine tools, separa-
tors, centrifuges, compressors, gear boxes, printing machines,
textile machines and high speed units. IBC, founded in 1972, is
also a brand in the field of drive engineering, special-purpose
mechanical engineering and general mechanical engineering.
The company‘s distinguishing features are its efficient and high-
precision production of small and medium sized batches and its
innovative realisation of customer’s solutions.
By keeping our communication channels with the customer open
at all times we define objectives and consistently pursue our
common objectives; as a result, even very specific customer re-
quirements are swiftly and purposefully converted into commercial
solutions. Being the partner of our customers in terms of design
engineering we recognize that innovation in the field of bearings is
driven by being close to the customer’s application.
We have developed, and use, a rolling bearings data base and employ
modern calculation software. The use of such data and applications
allows us to offer an attractive and professional package of services
for bearing dimensioning. Vibration analysis is also part of our service
package. We were able to create, and continuously develop, these ser-
vices by constantly communicating with our customers. Our customers
can be sure of our ability to realise customer-specific special solutions.
Of course we also supply standard rolling bearings in various batch
sizes. Our business is characterised by the outstanding availability of
our products and services, and our customers are guaranteed solutions
that are a perfect fit, both for prototyping and for serial production.
We have also been traditionally involved in academic work: We
are in close working partnerships with colleges and universities,
both in the field of research and development and as our point of
reference for vocational training.
Apart from its use in research and development, our modern
production equipment also forms the foundation which enables
us, together with our skilled staff, to produce rolling bearings to
the highest quality specifications. It also ensures our quality in the
long term. And because we use such sophisticated machinery, we
pay special attention to the people who are part of the process.
Ever higher demands are being made on bearing systems, and
a variety of techniques and new materials have been developed
that are designed to meet the needs of today’s demanding and
extremely varied technical and commercial applications.
IBC rises to the challenge by constantly enhancing its performance,
continuously optimising its products and processes and by expand-
ing its product range.
The TI-I-5000 catalogue you have in your hand contains a summa-
ry of our products and services. You will find more specific technical
information, especially with regard to rotational speeds and load
ratings, in the more detailed IBC product catalogues.
IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings have been de-
signed for all rolling bearing applications that make great demands on
reliability, stiffness, speed capability and running accuracy; the bearings
may be used as single bearings or as bearing combinations. The many
different types available allow spindle manufacturers across different
sectors of industry as well as special-purpose mechanical engineering
firms to optimise their spindles by focusing on the criteria that are most
important to them. Technology and economic efficiency thus meet to
form a winning combination.
As the bearing of your choice will depend on the application you
are designing, IBC offers a variety of bearing series with many dif-
ferent versions, sizes and diverse design characteristics. This wide
range of products enables the bearing user to achieve a higher
performance at a lower cost. Angular contact ball bearings for
example can be supplied with contact angles of 15°, 25°, 30°, 40°
and 60° and with various rolling element diameters as well as with
rolling elements made of steel or ceramics. This makes them a
very popular choice. Our product and services range also includes

the possibility of choosing an ATCoat thin dense chromium coating
for special types of application.
High precision bearings that are grease-lubricated in our factory and
additionally sealed with contact or non-contact seals are mainte-
nance-free, meaning that for “life lubrication” becomes a reality. This
fact contributes both to simpler, customer-friendly designs and to
simpler assembly.
IBC also offers many different cage materials for high preci-
sion angular contact ball bearings that can be matched to each
specific application.
Single IBC angular contact ball bearings which carry a V-marking
may be used as single bearings, or they may be put together
to form bearing sets. The customer will thus find it much easier
to procure spare parts and keep parts in stock. We recommend
customers use bearing sets consisting of multiple precision an-
gular contact ball bearings if they have special requirements with
regard to stiffness and bearing load. Another area where IBC
excels is the manufacture of angular contact ball bearing sets
that match the customer‘s requirement and are ready delivered
for assembly. Not only does each bearing carry its individual
V-marking, but these sets also display a V-marking that spans
the whole set (High Precision Bearings TI-I-5050; 40° Angular
Contact Ball Bearings TI-I-4044).
IBC is proud to present its new DTB (Driven Tool Bearings)
high precision bearing series. As the name indicates, the contact
angle, inner geometry and running accuracy of this type of
high precision angular contact ball bearing have been specially
optimised for driven tools. This benefits the user, because the
deployment of such bearings leads to greatly enhanced machine
tool productivity.
The use of high precision rolling bearings in machine tools makes
great demands on the running accuracy of each component used.
In order to meet these requirements, IBC has developed high
precision cylindrical roller bearings that combine running accu-
racy characteristics with great stiffness and load carrying capacity
while at the same time providing for a high speed-capacity with a
smaller cross section. This smaller cross section is especially suited
to multi-spindle arrangements because it allows for smaller centre
distances. High precision cylindrical roller bearings make for ideal
floating bearings because they are able to compensate for heat-
related changes in length that occur in adjacent parts.
In addition to single row 60° ball screw support bearings (BS...),
IBC also manufactures double row 60° ball screw support
bearings that are designated as BSD... (for use in housings) and
BSDF... (flange version). These bearings enable the user to mount
the ball screw spindle with high precision, high load carrying capa-
city and low friction. The bearing is easy to install and requires little
maintenance, thereby providing a cost-effective solution. The end
result is that the user is able to benefit from an optimised overall
machine tool system (Ball Screw Support Bearings TI-I-5010).
IBC also manufactures an extensive range of high precision
bearing units. The great variety of possible applications along
with their diverse bearing requirements led us to develop a modu-
lar system that provides the design engineer with great flexibility
when designing different versions. These bearing requirements
include axial stiffness and load rating, low heat generation
through low friction as well as rotational speeds and running
accuracy. Bearing units that are ready for assembly have become
a very popular choice, because they simplify the assembly of
modules that belong together and also speed up the assembly
process. Moreover, because there is no axial contact surface in
the locating bores, the adjacent parts can be of a much simpler
design. IBC high precision bearing units are lubricated for life and
are sealed with labyrinth seals. They are designed for ball screws
that are most commonly used in machine tools as well as in
handling and measuring devices and in sheet-metal processing,

---

woodworking and special-purpose machines. Apart from offering
a standard range of high precision cartridge or pillow block units,
IBC also manufactures all kinds of special solutions according
to customer‘s specifications (Ball Screw Support Bearings
TI-I-5010).
Additional components used in rolling bearing systems, e.g. high
precision locknuts and labyrinth seals, have been an integral
part of IBC‘s range of products for many years.
IBC high precision locknuts with fine thread are used with precision
applications like rolling bearings for ball screws.
The securing systems integrated into the various locknuts permit
simple and accurate mounting and provide for lasting stability.
There is no need to provide for a retaining facility within the thread,
e.g. grooves, that hold locking washers. As a result, the full material
cross-section of the shaft is preserved, and a notch effect does not
occur either. By substituting imprecise locking washers by clamping
devices you will be able to achieve greater axial accuracy (reduced
axial runout). A further alternative to fitting separate seals is the use
of an integrated labyrinth seal. This range of technical possibilities
allows the user to realise a whole variety of options. And the result
here is increased efficiency (Precision Locknuts TI-I-5020).
Deep groove ball bearings have many applications and a simple
design, and because of their low friction they are suited to high
rotational speeds. Their use has many advantages: they are robust,
easy to maintain and economical. As deep groove ball bearings
can be produced with high precision and in a low noise version,
they are often used in electric motors. The extremely wide range
of dimensions and versions available makes it the most commonly
used type of rolling bearing.
IBC is also well known for the many different cage materials and
lubricants it offers. In a competitive environment, this wide range
of products enables customers to realise their applications exactly
as planned. Furthermore, as they are able to order from stock,
customers enjoy the advantage of easy availability -- procurement
lead time is shortened and own stock keeping reduced.
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings are the right
choice if the bearing has to be suited to high rotational speeds,
minimal frictional loss, high radial loads and heat-induced changes
in length in the adjacent parts. Cylindrical roller bearings that are
equipped with a cage can bear very high loads in the radial direc-
tion, and due to line contact between the roller and the raceway
they have the advantage of great stiffness. They are also designed
for high rotational speeds. IBC manufactures cylindrical roller bear-
ings of various designs and in a variety of dimensional series and
sizes. As this type of bearing is able to permit axial displacement,
it is the ideal choice for the floating bearings of working spindles in
machine tools. Cylindrical roller bearings are also used in pumps
and compressors. The range of bearings designed for general
mechanical engineering includes both single and double row
cylindrical roller bearings with cage and single as well as dou-
ble row full complement cylindrical roller bearings. Cylindrical
roller bearings with cage can achieve reasonably high rotational
speeds even under heavy loads. Full complement cylindrical
roller bearings, on the other hand, are designed for low rotational
speeds and pivoting. This type of bearing can bear very heavy
radial loads, because it contains the greatest possible number of
rolling elements. Great stiffness is also one of its characteristics.
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are very often chosen
in space-saving designs, and are used in slow-rotating bearing
applications that are heavily loaded (Cylindrical Roller Bearings
TI-I-4010).
Spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and special
bearings complete the full IBC product range. The choice of the
right lubricant has a very great impact on the operational safety
of precision bearings, because lubricants reduce friction and wear.

The majority of rolling bearings that do not reach their scheduled
life time fail because of faulty lubrication.
In order to enable the best possible lubrication to be achieved,
IBC keeps a wide range of high-quality lubricants in stock and
supplies these to its customers. High precision rolling bearings that
are ready-greased during manufacture can be ordered from IBC
by specifying the relevant suffix. For such high precision rolling
bearings, the only thing the customer needs to do is to carry out the
grease distribution run.
In addition to its well known and time-tested range of rotational
rolling bearings IBC also produces linear motion bearings that
are guided in rails that have an X- or U-profile and an internal
raceway. This technology allows for very compact and space-
saving systems. The most common choices are telescope linear
motion bearings and linear motion bearing carriage systems.
Typical uses include the housings of machine tools as well as
pullouts, e.g. those used in the railway supply industry, in medical
technology or in warehouse logistics.
IBC’s product range includes ATCoat thin dense chromium
coated high precision rolling bearings that are designed for
special applications. The advantage of this type of bearing drives
from characteristics that increase the service life of rolling bearings
and from its very good resistance to wear and corrosion
(ATC-Coated Bearings, ATC Technology Coatings).
Our comprehensive product range and the ability to support our
customers on-site all over the world via our service and technical
departments enable us, to develop specific and efficient bearing
solutions for our customers, and in partnership with our customers.
Companies increasingly rely on global sourcing and the localisation
of market-specific products for their business. That is why being
able to service a company‘s operations all over the world is
becoming increasingly important. IBC Wälzlager has production
facilities and sales locations in Oberbiel (Germany), Aßlar (Ger-
many), Grenchen (Switzerland), Taichung (Taiwan), Mumbai (India)
as well as a sales base in Guangzhou (China). This arrangement is
the basis for servicing European markets as well as giving access
to the future Global markets.
IBC is committed to precision technology -- and to you as its custo-
mer. We will be glad to support you at an early stage of application
engineering and will be happy to discuss any plans you may have.

IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings meet the
highest demands for reliability, stiffness, speed capability,
running accuracy and vibration characteristics in any given
installation space. This achievement calls for a whole variety of
bearing series, each providing different versions and dimen-
sions that have different design characteristics in order to
achieve both improved performance and reduced costs for
rolling bearings. The great number of bearing types available
permit the customer to make the best possible choice, allowing
for both superior technology and economical solutions.
The light 18, 19 and 10 dimensional series are suited to high
rotational speeds. Rolling bearings whose designation includes
the suffix X have been further improved to accomplish very high
speeds. The H design was designed almost exclusively with
a view to achieving the highest speeds. The heavy 02 and 03
dimensional series, by contrast, are focused on achieving high
load ratings and great stiffness.
IBC has tailored the internal design of its high precision angular
contact ball bearings to the diverse requirements of the machine
tool industry. IBC therefore offers as standard high precision
angular contact ball bearings with a contact angle of 15°, 25°
or 30°. The high-speed H design has a contact angle of 18°.
The different contact angles meet individual requirements for
combined loads with regard to stiffness and rotational speed
characteristics. IBC also manufactures precision angular contact
ball bearings with contact angles of 35°, 40° and 60°. You will
find further information on these bearings in the publications
40° Angular Contact Ball Bearings TI-I-4044, Ball Screw
Support Bearings TI-I-5010 and High Precision Bearings
TI-I-5050.
Hybrid bearings equipped with a combination of ceramic rolling
elements and steel rings are used not only in high-speed
applications; their many advantages also include their reliability
and their extended grease service life. The harder and lighter
ceramic rolling elements reduce the rolling bearing’s friction
and the wear of the lubricant by improving rolling conditions
even in an unfavourable lubrication environment.
As a result of the increased demand for grease-lubricated high
precision angular contact ball bearings, IBC has added to its
versions that include types fitted with seals and greased ready
for use. The standard lubrication fill, implemented during the
manufacturing process, ensures the optimal grease type and
quantity are applied, which has a positive effect on bearing life
and machine performance. IBC high precision ball bearings
that are filled with grease during the manufacturing process are
ready for immediate installation and operation, subject to nor-
mal grease running-in procedure. As they are optionally sealed
on one or both sides with non-contact seals (2RSZ) that do not
limit the suitability of the bearings for high rotational speeds,
sealed high precision angular contact ball bearings are ideally
protected against contamination and air currents. And in the
case of vertical or pivoting spindles the seals additionally act as
grease retention washers.
If grease-lubricated bearings are required to run at or above
their limits, open bearings may be lubricated laterally with oil
or an oil/air mist via spacer rings. IBC high precision angular
contact ball bearings with outer ring lubrication are an option
in this case. No changes need to be made to the disign of the
rolling bearings themselves. They have the suffix S and have a
circumferential groove and radial lubrication holes for an oil jet
lubrication in the outer ring. Integrated O-rings in the outer ring
function as a seal in the housing.
Not only single row high precision angular contact ball bearings
are used in machine tools, IBC high precision cylindrical roller
bearings are used as well. This kind of bearing is characterised
by its great stiffness and load carrying capacity, while at the same
time providing for high running accuracy, high speed-capacity
and a small cross section. They are manufactured as single row
bearings in the 19 and 10 dimensional series, and as double row
bearings in dimensional series 30 and 49.
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings with the HN designa-
tion have an enhanced inner geometry enabling them to achieve
the highest speeds. Further options provided by IBC include
ceramic rollers (CR) and bearings that only have half the number
of rollers (Q852).
There are two different designs: either the rolling elements are
axially guided by the outer ring (NNU) or the inner ring (N and
NN). The set of rolling elements and the cage both remain bet-
ween the shoulders when the ring without shoulder is removed
from the rolling bearing. This fact allows the inner and outer
rings to be mounted separately and in a much simpler manner.
All double row IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings are
fitted with a lubrication groove with three holes on the outer ring
(designation W33, 120° arrangement) in order to guarantee
effective lubrication.
IBC manufactures special designs of high precision cylindrical
roller bearings for specialised applications. Please contact our
applications engineers in this case. They will be glad to help
you find a solution to your special application requirements and
bearing designs.
IBC High precision tapered roller bearings for spindles and
tables complete the product range of IBC.

IBC High Precision Angular Contact Ball Bearings for
stub spindles
Manufacturing overview
Driven Tool Bearings (DTB)
The DTB (Driven Tool Bearings) high precision bearing series
has been specially designed for driven tools that carry out
milling and drilling work in state-of-the-art high precision
machine tools. This sort of work is typically performed in a
confined installation space under conditions that include short
cycle times and great machining forces. It is therefore essential
in today’s precision machining environment that the bearing
provides great stiffness, very high running accuracy and the
ability to operate with high rotational speed. Only then can the
operator achieve high-precision machining results, increased
cutting performance as well as increased system availability
with the minimum of maintenance.
IBC’s customers may now choose from the DTB (Driven Tool
Bearings) precision bearing series. As the name indicates, the
contact angle, inner geometry and running accuracy of this type
of precision angular contact ball bearing have been specially
optimised for driven tools. The use of such bearings has a
number of advantages for the operator, chiefly among them
more accurate machining results and enhanced machine tool
productivity.
DTB rolling bearings are manufactured in the 19... and 10...
production series and with contact angles of 25° (E) or 30° (A).
They have an altogether improved axial load capacity and
stiffness and can potentially absorb high combined radial and
axial loads. In cases where it is the end user who decides on
the final deployment of a tool, this type of IBC bearing offers
the ideal combination of characteristics suited to driven tools.
All DTB precision angular contact ball bearing production series
conform to tolerance class P4, and preloads are matched to the
typical loading of the different kinds of application.

IBC 40° Angular Contact Ball Bearings
Manufacturing overview
A whole range of precise solutions will be needed to meet the
requirements of the diverse technical applications and operating
conditions in the mechanical engineering industry. Requirements
for instance include high rotational speeds and load carrying
capacity, precise running accuracy, stiffness, or combined radial
and axial load in combination with low heat generation. These
needs can only be met with the aid of an extensive range of
angular contact ball bearings.
Single row 40° angular contact ball bearings only absorb axial
forces in the direction in which the rolling elements are loaded as
a result of pressure brought to bear between the high shoulders
of the inner and outer ring. Because of the contact angle, any
radial forces that take effect produce an axial force; the design
must therefore make allowances for this axial force elsewhere.
Single row angular contact ball bearings produced in a univer-
sal version are designated with the suffixes UA, UB, UL and
UO. They are suited for mounting in sets in X-arrangement,
O-arrangement or tandem mounting, and can be used in any
arrangement desired.
There are many areas of application that require the shaft to be
guided without clearance, e.g. gear boxes, gear motors, blowers,
ventilators, pumps as well as textile and printing machines that
all may have combined radial and axial loads.

Extended Capacity and Advanced Application characteristics
are a distinguishing mark of the EXAD cylindrical roller bearings
production series. Due to their improved design, better materials
and enhanced production processes, these bearings have been
greatly improved with regard to service life, reliability, greater
load carrying capacity, smoother running characteristics as well
as reduced friction and, as a consequence, less heat generation.
The innovative EXAD technology has become the standard for
the types mentioned above.
IBC‘s product range of rolling bearings contains a whole variety of
innovative solutions that guarantee secure functioning of floating,
supporting or locating bearings. These solutions include cylind-
rical roller bearings. IBC manufactures cylindrical roller bearings
with various designs, and in a variety of dimensional series and
sizes, but the majority of these bearings come in the form of
single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage, as described in
this catalogue. Because the N and NU designs allow for axial
displacement they are the ideal solution for the type of floating
bearing that is for instance used in pumps and compressors.
The NUP, NJ and HJ designs are used as locating bearings.
The range of bearings designed for general mechanical engine-
ering includes both single and double row cylindrical roller bear-
ings with cage as well as single and double row full complement
cylindrical roller bearings.

IBC Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Manufacturing overview NCF, NJG
.
Single row full complement cylindrical roller bearings are manu-
factured as NCF and NJG designs.
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and
are not greased during manufacture. They can be supplied with
oil or grease lubrication via the front side during assembly or
even while they are in operation.
NCF design cylindrical roller bearings have an inner ring with
two fixed shoulders and an outer ring with one fixed shoulder
that is able to axially guide the shaft in one direction. The
cylindrical roller bearing is held together by a snap ring located
on the side of the outer ring that does not have a shoulder.
Bearings of this design are able to absorb axial loads in one di-
rection; the production series of these bearings are designated
by the numbers 29, 30 and 22.
NJG design single row full complement cylindrical roller bear-
ings have a self retaining set of rollers. This means that the
outer ring, which has two fixed shoulders and contains the set
of rollers, can be retracted from the inner ring that has one fixed
shoulder. A special securing mechanism to prevent the rolling
elements from falling out is not required; this makes mounting
and dismounting much easier. These bearings, too, are able to
absorb axial loads in one direction.
NJG design bearings are designed for slow moving, very heav-
ily loaded or pivoting applications and are manufactured in the
heavy 23 production series.

IBC Single Row Precision 60° Ball Screw Support
Bearings
Manufacturing overview
Unilaterally effective precision ball screw support bearings only
absorb axial forces in the direction in which the rolling elements
are loaded as a result of pressure brought to bear between the
high shoulders of the inner and outer ring. In most cases, these
bearings are set against each other in pairs. A common type of
application is the bearing of a ball screw.
Ball screw support bearings are universally face ground. They can
be mounted in a flexible manner at each bearing location, either as
a single bearing or as a bearing set put together during manufac-
ture; sets may be arranged according to the customer’s needs.
Sets put together during manufacture display an overall V-mark
across the outer rings of the bearings. This V-mark spans the entire
set of ball screw support bearings.
The customer benefits from these bearings because they are easy
to install, have a long service life without needing maintenance
and allow for the possibility of being provided with for life grease
lubrication or circulating oil lubrication. Additional benefits include
high positioning accuracy and low energy consumption during
operation; the bearings also operate safely during fast acceleration
and high rotational speeds of the ball screw. The use of ceramic
rolling elements or of bearing rings coated with ATC thin dense
chromium coating are further options if you want to achieve even
higher rotational speeds. In addition to 60° ball screw support
bearings that are open, we also offer versions that have seals on
both sides. The sealed versions help to achieve good operational
safety even in difficult environments.

IBC Double Row Precision 60° Ball Screw Support
Bearings
Manufacturing overview
Ball screws used in machine tools help to feed work pieces and
machine parts quickly, efficiently and accurately. The BSD and
BSDF bearing series have been designed for straightforward
and easy mounting to ball screws.
A double row 60° ball screw support bearing enables the user to
mount the ball screw spindle with high precision (P4), high load
carrying capacity, low friction and great stiffness. The bearing is
easy to install and requires little maintenance, thereby providing
cost-effective use. The result is that the user is able to benefit
from an optimised overall machine tool system.
The double row ball screw support bearing is available in a
standard version and a heavy series. The heavy series has
the same shaft diameter but a larger reference circle than the
standard series; and because the rolling elements are bigger in
the heavy series, it enables greater load ratings to be achieved.
As they come with a contact angle of 60°, both series accom-
modate loads made up mainly of axial forces. The bearing
rings are matched so as to achieve a defined preload for the
mounted bearing with the aid of a precision locknut. The double
row 60° ball screw support bearing in BSDF design is suitable
for mounting the bearing by screws directly on to the adjacent
construction or into a radial locating bore, without the need of
further housing parts. In addition, a circumferential extraction
groove makes disassembly from a locating bore easier. The
bearing also features re-lubrication channels that are sealed with
detachable threaded pins.
As standard, both bearing series come sealed on both sides and
ready-lubricated with high-performance grease whose lubricity in
most cases will last for the entire service life of the bearing.

IBC High Precision Bearing Units
Manufacturing overview
For a fast and easy installation procedure IBC recommends the
use of precision bearing units that are ready for assembly. The
main field of application for such bearing units is ball screws
in machine tools; the units are lubricated for life and sealed
with labyrinth seals. The many possible arrangements within a
rolling bearing set (which are designed to meet the many differ-
ent requirements the bearings have with regard to great axial
stiffness and load rating, low friction, high running accuracy as
well as high rotational speeds and fast acceleration) led us to
develop a modular system that provides the design engineer
with great flexibility when designing different versions.
Some precision bearing housings that have an identical installa-
tion space can be supplied with 60° ball screw support bearings
that have different bores. This has proved beneficial in the
case of machine tools that do not have the same shaft length.
Where the shaft length is different, it is essential to choose
a greater ball screw diameter for longer strokes if the critical
bending speed of the spindle may be exceeded. In this case,
bearings that have different bores, but otherwise share the
same mounting dimensions, allow the user to design a uniform
bearing ambience and thereby to achieve cost-efficiency.

IBC High Precision Bearing Units
Manufacturing overview
Bearing units that are ready for assembly have become a very
popular choice. The assembly of modules that belong together
simplifies and speeds up the assembly process, resulting
in greater efficiency. And because there is no axial contact
surface in the locating bores, the adjacent parts can be of a
much simpler design.
Bearings units come in two different types: precision car-
tridge units and precision pillow block units. As the IBC high
precision cartridge units are flat on both sides they are low
in overall height. This enhances their design, making them
easier to handle during assembly.
The cartridge units may be fixed to the face-milled mounting
space by way of two design solutions: they can either be pre-
cisely inserted into a calibrated bore and bolted down, or they
can be bolted down in an overcalibrated bore in a friction-
locked manner; this means that they can be radially adjusted
during mounting.
Should the machine need servicing, the technicians on site
will appreciate the simple way in which a module (bearing unit
plus ball screw) may be replaced with a new module. Preas-
sembled modules can also be quickly mounted, leading to
shorter waiting periods and therefore shorter shutdown times.
The pre-integrated locknut with matching labyrinth seal is
a feature of the BSBU-M series that provides for easy and
secure preloading of the precision cartridge unit.
Whereas in the past, cartridge units had additionally to be
accommodated by supports, IBC high precision pillow block
units have the effect of reducing installation space and assem-
bly time. Experience has confirmed the many advantages of
having strict tolerance requirements for the contact surfaces
of the locating and floating bearing units in the BSPB,
BSPB-M and BLPB series that have the same reference
dimensions. This means that the location face for the preci-
sion bearing units can be processed together with those
of the guidance. The use of predrilled pinholes allows for
precise fixing. Should you need bearings for ball screw nuts
(according to DIN 69051), IBC will supply you with its high
precision bearing units that come with an adapter. Such units
are especially used for long ball screws. The standard IBC
versions are suited to practically all types of application and
are used as the basis for customer-specific special solutions.
IBC high precision locknuts with fine thread are used with
high-precision applications because of their high accuracy.
The securing systems integrated into the various locknuts
permit simple and accurate mounting and provide for lasting
stability. The securing systems do not change the circular
cross-section of the shaft, and no additional changes occur,
so the securing systems do not cause grooves to form on the
shaft. Because of the superfinishing of the thread and the
contact surface, IBC high precision locknuts attain an axial
face runout that conforms to ISO standard tolerance class IT3.
The different designs of IBC high precision locknuts are suited
to a wide range of applications. The high precision locknuts
are manufactured in various widths suitable for different axial
loads. The securing devices may be axially or radially accessi-
ble, depending on the design.

10. IBC High Precision Locknuts
We recommend using our precision locknuts from the MMR
series for applications with limited installation space, or if you
want to save on weight. In the MBA and MBC series, the locking
of a locknut which cannot be reached radially is secured axially
with accessible clamping screws. This production series requires
a greater width due to its specific design. The securing device
in the MBA design can slightly increase the axial preload of the
locknut, whereas in the MBC design it can slightly reduce the
axial preload of the locknut. The MMRB version has a radial
securing device, and its cross-section is the same as the MBA
and MBC precision locknuts; it therefore permits higher loads
and higher tightening torques. Under the designation MMRBS
and MBAS, the MMRB and MBA production series are also
manufactured with an integrated labyrinth seal.

12. IBC Linear Motion Bearings and Telescopic Guides
12. Telescopic Bearings
IBC linear motion bearings are a major addition to IBC’s wide
range of rotational rolling bearings. Two very different designs
exist that are structurally suited to completely different require-
ments. These designs are called “telescopic bearing system” and
“carriage systems”.
IBC linear motion bearings are long-lasting and economical and
show their strength in routine, everyday situations where machine
parts or manually handled parts need to be smoothly moved
either by hand or automatically, and heavy weights need to be
guided precisely and energy-efficiently.
Stiffness, a smooth run and durability are important character-
istics of IBC linear motion bearings. The bearings are also
compact in their design and easy to assemble.
LCE production series
In this design, the short slide and the cage never leave the inside
of the telescopic bearing‘s guiding rail. The greatest possible
pullout is slightly more than half the length of the guiding rail.
LCAE production series
Here, the slide and the guideway are of the same length. The
pullout is therefore longer, slightly more than the length of the
guideway, and can be extended to both sides.
LCAD production series
In this design, two guideways are combined with two slides of
the same length whose two inner rails have been bolted to one
another. This allows for a stroke in both directions of slightly more
than the length of the guideway.
LCAH production series
The LCAH design is characterised by two guideways whose two
outer rails have been bolted to one another, and by two slides
that are of the same length as the guideways. The pullout is
slightly longer than the overall length for this design too.
LCAS / LCBS production series
In these series, the guideways have been placed one upon the
other to form an S- or Z-shaped support profile. This enables a
major reduction in the overall width, great load carrying capacity
and great bending stiffness to be achieved. The different
versions in these series are equipped with pullouts that can be
extended either to one or both sides.

Compared to telescopic linear motion bearings, carriage systems
are able to realise much longer runways; these are measured as
the length of the guideway minus the length of the carriage.
Sealing lips and wipers on the slide make sure that carriage
systems enjoy a secure and long-lasting operation, even in a
heavily contaminated environment.
As the guideway is available both as a locating and a floating
bearing system, even designs that have multiple supports are
able to include a structurally defined support and continue
to function steadily in the case of unavoidable tolerances, or
changes in temperature or the direction of force.
The great number of options available for the IBC carriage
systems makes it easier for the user to design the adjacent
parts, enabling efficient solutions to be designed.

Cross-section of ATCoat coating
Rolling bearings coated with ATCoat
The material surface of a rolling bearing is becoming more and
more important to the overall performance of machines, power
units and equipment. However, outside influences very often alter
the surface quality of materials or corrode the surface material.
A whole range of advantages is achieved by coating the material
surface of a rolling bearing.
An ATC thin dense chromium coating protects the surface from
outside environmental conditions and thereby increases the
service life of rolling bearings and the life time of machines and
equipment. The advantages of this coating also include energy
saving and an efficient use of material. The ATCoat process
permits the combination of a tough basic material with a firmly
adhering, very thin and accurate chromium coat that is free of
cracks. This is why, compared to bearings of the same size, those
with an ATCoat coating offer very good resistance to wear and
corrosion.
Rolling bearings coated with ATCoat are an alternative to rolling
bearings made of corrosion resistant steel. A better protection
against corrosion is achieved, especially with regard to the func-
tional surfaces. The coating layer of 2-4 µm has a cone-shaped
surface texture and gives an especially good performance in ex-
treme conditions. Especially if used in combination with ceramic
rolling elements, ATCoat coating permits a significant increase
in speed at lower operating temperatures. Fretting corrosion that
may form on floating bearings, a phenomenon that occurs due
to the micro displacement of the outer rings of the bearing during
thermal expansion or vibration, is also avoided. In many cases
this leads to a significantly longer and trouble-free operating of
units. Because of the special surface topography, the emergency
run properties of the bearings are substantially improved. Should
the lubrication system fail for instance, the units are still able to
run under part load for a certain period of time; they can also be
shut down properly. This means that secondary damage can be
limited or avoided altogether. IBC high precision rolling bearings
with ATCoat coating are therefore often used in unfavourable
lubrication conditions.
Such unfavourable conditions exist for example:
■if lubrication is impossible in a certain environment;
■if lubrication may only be effected with low-viscosity media
that do not produce a separative lubrication film;
■if very low rotational speeds occur that do not allow an
elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication film to develop;
■if oscillating movements without achieving a full revolution
occur, and a separative lubrication film cannot be maintained
at the reversal points;
■if sliding occurs in unloaded rolling bearings;
■if, during fast accelerations or decelerations, smearing occurs
when bearing rolling elements slide due to the force of
continuance that is caused by mass inertia in conjunction with
an inadequate preload.
