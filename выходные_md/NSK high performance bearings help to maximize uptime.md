If SWR Bearings are used on 1–8 segments out of 15 segments of a 2-strand continuous casting machine, then
segment life is extended on average 1.6 times. The estimated reduction effect is 20%–30% of total maintenance cost.
Maintenance cost includes expenses for repairing of rolls, replacement of bearings, seal and ﬁttings, as well as
labor cost required on every segment replacement.

with aligning rings (for free end) reduced unexpected accidents and lowered maintenance costs to a
minimum by using rolls to the full extent of their operating life. The used bearings, after the fatigue
analysis by using X-ray, proved to have a residual life corresponding to 2–4 times the tested period.

Overall cost beneﬁt in a ﬁve-stand cold rolling mill (four-high rolling) using Water-TF Bearings is roughly 30% to 35% compared
to open-type bearings and maintenance cost beneﬁt is roughly 25% to 30% if compared to conventional sealed bearings.
Cost beneﬁt is the sum of costs related to grease, bearing usage, seal repair, and maintenance costs ((1)+(2)+(3)).

• Target equipment: tandem cold rolling mills (4-high) 
• Segment example: work rolls
• Bearing type: sealed four-row tapered roller bearings (Fig. 1) 
• Bearing No.: WTF343KVS4551
High-load capacity design
New internal structure specifications,
combined with a new type of seal, increase 
bearing capacity (patent pending).
New seal and holder
The new seal and its holder make handling 
easier and minimize seal damage (patent 
pending).
New bore seal
The new bore seal prevents negative pressure 
that causes water entry and provides for easier 
mounting and dismounting (patents pending).
