Tyson® Tapered Roller Bearings Company History
The Tyson® Bearing Company was founded in 1929 by Frank Tyson for the purpose of manufacturing a unique design
cageless tapered roller bearing.  A factory was built in Massillon, Ohio and production began in 1930.  In 1939, the 
company was placed on the Navy approved materials list and became a member of the AFBMA (now the ABMA).
During the war years, the company produced a variety of war munitions, as well as bearings.  Immediately following the
war, production was expanded to include traditional cage type tapered roller bearings.
In 1955, the company was acquired by SKF Industries Inc., but continued to operate under the Tyson® name and 
trademark.  In 1965, SKF built a second factory in Glasgow, Kentucky for the purpose of manufacturing Tyson® tapered
roller bearings for automotive wheel bearing applications.  In 1976, the size of the plant was doubled.
In 1981, it was decided to market the products as SKF bearings, and the Tyson® trademark was retired from active use.
In the 1980's, the market demand for the type of bearings produced by Tyson® changed and the result was a
consolidation of the production of the Massillon plant into the newer plant in Glasgow.  The original plant in Massillon
was closed at the end of 1985.
RBC purchased the tapered roller bearing operations of SKF USA Inc. in June, 1999.  The name of the company again
became Tyson® Bearing Company, Inc., and the Tyson® brand name and trademark were reactivated after a hiatus of
almost 20 years.
Quality - A Tradition of Tyson® Bearing Company
Many of the Tyson's® employees have over 30 years of experience in the manufacture of tapered roller bearings.  The
Hartsville, SC factory is ISO 9001:2000 certified for the design, manufacture, and assembly of tapered roller bearings,
and the quality systems and equipment are state-of-the-art.
Tyson® Tapered Roller Bearing Cones and Cups - Available Separately or as Sets
Tapered roller bearing cups and cones are not just ordinary bearings.  A bearing is a complete unit.  Cups and cones
retain their separate identity and can be purchased separately.  They can also be interchanged at will within a given
series.  In the United States, the majority of tapered roller bearings are purchased as separate cups and cones.  Within 
a given series we can also furnish bearings packaged as a cup and cone set, a complete bearing unit. Due to the 
variability in other manufacturers’ processes, we recommend pairing a Tyson® cone and cup for optimum performance in
most applications. 
The Tyson® Tapered Roller Bearing - Another Name for Long and Reliable Service
All ABMA-designated inch tapered roller bearings with a given part number are, theoretically, interchangeable.  However,
the design of Tyson® bearings and the manufacturing processes provide the benefits and reliability demanded by your
application at the most competitive prices offered in the industry for comparable products. The internal geometry
provides additional benefits that are lacking in many other products currently being marketed as "equivalent."

Installation and Maintenance
Tapered roller bearings should always be installed and maintained according to the original equipment manufacturer's
recommendations. Failure to lubricate, install, adjust, and maintain these bearings properly can result in shortened 
bearing life, equipment failure, and personal injury.
Tyson® tapered roller bearings come from the factory with a light coat of preservative designed to keep the bearings
from rusting. It does not provide adequate operating lubrication. The bearings must either be thoroughly greased or
immersed in the oil used in oil bath lubrication before assembly. The bearings and lubricant must be kept very clean
through the installation process. It is not necessary to remove the preservative coating before installation as long as the
bearing is clean. 
Adjustment of the bearings is critical to achieving the best possible bearing life. As shown in the graph, a slight amount
of preload provides maximum life, but it falls off dramatically if too much preload is applied. Many applications
recommend a small amount of end play in the final adjustment because preload is hard to measure without equipment
specifically designed for that purpose, and that equipment is not normally available in the field. Again, it is most
important that the OEM's instructions are followed with regard to bearing adjustment and maintenance.

RBC Tapered Thrust Bearings
In 2001, RBC purchased the assets of an Oklahoma-based company that manufactures tapered thrust bearings. The
primary application for these bearings is in the heavy truck and trailer industry. Applications include steer axles for
trucks, tractors, and construction equipment, and landing gear for class 8 trailers.  Due to the tapered roller design,
these bearings offer significant thrust load capacity and can be used in a variety of other applications where that is a
requirement.  Both the races and rollers of the thrust bearings are case hardened which offers advantages in
applications where shock loads and/or misalignment are present. 
RBC utilizes a full complement of rollers where possible, which provides higher load capacity than designs using roller
retainers. Also, there is better roller alignment with the full complement design.  This improves the life of the bearing.
As an option, RBC offers many sizes of thrust bearings with an integral seal. These bearings are designated with a -S
suffix. This provides ease of installation and simplifies the design of the end product. Bearings can also be supplied
greased as an option. Greased bearings are designated with a -GX suffix.  Bearings designated with a -C suffix denote a
cylindrical roller design which requires an application review by an RBC application engineer before installing in your
application.
RBC stocks most of the sizes shown in the following section of this catalog. In addition, RBC will consider adding new
sizes to the existing product assortment on a case-by-case basis.  RBC products are available in both bulk and single
boxes to meet customers’ packaging requirements.

RBC Tapered Thrust Bearings
RBC tapered thrust bearings are manufactured in the RBC’s Oklahoma City, Oklahoma plant.  The rollers and races are
constructed from high grade bearing steel and are case hardened. Sealed, unsealed, and greased versions are
available.  RBC manufactures the most popular sizes for truck steer axle, trailer landing gear, and other industrial 
applications.  Most of the sizes shown are stocked. 
RBC tapered thrust bearings have been developed in 6 configurations.  Please refer to the table on the opposite page to
determine which style corresponds to your part number.
