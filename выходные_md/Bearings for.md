● Seal lip structure prevents entry of foreign matter while allowing 
entry of oil.
● Lower torque than conventional contact seal bearings.
● Sealed-in grease with a high affinity for gear oil to aid initial lubrication.
● Special heat treatment and improved raceway surfaces extend 
service life by more than twofold.

Bearings are expected to reduce maintenance costs and enhance performance for a variety of 
equipment. NSKHPS spherical roller bearings satisfy these requirements by fully utilizing NSK’s 
experience and expertise to deliver longer life and higher limiting speed.
The TM series delivers longer operating life under environments contaminated with foreign 
particles by incorporating a special seal that prevents the entry of foreign particles and has been 
especially effective in agricultural machinery and automobile transmission systems.
These bearings have improved durability and reliability and achieve long service life under harsh operating conditions, such 
as continuous operation for long periods of time, by utilizing a pinion shaft with a cage and rollers as a single assembly.
These bearings developed using new materials and new heat treatment methods specifically designed 
to improve durability provide long service life under the harsh lubrication conditions with the superior 
resistance to wear and seizure. Hi-TF bearings are capable of handling the foreseeable needs of the 
future as well as meeting today’s requirements.
The HR series of high-load bearings provides excellent performance in diverse applications.
These bearings have two O-rings mounted in the outer ring to enhance creep prevention.

● O-rings enhance creep prevention.
● Assembly is easy since bearings can be fitted 
with a loose tolerance.
● Very little abrasion occurs on the bore surface 
of the housing, making reuse possible.
● Bearings can be replaced since boundary 
dimensions are identical to standard bearings. 
No reworking of the housing is required.

Note 1. Although recommended fi ts are G6 or H7, G6 is recommended when used under conditions that prioritize insertion under light pre-load.

2.  Please contact NSK for seal and shield selection.
Note on mounting Creep-Free Bearings
●When oil or grease is applied to the outer diameter of the bearing, use a mineral oil or a synthetic hydrocarbon oil 
(NSK’s EA2, etc.).
●O-ring material is nitrile rubber (operating temperature range: –30 to 120 °C) as a standard specifi cation. Please 
contact NSK for use under special environments such as high temperatures.

Note:  Maximum continuous operating temperature for standard nitrile rubber seals is 110 °C.

Measures depending on the operating conditions Measures depending on the bearing
●Part: Outer ring of a deep groove ball bearing

Creep
●Part: Inner ring of an angular contact ball bearing
●Symptom: Flaking occurs around half of the circumference of 
the raceway surface
●Cause: Incorrect lubrication
●Part: Inner ring of an angular contact ball bearing
●Symptom: Flaking occurs diagonally along raceway
●Cause: Improper alignment between shaft and housing 
during mounting
●Part: Inner ring of an angular contact ball bearing
●Symptom: Flaking of raceway at ball pitch
●Cause: Dents due to shock load while stationary
●Part: Inner ring of a deep groove ball bearing
●Symptom: Flaking of raceway at ball pitch
●Cause: Dents due to shock load during mounting
Flaking
Damage Condition
Flaking occurs when 
fragments of bearing 
material chip off from 
the smooth surface of 
the raceway or rolling 
elements due to 
rolling fatigue, thereby 
creating regions 
having rough and 
coarse texture.
Creep is a phenomenon in 
bearings where relative 
slipping occurs at the fi tting 
surfaces and thereby creates a 
clearance at the fi tting surface.
Creep causes a shiny 
appearance, occasionally with 
scoring or wear.
Possible Cause
・Excessive load
・Incorrect mounting 
(misalignment)
・Moment load
・Entry of foreign matter, water 
penetration
・Poor lubrication, Improper 
lubricant
・Unsuitable bearing clearance
・Improper precision for shaft or 
housing, unevenness in housing 
rigidity, large shaft bending
・Progression from rust, corrosion 
pits, smearing, dents (brinelling)
・Insuffi cient interference or 
loose fi t
・Insuffi cient sleeve tightening
Measures depending on the operating conditions Measures depending on the bearing
●Reconfi rm the bearing 
application and check the 
load conditions
●Improve the mounting method
●Improve the sealing 
mechanism, prevent rust 
during idle periods
●Use a lubricant with a proper 
viscosity, improve the 
lubrication method
●Check the precision of shaft 
and housing
●Check the bearing internal 
clearance
●Check the interference, and 
prevent rotation
●Correct the sleeve tightening
●Investigate the shaft and 
housing precision
●Preload in the axial direction
●Prevent axial movement of 
ring
●Apply adhesive to the fi tting 
surface
●Apply a fi lm of lubricant to the 
fi tting surafce

●Part: Inner ring of an angular contact ball bearing
●Symptom: Notable fretting occurs over entire circumference 
of bore surface
●Cause: Insuffi cient interference fi t
●Part: Inner ring of a deep groove ball bearing
●Symptom: Fretting occurs on the bore surface
●Cause: Vibration

Fretting
Damage Condition
Wear occurs due to repeated sliding 
between the two surfaces.
Fretting occurs at fi tting surface and also 
at contact area between raceway and 
rolling elements.
Fretting corrosion is another term used to 
describe the reddish brown or black wear 
debris.
Possible Cause
・Incorrect lubrication
・Vibration with a small amplitude
・Insuffi cient interference
Measures depending on the operating conditions
●Use a proper lubricant
●Apply preload
●Check the interference fi t
●Apply a fi lm of lubricant to the fi tting 
surface
●Part: Cage of a deep groove ball bearing
●Symptom: Fracture of pressed-steel cage-pocket
Bearing Damage and Countermeasures
Cage Damage
Damage Condition
Cage damage includes cage 
deformation, fracture, and 
wear.
・Fracture of cage pillar
・Deformation of side face
・Wear of pocket surface
・Wear of guide surface
Possible Cause
・Incorrect mounting (Bearing 
misalignment)
・Incorrect  handling
・Large moment load
・Shock and large vibration
・Excessive rotation speed, 
sudden acceleration and 
deceleration
・Incorrect lubrication
・Temperature rise
Measures depending on the operating conditions
Measures depending on the bearing
●Check the mounting 
method
●Check the temperature, 
rotation, and load conditions
●Reduce the vibration
● Select a cage type
●Select a lubrication method 
and lubricant
●Cage selection revision
