Dimensional standards  
ISO 12240–4 

The international standard sets the dimensions of rods with spherical bearing 
assembled. It also specifies tolerances relative to the dimensions. 

The diameter of the head d2 is sized at the lower value of the standard, which 
gives our rod-end bearings minimal size and weight, thus ensuring total 
interchangeability with any other rod-end bearing meeting the standard.

Static loading 
The basic static loading C0 is given in the tables of dimensions. 
For a rod-end bearing, it is limited by the strength of the mount. 

The values given in the Unibal standard programme tables are calculated from the 
elastic limit of the mount material (Cse) taking a safety factor into account: 

Cse 
C0 =
1.25 

In the case of a spherical bearing, the basic static loading C0 is calculated using 
the following formula: 

C0 =
dk x C x 0.85 x X 

dK: diameter of the inner bush sphere (mm) 
C: 
width of the mount (mm) 
X: 
Stress admissible by the material (daN.mm-2) 

Fatigue resistance: Please note that values given in the tables of dimensions are 
for occasional static loadings. Ask us where fatigue resistance is required. 

Axial static loading  

The following table gives the values for the axial static loading not to be exceeded 
for spherical and rod-end bearings.

.50,.51 and .52

SME/SFE/SMEM/SSE 
8% C0 
SM/SF SMG/SFG SS/SSA
20% C0 
C0: Basic static loading (see tables of dimensions pages 24 to 47) 

In the case of rod-end bearings, it must also be ensured that the thread is properly 
located so as to prevent any risk of buckling or stripping of the rod-end bearing 
shank. 
In the case of spherical bearings (SS, SSA, SSE), attention must be paid to 
maintaining the cage axially (see assembly instructions chapter, page 23)

Calculating specific 
pressure 

Coefficient of axial loading y and equivalent dynamic loading: 
─ 
Our spherical bearings are designed to withstand radial loadings (Fr). But 
the combination with an axial loading (Fa) is sometimes inevitable and 
spherical bearings are able to accommodate it to a certain extant. So the 
equivalent dynamic loading F must be calculated taking into account a 
correction factor y for that axial loading. The table opposite gives the value 
of y for different Fa / Fr ratios. 

F = Fr + (y x Fa) 
Normal case: F = Fr 

Checking the average pressure according to the force exercised on the friction 
surface.

P =
dK x C x 0.85 

P: pressure (daN.mm-2) 
F: total dynamic loading (daN) 
Fr: radial dynamic loading (daN) 
Fa: axial dynamic loading (daN) 
dK: diameter of the inner sphere bush (mm) 
C: width of the mount or cage (mm)

Determining calculation 
coefficients 

The life of a spherical bearing or rod is the maximum number of running hours or 
oscillations before play appears that does not allow the spherical bearing to fulfil its 
function. 
The life is a function of the dynamic strain and of the various parameters of the 
application. 
─ 
Pressure 
─ 
Velocity (angle and frequency of oscillations) 
─ 
Strain (continuous, pulsating, alternate loadings) 
─ 
Temperature 
─ 
Vibrations 

Calculation formulas, worked out from trials conducted on our test benches, enable 
you to determine the life in accordance with your application. 

In the case of a pulsating or alternate loading, the value to use for F is the absolute 
maximum value reached. 

To determine it correctly, all possible data should be taken into consideration – no 
unknowns should remain that could invalidate the result. 
For specific uses in a particular environment (corrosion, vibration, aggressive 
ambient environment, abrasive dust, etc.), please ask us.

After checking the values obtained in table 1, we find that the 
maximum admissible PV factor is 3.5, the limit admissible 
velocity is 5 m/min. and the pressure maximum admissible is 5 
daN/mm2 
So we can continue the calculation. 

3) Calculating the life 

PV = P x V = 6.9 x 0.015 = 0.1 

We have to choose a rod-end bearing withstanding 10daN/mm2, 
so steel /steel friction. Type SMGM 16.50 does not withstand 
very high velocities, but in this application, the velocity is very 
low. An SMGM 16.50 is particularly suited to this application.

Calculation n°3: Steel / Uniflon® E 
An SF..30 rod-end bearing is going to be used for the 
transmission on a fairground ride. It must be able to run 
maintenance-free. What type should be used? 

1) Data 
Calculation n°4: Steel / Steel 
Several type SSA 3.45 spherical bearings are fitted to 
scale models (model boats). Despite the corrosive 
environment and stresses, these Unibals must withstand 
300,000 oscillations.

= 0.50 m/min 

PV = P x V = 2.32 x 0.21 = 0.49 

After checking the values obtained in table 1, we find that the 
pressure, velocity and PV factor are below the maximum 
admissible values. Checking the static loading of an SFE30: 
5,130 daN, which is thus greater than the loading stated. 
So the SFE30 is suitable for this application. 

3) Calculating the life 

PV = P x V = 6.26 x 0.5 = 3.12 

After checking the values obtained, we find that the velocity and 
PV factor are acceptable. As concerns pressure, an SSA 3.45 
withstands pressure of 10 daN/mm2. The admissible static 
loading is much greater than 190 daN. So we now have to 
check the required number of oscillations.

Uniflon® Type E 
Uniflon® is the registered trademark of the self-lubricating fabric fitted exclusively to 
Unibal® self-lubricating spherical bearings. 
Uniflon® E self-lubricating fabric comes from a development for aerospace 
applications and complies with the SAE-AS81820 standard. 

Uniflon® E can be used in combination with different materials such as toughened 
steel, aluminium and titanium, in various environments and extreme temperatures 
from –30°C to +175°C. 

Because of its composition, Uniflon® E is unique in the PTFE 
(Polytetrafluoroethylene) fibre friction materials range 

Composition 
The perfect composite, Uniflon® E brings you the following benefits: 
─ 
A fabric (fibres) that is highly resistant to heat, abrasion, breaking and 
compression. 
─ 
A high proportion of PTFE fibres, which have superb slip properties. 
─ 
A matrix chemically linked by a resin with a low coefficient of friction. 

Features 
Spherical bearings with self-lubricating linings do not have a constant coefficient of 
friction for all applications. If the applied loading increases, the coefficient of friction 
decreases. Similarly, if the temperature decreases, the coefficient of friction 
increases. 
The following figure shows how the in the coefficient of friction reduces as the 
temperature rises. 

Alternatives 
For applications at low loadings, high temperature and/or higher velocity, we 
suggest a self-lubricating lining with more suitable characteristics: 
─ 
Uniflon® type VV 

On request, we make other maintenance-free formulas such as: 
─ 
Plastic materials 
─ 
Self-lubricating bronzes

Lubrication and 
maintenance 
Lubrication and the maintenance apply to products not fitted with self-lubricating 
fabric (Uniflon®), i.e. spherical bearings and rod-end bearings of SMG/SFG, 
SS/SSA type - whose the slip contact is of the following type: 
─ 
Steel / bronze 
─ 
Steel / steel 
These products are built so that an internal groove carries the lubricating liquid to 
the slip surface. 

Regular lubrication is necessary for two reasons: 
─ 
To provide the application with optimal running conditions to extend its life. 
─ 
To prevent corrosion, mainly due to steel/steel friction  

Our rod-end bearings, from size 8, are fitted with a small lubricator, in order to 
minimise weakening mounts – symbol G (SMG.., SFG..) 
The lubrication tip to use is the one designed for type D concave head lubricators. 
Standard lubrication  
The Mobil Greaserex 47 grease (ISO 3498 XM2) is used for assembling all types 
of product where grease is necessary. 
This universal grease is an ideal lubricant. 
Features: 
─ 
Base: calcium complex 
─ 
Drop point: 260°C 
─ 
Working temperature: -25°C to +125°C 
─ 
Excellent wear protection properties  
─ 
Withstands shearing. Binding of the bearing possible, partial lining given 
when substantial vibration. 
Special lubrication 
We offer different types of lubrication and surface treatment, on request. For 
example: 
1) Molykote BR2 plus, very haute quality grease: 
─ 
Base: lithium soap, mineral oil 
─ 
Drop point: 185°C 
─ 
Working temperature: -30°C to +130°C 
─ 
Multifunction grease containing solid lubricants 
─ 
Excellent properties under extreme pressure and ideally suited to high 
velocities 
─ 
A permanent film of grease ensures safety and extends lubrication 
intervals 
This grease is recommended for very high stress levels (loading or velocity). 
2) Moly-PAUL PBC, synthetic grease, organo-metallic complex: 
─ 
Excellent anti-corrosive. 
─ 
Excellent resistance to salt, acid and bases. 
─ 
Excellent seizure prevention. 
─ 
Does not carbonise or run at temperature 
─ 
Provides long-lasting lubrication 
─ 
Working temperatures: -10°C to 1,100°C for static (300°C for dynamic, 
slow movement) 
3) Molykote 106, slip coating: 
─ 
Before assembly, the sphere is treated to ensure lasting lubrication. Once 
created, the film reduces wear and optimises operating safety even after 
long stationary periods.

Play 
Spherical bearings and rod-end bearings have initial play or slip torque that is 
specific to the type and size. 
Working play is typified by the radial and axial movements of the inner bush. 
For our standard construction, the relationship between the radial and axial play is 
as follows: 
Axial play = Radial play x 2.5 
Play given in the table below is the max. value for our standard spherical bearings, 
tested under a loading of ±10 daN. 
Some of our products are routinely assembled with reduced play, or even without 
play (types in bold):  
─ 
Series .40 and .50 (all types) 
─ 
Self-lubricated types (all series)

These play values are valid for parts of SM/SMG, SF/SFG, SS/SSA type in the 
standard series and.45 (stainless steel) series 

Torque 
The spherical bearing’s torque can be measured in relation to two perpendicular 
axes. 
There is: 
─ 
rotation torque  
─ 
tilt torque. 
For parts in this catalogue, there is the relationship: 
Rotation torque 
Tilt torque =
1.6 
The torque given in the table below are for the min. and max. values tested. 

General rules 
1) The torque should be reduced for high velocity applications (low loading). 
If there must be no play for your application, we offer variants with reduced 
play or even without play, to your requirements. 
2) The torque should be raised for applications with high or alternating loadings, 
or with impacts and low velocity. 
3) An abnormally short life can result from inappropriate torque. For non-standard 
applications, we offer advice and will adapt the torque to your requirements for 
optimal running.

Assembly instructions  
After assembly, there must be slip between the inner bush and outer bush of the 
spherical bearing. To achieve this, the inner bush should be firmly fixed to the 
shaft, and the outer bush fixed to the housing in which it is fitted. 

1) Fitting the spherical bearing in its housing 
To ensure correct operation, it is important to comply with adjustments when fitting. 
It is advisable to tighten spherical bearings in their housing in accordance with the 
values in the following table: 

Size 
Self-lubricated 
spherical bearings 
Metal/Metal 
spherical bearings 
2 to 4 
0.000 to 0.010mm 
0.005 to 0.015mm 
5 to 8 
0.005 to 0.015mm 
0.010 to 0.020mm 
10 to 16 
0.005 to 0.020mm 
0.010 to 0.025mm 
18 to 30 
0.005 to 0.025mm 
0.010 to 0.030mm 

Parts should be assembled using a press. Tooling used should ensure perfect 
alignment of the axis of the spherical bearing and the axis housing when 
assembling. There should be a 10 to 20° chamfer on the housing so as to facilitate 
seating. 

Caution: 
The fixture of the spherical bearing in its housing is not under any circumstances a 
mechanical stop keeping the spherical bearing from movement due to an axial 
loading. 
To prevent the cage from slipping, bearing surfaces or stop segments should be 
provided or it must be crimped. 

2) Fitting the shaft in the bush 
For self-lubricated spherical bearings, it is essential that the shaft is dry-fitted. An 
m6 adjustment will be used for the standard and stainless steel series with 
steel/steel friction contact, and a k6 adjustment for all other lines. 

Incorrect assembly can adversely affect the life of the spherical bearing. A very 
high proportion of failures directly related to incorrect assembly. 
Here are some examples of common mistakes: 
─ 
Adjustment too tight between the spherical bearing and the housing. 
─ 
Unsuitable tools used for assembly 
─ 
Excess force applied when assembling. 

Materials 
The materials of the different constituents of Unibal standard spherical bearings, 
shown on the following pages, are given as an indication. 
We reserve the right to change them for other materials with similar properties that 
do not alter the mechanical characteristics of spherical bearings.
