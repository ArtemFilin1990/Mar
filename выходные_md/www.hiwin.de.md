Linear Guideway

A linear guideway facilitates linear movement using ball 
bearings. Thanks to the use of ball bearings between the rail 
and the block, it is possible for a linear guideway to achieve 
extremely precise linear movement. In comparison with a 
conventional guide rail, the friction coefﬁ cient is still only one 
ﬁ ftieth. Due to the restricted guidance of the block on the 
rail, linear guideways can carry loads in both a vertical and 
horizontal direction.

1.1 Linear Guideway Series HG / EG
1.1.1 Special characteristics of the linear guideway series HG and EG
The super heavy duty HIWIN linear guideways of the HG/ EG series, with four ball bearing 
paths, are designed for loads and rigidity 30 % higher than with similar products. This 
is thanks to optimization of the running arc and its construction. The system also owes 
its light running to the optimal design of the recirculation system.
The retainers prevent the ball bearings from falling out, in particular when the block is 
pulled off the rail during installation.
1.1.2 Construction of the HG and EG series

 Recirculation system: block, rail, end cap and retainers

Lubrication system: Lubricating nipple; optional: lubrication adapter

 Dust protection: End seal, bottom seal, cover cap; optional: double seals, 
scraper (see Chapter 1.1.9)
1.1.3 Article numbers for the HG series
Linear guideways are available as either interchangeable or non-interchangeable 
versions. The dimensions of both models are identical. The interchangeable models are 
more user friendly, as the block and rail can be replaced freely. However, 
accuracy is lower than that of the non-interchangeable models. Due to the strict 
control of dimensional accuracy, the interchangeable models are a good choice for 
customers not using pairs of rails on a stage. The article numbers include the dimensi-
ons, model, accuracy class and preload class etc.

1.1.6 Preload
 Deﬁ nition 
A preload can be applied to any rails version. For this purpose, oversized balls are 
used. Normally a linear guideway has a negative clearance between the path and 
the ball bearings, to increase rigidity and precision. The curve shows that rigidity 
doubles with a high preload. A preload not larger than ZA would be recommended 
for all model sizes under HG20 to avoid a reduction of service life.

1.1.9 Coated Linear Guideways
Depending on the application, various coatings are available. The 
properties and ﬁ elds of use of the coatings are listed below.
It is possible to coat the rail only, or to coat both the rail and the block.
All coatings are free of chromium 6 components.
HICOAT 1
Type of coating:  

Phosphatization
Layer thickness: 

 > 10μm
Color: 

black
Properties:   

Basic corrosion protection

e.g. as transport protection for see freight
The coating is soft and works itself into the base material and is consequently not
suitable for use with blocks with a high pre-tension and loading.
HICOAT 2
Type of coating:  

Thin-layer chromium plating
Layer thickness: 

2 - 4μm
Color: 

matt gray
Salt spray testing DIN 50021SS  
> 20 h
Properties:  

Protection against wear for mixed friction
Due to the high hardness level of the coating, this has no inﬂ uence on loading capacity
and service life.
HICOAT 3
Type of coating:  

Two layer chromium plating
Layer thickness: 

4 - 6μm
Color: 

black
Salt spray testing DIN 50021SS  
> 100 h
Properties:   

HICOAT 3 is a further development of the HICOAT  

coating Double coating with an additional 

“top coat”.

Protection against wear in the event of a lack of  

lubrication
Due to the high hardness level of the coating, this has no inﬂ uence on loading capacity
and service life.

n = (Number of ﬁ xing holes)
Note: 1. The tolerance for E is 0 to –1 mm for standard, for joint connections 0 to –0.3 mm

2. If no information is provided on the E1/2dimensions, the maximum number of ﬁ xing holes is determined taking into account E1/2min 

3. The rails are shortened to the desired length. If no information on the E1/2dimensions is provided, then the rails are manufactured symmetrically.

Table 1.18: Tightening torque for ﬁ xing screws to DIN 912-12.9
1.1.11 Rail length
HIWIN offers customer-speciﬁ c lengths. To ensure that the ends of the rails for non-
standard lengths are stable, value E must not exceed half the distance between the ﬁ xing 
holes (P). In addition, value E1/2 must not be less than E1/2 min and must not exceed E1/2 
max to prevent breakage of the ﬁ xing hole.
Table 1.19: Maximum rail lengths 
L : 
Total rail length [mm]
n : 
Number of ﬁ xing holes
P : 
Distance between two ﬁ xing holes [mm]
E1/2 :  Distance from the center of the last ﬁ xing hole to the end of 
the rail [mm]

1.2.5  Application
The MGN/MGW series can be used in many different areas, for example, in the semi-
conductor industry, in component insertion machinery, medical technology, industrial 
robots, measuring equipment, in ofﬁ ce automation and in other areas that need 
miniature versions. 
1.2.6 Article numbers for the MGN/MGW series
Linear guideways are available as either interchangeable or non-interchangeable 
versions. The dimensions of both models are identical. The interchangeable models 
are more user friendly as the block and rail can be replaced freely. However, accuracy 
is lower than that of the non-interchangeable models. Due to the strict control of 
dimensional accuracy, the interchangeable models are a good choice for customers 
not using pairs of rails on a stage. The article numbers include the dimensions, model, 
accuracy class and preload etc.

1.2.7 Accuracy classes
The MG series is divided into three classes according to 
respective accuracy - normal (C), high precision (H) and 
precision class (P). The correct rail can be determined 
according to the requirements of the machinery in which 
it is used.
1. Non-interchangeable models
The characteristics refer to the mean dimensions 
determined at the central section of the block.

2. Interchangeable models
Due to the height tolerance with several sets of pairs, 
there are some differences between the interchangeable 
and non-interchangeable models. 
3. Parallelism tolerance
The parallelism from C to A and D to B is dependent on 
the length of the rail.

1.2.9 Dust protection equipment
Closing seals are ﬁ tted as standard to both ends of the block, guaranteeing accuracy 
and a long service life. Bottom seals are ﬁ tted to the sides of the block to prevent 
contamination. Bottom seals can be ordered using the “+U” code, followed by the 
article number for the model. Bottom seals are available as an option for sizes 12 und 
15, for sizes 7 and 9, they cannot be ﬁ tted due to the restricted installation area H1. 
For installation of a bottom seal, the lateral installation surface of the rail must not 
exceed value H1.

1.2.11 Maximum rail length
To ensure that the ends of rails for non-standard lengths are stable, value E must not 
exceed half the distance between the ﬁ xing holes (P). In addition, value E1/2 must not 
be less than E1/2 min and must not exceed E1/2 max to prevent breakage of 
the ﬁ xing hole.
Table 1.26:
Note: 
1. The tolerance for E for standard rail is 0.5 to –0. mm, for ﬂ ush joints 0 to – 0.3 mm

2.  Type “M” is manufactured in stainless steel

3.  If no information is provided on the E1/2dimensions, the maximum number of ﬁ xing holes are determined taking into account E1/2min

Ballscrews
32

---

Ballscrews, consist of a ballscrew shaft and ballscrew nut, 
within which the balls and a ball return system are inte-
grated. Ballscrews are the most commonly used threaded 
spindles in industrial and precision machine tools, converting 
a rotary movement into a linear movement, and vice versa. 
Ballscrews offer high accuracy in combination with high ef-
ﬁ ciency. HIWIN offers a wide range of different ballscrews to 
suit your respective application.
The distinguishing features of HIWIN ballscrews are low-fric-
tion, accurate running, a low drive torque requirement and 
a high level of rigidity combined with quiet operation. HIWIN 
has state-of-the-art production facilities, highly qualiﬁ ed 
engineers, quality-assured manufacturing and assembly 
processes, using only high-quality materials to satisfy your 
demands.
This catalogue provides technical information to help you to 
choose the right ballscrew for your application.

Linear stages with ballscrew (KK stages)

HIWIN linear stages (KK stages) are compact positioning 
stages. The advance is generated by a ballscrew, which is 
mounted in a drive ﬂ ange ready to use by the motor. Mo-
vement is guided by a linear guideway. Various equipment 
versions and sizes adapt the linear stages to very different 
tasks and industries.
