Materials
Balls
Hybrid ball bearings are characterized by a combination of materials; 
bearing steel (inner and outer rings) and ceramic (balls). 
The material-based characteristics of ceramic balls (in comparison to 
bearings with steel balls) offer clear performance improvements, 
especially under critical conditions in machine operation. 
Balls (hybrid ball bearings)
balls (standard material)
Material
Bearing steel (chrome steel) 100 Cr 6 
Material no. 1.3505, SAE 52100, SUJ2 
Special steels on request
Permissible operating temperature
Heat treated for continuous operating temperatures 
up to 150°C
Hardness
60 to 64 HRC, fully hardened; corresponds to 700–800 HV30
Characteristics 
High purity and homogeneity, vacuum-degassed
Material
Ceramic (silicon nitride Si3N4)
Material characteristics
·	Low chemical affinity to 100 Cr 6
·	Low friction coefficient
·	Low heat conductivity
·	Corrosion resistance
·	Non magnetic
·	Electrically insulating
Hybrid ball bearings
Longer service life
Because of their material characteristics, hybrid bearings are able 
to attain more than twice the service life of steel bearings.
Machine operation time is significantly increased.
Higher speeds
Due to their tribological characteristics and lower mass forces, 
speeds can be increased as much as 30% in comparison with steel 
balls.
Low-cost lubrication
The maximum speed for grease and oil lubrication is increased.
Therefore grease lubrication can frequently be use instead of cost-
intensive oil lubrication.
Greater rigidity
The characteristics of the materials improve both radial and axial 
rigidity. The advantages here are increased accuracy and a shift of 
critical resonance.
Improved machining accuracy 
Greater bearing rigidity, reduced thermal expansion and lower 
vibration excitation make it possible to achieve maximum process­
ing accuracy.

Rings and balls
Hybrid ball bearings are characterized by a combination of materials; 
bearing steel (inner and outer rings) and ceramic (balls). The material-
based characteristics of ceramic balls (in comparison to bearings with 
steel balls) offer clear performance improvements, especially under 
intense operational conditions in machine utilization.

Engineering

GMN high precision bearings provide intelligent bearing solutions 
for peak performance machine components. 
The outstanding characteristics of GMN ball bearings are the result 
of technically sophisticated quality features that attain maximum 
power limits.
The values stated in the bearing data indicate the performance 
potential of the individual bearing depending on characteristic 
design and material properties.
Influences due to operating conditions can affect specific bearing 
characteristics and cause deviations from the stated bearing data.
There are various measures which can be taken to counteract 
performance restrictions and improve bearing performance.
·	Bearing selection
· Preloading
· Accuracy of associated components
· Lubrication
· Operating conditions
Bearing selection
On the basis of GMN's comprehensive array of products, the specific 
performance profiles of individual bearing designs can be used to 
select just the right bearing to meet a given set of requirements.  
e.g. spindle, motor
Installed location: drawing, space available, bearing arrangement (fixed/
floating bearing) 
Application profile: precision, rigidity, operating temperature, 
load capacity, speed, service life, duty cycle
Bearing design (materials, bearing type, series, bearing size, cage) 
Precision, contact angle, preload (rigid or with spring) 
Installation drawing, fastening, surrounding parts (fits, abutment dimensions)
Lubrication: Plan for supply/disposal, quantities/cycles, 
nozzles or bore holes in outer ring 
Grease lubrication: type of grease (viscosity, ndm factor), grease quantity, 
grease resupply system if required
Operational bearing loads (radial/axial loads)
Permissible static load
Speed limits
Assessment of extended service life
Assessment of grease consumption period
Associated components: shaft, housing, connecting parts; 
Tightening force and torque for bearing fastener

Preload is defined as a continuously acting axial force exerted on 
a ball bearing which produces elastic deformation in the contact 
area of balls and raceways. 
The installation of ball bearings with rigid or with spring preload op­
timizes numerous performance characteristics for bearing operation.
· Reduced spring action establishes definable  
	 radial and axial rigidity (see diagram) 
·	High running accuracy/processing accuracy even under 
	 changing load conditions
· Reduced vibrations and running noise
· Prevention of slippage and mixed friction for rolling element contact 
	 at high speeds and high acceleration
· Reduced amounts of sliding friction  at high speeds
	 (reduced contact angle change between inner 
	 and outer ring)
· Increase of load capacity (by external loads and  
	 speeds) with longer service life
Preload
Rigidity
Rigidity is defined as the magnitude of axial force [N] on a ball 
bearing which causes the bearing's rings to be displaced toward 
one another by 1 µm. 
Appropriate preload increases bearing rigidity and supports 
the bearing's loading capacity against applied forces.
Lift-off force
The force at which a bearing becomes free of load by an axial load 
acting centrally on a bearing set is defined as lift-off force. 
If the external axial load exceeds the lift-off force …
... balls and raceways of the relieved ball bearing
	  are no longer in permanent contact 
... wear increases due to increased sliding friction
Line of flux
Preloaded bearing pair
Non-preloaded bearing pair
Clearance
Structural features:
· Bearing 1 (work side) is axially fixed in the housing
	 Bearing 2 is axially floating 
	 (fixed seating position of the inner ring on the shaft)
· The spring force on the outer ring of bearing 2 produces 
	 a constant preload on both bearings.
· The required spring preload is adjusted via the spring travel 
	 (travel-force function corresponding to the 
	 spring characteristic)
· To achieve perfect preload results, sufficient axial
	 freedom of motion is required for the floating bearing's 
	 outer ring
· The positioning spring is adjusted in the effective direction 
	 of the external axial load 
· If single bearings are employed: < ~> , these bearings can be 
	 unmatched
· If a tandem bearing arrangement is employed, ( <<   ~>> ) 
	 matched bearings ( L, M or S ) ensure 
	 uniform load distribution
Characteristics:
·	The preload results – independent of speed and
	 temperature – exclusively from spring force
· The spring force exerts a constant preload on the bearing 
	 and counter bearing
· Thermal expansion of the shaft and housing have no 
	 influence on preload
· Spring preloaded bearing systems permit the greatest  
	 speeds

Preload
Structural features: 
·	Bearing 1 (work side) and bearing 2 have axially and radially 
	 fixed positions (inner rings sit firmly on the shaft and outer rings 	
	 in the housing)
· The contact surfaces of associated components to the inner and 
	 outer ring have equal length and are plane parallel
· To achieve the predefined preload, it is necessary for the 
	 respective bearings to be matched
Characteristics:
· Substantially increased axial and radial rigidity 
	 (in comparison to spring preload)
·	As friction heat increases as a consequence of increased speed, 	
	 preload increases to reduce maximum speed
	 (in comparison to spring preload)
	 The theoretical maximum speed can be calculated 
	 on the basis of speed correction factors
· Temperature differences between shaft (inner ring) and 
	 housing (outer ring) lead to preload changes due to thermal 	
	 expansion
	 If the shaft's temperature is higher than that of the housing, 
	 the bearing's radial clearance decreases
	 Very high temperature differences and small contact angles 
	 can cause radial tension
· With small bearing spacing, a temperature gradient from
	 shaft to housing causes an increase of preload 
· With large bearing spacing, a temperature gradient from
	 shaft to housing causes a decrease of preload
· The change of preload under operating conditions must
	 be considered in the design
GMN provides software solutions to perform the complex calculation 
for required bearing preload; these programs embody many years 
of practical experience which lead to reliable preload results.
Rigid preload: Single bearings
Bearing 1
Bearing 2
Rigid preload: Bearing sets
Multiple arrangements of bearings to form bearing sets increase 
load capacity, rigidity and lift-off force. 
* Reference values for bearing pairs in O or X arrangement (see bearing data). 
Influences due to operating conditions (e.g. speed, load) are not taken into account.

Bearing pairs
(multiple arrangements with 2 bearings)
For rigid bearing preload, matched bearing pairs in O, X or tandem 
arrangement provide an effective economic and technical solution 
to a large number of applications.
O arrangement (DB)
Pressure lines diverge in the direction of the bearing's axis
·	Wide support base (H) and high rigidity against tilting moments 
·	Axial force absorption in both directions
X arrangement (DF)
Pressure lines converge in the direction of the bearing's axis
·	Insensitive to misalignment 
·	Reduced support base size and tilt rigidity
·	Axial force absorption in both directions
Tandem arrangement (DT)
Arranged parallel to load direction 
·	Higher axial load capacity (factor 2) than a single bearing
·	Both bearings have the same contact angle and are 
	 placed against a third bearing

Spacers
Distinct optimization of individual quality features with paired bearings can be achieved by the 
installation of spacers. 
The width of the spacer must be at least as wide as a single bearing.
Spacer between differing pressure line courses
Structural features:
·	Material: 100 Cr6, or other, hardened (>=45 HRC)
·	The required plane parallelism of outer and inner spacer is guaranteed  
	 by surface grinding both rings in one clamping operation
Detailed information on the difference dimension of spacer rings:
www.gmn.de
Characteristics:	
·	Enlarge the support base (H) and increase radial rigidity 
·	Optimize thermal dissipation
·	Improve bearing lubrication by optimized oil flow
·	Change of preload with matched bearings is possible
·	If the width of the shaft spacer is smaller than the width of the housing spacer then …
	 … preload will be increased with the O arrangement
	 … preload will be decreased with X arrangement
·	For bearing sets with spacers (e.g. <||<||>||>), only the spacer between
 	different pressure line courses must be ground off
Spacer width
Matching accuracy
General matching
The general matching accuracy of ± 2µm provides for uniform load 
absorption and a constant operating temperature in multiple 
arrangements.
Mated matching
A highly precise matching accuracy of ±1µm (on request) increases 
the speed suitability of mated matched bearing pairs/sets even 
further.  
Suffix for order designation: X-opt., O-opt. or T-opt.
Standard contact angle 
C (15°) and E (25°)
Deviating contact angles:
Other contact angles can be delivered on request.
Contact angle α0
The angle of the lines between contact points: 
Inner ring raceway – Ball – Outer ring raceway 
and the radial plane define the contact angle. 
The contact angle is determined by design as a function of radial 
clearance and the bevel form of the raceways.
Load transmissions between both bearing rings take place 
over the contact points formed by the raceways and the balls. 
Uniform load distribution on individual bearings of bearing 
arrangements presupposes the same contact angle of all loaded 
bearings. 
The contact angle changes due to operating conditions by …
... external forces
... internal forces 
	  (centrifugal force of inner ring and balls at high speeds)
... inner ring fits 
... temperature differences between inner and outer ring.
Deviations of the contact angle induce changes in bearing 
characteristics which influence bearing operation.
With increasing contact angle …
... axial rigidity increases
... maximum permissible speed decreases
... radial rigidity decreases

Precision
of associated components
Installation preparation
The processing quality of bearing seats and the precision of the 
selected fits decisively influence the performance of the installed 
bearing.
Operational availability of maximum ball bearing performance 
increases with the precision of the relevant machine environment. 
Careful installation preparations on decisive machine components 
ensure necessary surface quality and guarantee compliance 
with the tolerances for shape and position of bearing seats.
Long-term and extensive practical experience has revealed specific 
guidelines with respect to necessary precision tolerances for as­
sociated components that will permit optimal bearing utilization.

Optimization of the fit 
at high speeds 
With increasing speeds (from about n · dm = 1.5 · 106mm/min) progres­
sively  rising  centrifugal  force can cause widening of the inner ring 
and lead to the following functional impairments. 
·	 Inner ring slippage on the shaft 
	 and contact surfaces
·	 Fretting corrosion
·	 Vibrations
A tighter fit is recommended to prevent the inner ring from lifting off.

Lubricant selection 
In order to fully exploit the performance capacity of GMN high 
precision bearings in machine operation, it is especially important 
to consider suitable bearing lubrication. 
Maximum speeds as well as maximum service life are based on the 
formation of a friction-reducing lubricant film between rolling and 
sliding bearing parts. 
Other objectives of lubrication are:
· Attenuation of structure noise and vibrations 
· Thermal dissipation
· Sealing effect
· Corrosion protection
The increasing speed viability of modern high-speed lubricants 
permits greater utilization of the user-friendly, economic advantages 
of grease lubrication.
Operational requirements which exceed the performance capability of 
grease lubricants can be handled by oil-lubricated bearings to obtain 
maximum service life at the highest speed and temperature ranges. 
Criteria for lubrication type selection
Bearing lubrication
Speed suitability of greases 
Selection of a suitable grease for high precision bearings is essentially 
based on the bearing's maximum operating speed. 
The reference speed factor, n · dm, accommodates the operational 
speed of the bearing and indicates the maximum speed capacity 
of the lubricant sought.
Accommodation of the speed factor when selecting a lubricant 
precludes degradation of bearing performance due to deficient 
lubrication. 
A speed-induced break-down of the lubrication film can lead to 
mixed friction, heating, and increased wear on the bearing.
	 	Reference speed factor: n · dm
	 	n · dm bearing = n · (D + d)/2 [mm/min]
	 	n: Bearing operating speed [1/min]
	 	d: Bearing bore diameter [mm]
	 	D: Bearing outer diameter [mm]
Numerous lubricant manufacturers offer a comprehensive range 
of greases developed for use with high speed or heavily loaded ball 
bearings. 
Particular characteristics, such as protection against wear, low noise 
level and temperature resistance, are specifically emphasized during 
production by an application-oriented combination or processing 
of the base oil, thickener and additives.

Oil lubrication systems
Compared to grease-lubricated bearings, the application of lubricat­
ing oils enables long-term reliable operation at maximum speeds.
Different methods are available for the supply of oil to high speed 
bearings:
·	Oil air lubrication (minimum quantity lubrication)
·	Oil injection lubrication
·	Oil fog lubrication
Oil air lubrication
Oil air lubrication provides specific as well as volume-regulated 
lubricant delivery to the rolling and sliding surfaces in the bearing. 
The oil is transported by means of an air stream that form streaks 
along the inner wall of the transparent supply hose and released 
uniformly at lubricating points in specified intervals.
Oil air lubrication guarantees utmost effectiveness with respect to 
consumption and lubricating effect at maximum speeds:
·	Reduced flexing work
·	Minimum friction losses
·	Reduced heat generation
·	High operating security
· Specific, volume-regulated lubricant supply
·	Low oil consumption
·	Low oil fog formation 
· Very good lubricating effect
· Environmentally friendly and highly economical
·	Oil cooling and oil filtering not required
	 (in comparison to oil injection lubrication)

Oil lubrication
Oil supply
Conventional bearing lubrication systems have oil injection nozzles 
in an intermediate sleeve or in a spacer between 2 bearings. 
A nozzle position aligned parallel to the spindle axis is sufficient 
for applications in high speed ranges.
A nozzle position aligned at an angle increases bearing speed 
suitability (more accurate lubricant supply in the rolling area).
Length and bore diameter of the oil nozzle: 
Sufficient lubricant supply is assured with a ratio of nozzle length/
nozzle bore diameter of more than 3 and less than 5 (pressure of oil 
air current greater than opposing pressure generated by bearing 
turbulences).
Oil for high precision spindles: 
Hydraulic oil with kinematic viscosity VG 32 or VG 46mm2/s 
Oil filtering: 
Purity class 13/10 per ISO 4406:99 (particle size < 5µm)
Oil volume per lubrication pulse: 
30 up to 35mm3 per connection for 1 or 2 bearings
Cycle time: 
VG32: 2 to 4min., VG46: 4–10min. (independent of dbearing)
Number of nozzles: 
1 per bearing
Nozzle diameter: 
1.2 mm (dbearing < 50mm) ….. 1.6mm (dbearing > 70mm) 
Nozzle position: 
Between cage and inner ring rim (technical data tables, TA cage)
Oil supply, oil drain: 
Transparent hose, di = 4mm
Air pressure upstream of spindle: 
0,6 to 1 bar
Air volume: 
3 to 4m3/h (50 to 65 L/min)
Air quality: 
Meets ISO 8573: particle size < 5µm, 
particle concentration < 5mg/m3, 
dew point < 3°C, oil concentration < 1mg/m3
Start-up: 
Spindle start-up only after oil supply is secured

Direct oil lubrication 
GMN special designs for direct oil lubrication enable compact 
bearing dimensions because of an oil supply bore in the outer ring 
(no spacer for oil supply required) which also permits economical 
lubricant regulation. 
· saves installation space and costs
	 (no axial injection nozzle/intermediate sleeve required)
· Reduced consumption of compressed air and oil
	 (better dosage of lubricant volume)
·	Separate lubricant volume regulation per single bearing
· Specific lubricant supply to roller contact points
· Less sensitive to axial air current 
	 (in comparison to conventional oil air lubrication)
GMN offers special designs for direct oil lubrication which provide 
versatile and effective solutions with respect to oil supply and 
effective sealing.
·	Oil supply through outer ring, open side 
·	Oil supply through outer ring, shielded side 
· O-rings in outer ring (sealing)
· Broadened groove for expanded oil supply potential, 
	 tolerance compensation

GMN develops ball bearings for highest speed and maximum load 
to optimize the efficiency and service life of machines. A bearing's 
speed limit is a decisive quantity. As speed increases, the running 
friction – and thus bearing temperature – rises progressively in the 
area of contact surfaces between balls and rings.

Storage
Appropriate storage of GMN products assures their bearing-specific 
performance features until installation.
·	Store bearings in their original packaging 
·	Protect them from dust and moisture
·	Protect them from temperature and moisture fluctuations
Shelf-life of preserved, grease-lubricated ball bearings: 
Max. 2 years (in proper storage)
Installation preparation
Careful preparation of the installation environment and relevant 
components assure unrestricted utilization of GMN ball bearing 
performance characteristics.
Preparation of the installation environment
·	Keep the installation environment clean and free of dust and 
	 compressed air 
·	Have necessary measuring and assembly tools at hand
·	Allow all parts to adapt to the prevailing temperature
·	Clean associated components
·	Check condition and dimensions of associated components 
Preparing components
·	Unpack ball bearings just before installation
·	Do not rinse out ball bearings. Most greases and lubricating oils 
	 are entirely compatible with the bearing's preservative oil.
Preparation for grease lubrication: 
·	Have the necessary type and quantity (precision scales) of grease
	 at hand 
·	Spread grease on both sides of the balls / raceways with a
 	dosing syringe.
Bearing installation
·	Match the dimensions of the bearings and associated components 	
	 to one another (fits)
·	Push or pull ball bearings in the axial direction precisely
	 (do not cant)
·	Do not transmit installation force through the balls
·	When press fitting, warm the inner ring (maximum 100°C). 
	 (note: axial shrinkage due to cooling)
Detailed installation information: www.gmn.de
Grease distribution run 
The necessary grease distribution run ensures uniform bearing 
lubrication and optimally distributes grease in the bearing (grease 
thickener is purged from the ball rolling area and base oil wets the 
lubricating point evenly).
·	Reduced flexing work 
·	Low bearing temperature
·	Exploitation of the grease's n · dm factor
·	High operating security
·	Long grease and bearing service life
Notices about grease distribution run
·	Avoid external loads
·	Accelerate to a fraction of nominal speed in about 20 seconds
· Take into account the type of grease (viscosity) and quantity
·	Monitor the development of temperature and noise  
	 (at more than 60°C housing temperature or extreme 
	 noise: stop grease distribution run and
 	resume after a rest period)
·	Smooth running and steady temperature levels 
	 confirm a successfully completed grease distribution run

The use of «precision nuts» for clamping bearings (sets) 
promotes optimal utilization of the performance capacity inherent 
to GMN high precision ball bearings.
Guidelines:
Careful installation with precision nuts prevents contact
corrosion caused by micro movements. 
·	Grind the plane sides of the nut at a right angle to the nut's 	
	 thread and the shaft to prevent bearing tilt or bending of the 	

	 shaft (max. 2µm wobble tolerance)
·	Lock the precision nut on the shaft (against loosening)
· Intermediate spacers / sleeves must be made plane parallel
 	(max. 2µm)
Sufficient axial clamping force fixes the bearing securely into its 
specified position and ensures necessary bearing preload, precision 
and rigidity.
Installation:	
·	Oil the thread lightly
· Tighten precision nut to 2 to 3 times their REFERENCE torque,
	 loosen them again then tighten them down to 
	 their REFERENCE torque
	 (compensation for temperature-induced dimension changes of 
 	rings and settling)
·	The required pressure bonding of multiple bearings (axially) and
	 necessary defeat of bearing friction resistance by the bearing's
	 press fit on the shaft (radially) is assured by the 2 to 3 times initial 
	 tightening torque.

Grease
service life
Lubricating interval
Consideration of the required lubricant service life (lubricating 
interval) is of decisive importance for long-term reliable operation 
of grease lubricated bearings. 
Lubricating intervals of more than 5 years are possible under favorable 
operating conditions. 
The calculation of lubricating interval (tf) is carried out on the basis 
of lubricant characteristics and operationally-induced bearing loads. 
· Grease type, volume and distribution
· Design and bearing type
· Installation conditions (cleanliness) 
· Operating conditions 
	 (speed, reference speed coefficient, loads, temperature, etc.)
Operating conditions* for lubrication interval reference points tf 
· Standard greases on the basis of lithium saponification
·	Operating temperature up to 70°C
·	Bearing load (P/C < 0.1)
·	Favorable ambient conditions with respect to ...
	 ... dust 
	 ...  humidity
	 ... air currents through the bearing
*(according to GfT Worksheet 3, "Roller Bearing Lubrication", Sept. 2006)
Higher operating temperatures cause a reduction of the lubricating 
interval. (Beyond an operating temperature of 70°C, a further heat-
up of 15°Kelvin will lead to a lubricating interval which is only half 
the initial period.)
Higher bearing loads (P/C > 0.1), jerky loads and vibrations require 
appropriate corrections to lubricating interval reference values tf.
If exceptional load conditions prevail, GMN will provide consultation 
about special greases optimized for the specific requirements.

Static
load capacity
Sufficient static load capacity ensures the form-stability of bearing 
components under maximum force influences during operation. 
Particularly during machine standstill (tool changes) and extremely 
slow rotation it is possible for high mechanical loads to occur.
The static load capacity (static coefficient fS) is determined by taking 
into account the bearing characteristics and operating conditions. 
Adequate static load capacity of the bearing is given if the static 
coefficient fS is greater than 2.5, (no plastic deformation of balls/
raceways at the contact point).
	 	Static coefficient fS
	 	fS = i · C0 / P0
	 	i	
: Number of bearings
	 	C0	 : Static load rating  [N]
	 	P0 	 : Static equivalent load  [N]
The static equivalent bearing load P0 is a reference value which 
accommodates various operating and load conditions in a standard­
ized manner for use in the calculation of the static coefficient fs.
	 	Static equivalent load P0 [N]
	 	P0 = X0 · Fr + Y0 · Fa [N]
	 	if P0 < Fr  then  P0 = Fr
	 	X0	 : Radial factor
	 	Y0	 : Axial factor

The influences of bearing type, contact angle and bearing arrangement

Bearing frequencies
Structure-borne noise
The design and geometry of the individual components, as well as 
the design of the entire bearing, determine bearing frequencies. 
The characteristic structure-borne noise level of a ball bearing is 
composed of the sum of all bearing frequencies.
Structure-borne noise relevant factors:
·	Form accuracy and surface grade of 
	 raceways and balls
· Cage version
· Cleanliness and type of lubrication
On the basis of structure-borne noise tests, bearing vibrations can 
be determined and conclusions drawn about the surface condition 
(waviness) of bearing rings and balls. 
Low noise levels are the result of smooth running and low friction 
which indicate high performance and long service life of the bearing.
