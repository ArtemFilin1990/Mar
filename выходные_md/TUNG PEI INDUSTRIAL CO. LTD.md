    Structure and Arrangement
1. 1Bearing Arrangement for Main 
Spindles
Typical examples of bearing arrangements for 
main spindles of machine tools are summarized 
in Table 1.1.  An optimal bearing arrangement 
must be determined through considerations 
about the properties required of the main spindle 
in question (maximum speed, radial and axial 
rigidities, main spindle size, required accuracies, 
lubrication system, etc.). Recently, an increasing 
number of new machine tool models incorporate 
built-in motor type main spindles. However, heat 
generation on a built-in motor can affect the 
accuracy of the main spindle and performance 
of lubricant, so a main spindle bearing should be 
selected very carefully.

1.2 Structure of Spindle Bearings
1.2.1 Duplex Arrangement Bearings
As Fig. 1.1 shows, angular contact ball bearings 
in duplex arrangements vary in combinations 
of two, three or four, in accordance to user's 
required speciﬁcations. Back-to-back duplex 
(DB) arrangement and face-to-face duplex (DF) 
arrangement can both sustain radial and axial 
loads in both directions. The wider distance 
between the effective load centers of the DB 
arrangement allows larger moment loads to be 
handled. The main spindle in machine tools often 
uses this arrangement.
Compared with the DB arrangement, the DF 
arrangement has shorter distance between the 
effective load centers, therefore the capacity 
to handle moment loads is small. However, it 
possesses greater allowable inclination angle than 
the DB arrangement.
The tandem duplex (DT) arrangement is able 
to handle both radial load and large axial load, 
but only in one direction. The four-row duplex 
(DTBT) arrangement is commonly used for the 
main spindles of machining centers because it 
offers high rigidity and accommodates high-speed 
operation.
Fig.1.1 Duplex arrangement codes
1.2.2 Marking of Bearings and Bearing Sets
A “<-shaped” marking on the outside 
surface of the outer rings of matched bearing sets 
indicates how the bearings should be mounted to 
obtain the proper preload in the set. The marking 
also indicates how the bearing set should be 
mounted in relation to the axial load. The ”<” 
should point in the direction in which the axial 
load will act on the inner ring. In applications 
where there are axial loads in both directions, the 
”<”” should point toward the greater of the two 
loads, refer to Fig. 1.2。
For universal combination bearings described 
in 1.2.3, the ”<” marking on the outside surface 
of the outer rings shown in Fig. 1.3, prevent 
“direction” mistakes, ensure correct matching 
when they are mounted.
Fig.1.2 A “<-shaped” marking on the outside 
surface of the outer rings of 
matched bearing sets
Fig.1.3 A “<-shaped” marking on the outside 
surface of the outer rings of 
universal combination bearings
1.2.3 Flush Grinding and Universal Combination
In order to eliminate the face height differences, 
a ﬁnishing technique called "Flush Grinding" is 
used to make sure that the front and back faces 
of the inner ring and outer rings are aligned with 
each other (illustrated in Fig. 1.4). By doing so, 
speciﬁed clearance and preload for DF, DB, and 
DT sets are ensured, but it is only possible if the 
combined bearings have the same clearance/
preload symbols.

Fig.1.4 Flush grinding
If these combined bearings are used as part of 
multiple combined bearings, it is recommended 
that the variation of bore and outer diameter 
tolerance is within 1/3 of tolerance range. 
TPI bearings with special accuracy P4X can 
accommodate small variations of bore and outer 
diameter tolerance. P4X bearings have the same 
running accuracy as P4 while has a narrower 
tolerance range. It is suitable for random matching 
on universal combination bearings. It also brings 
convenience for customers to optimize their 
inventory with more precision P4X bearings.
Universal matching plays an important role in 
controlling the dimensional differences in the bore 
and outside diameters between duplex bearings. 
When ordering bearings from TPI, please 
specify the desired number of duplex bearings 
to be used ("D2" for DB, DF or DT; "D3" for 
DBT, DFT or DTT). Simply indicate the basic 
combination and specify universal matching. 
For speciﬁc needs of bore and outside diameter 
of bearings, please contact TPI for customized 
tolerance.
1.2.4 Special P4X Accuracy 
P4X bearings can control the bearing-to-bearing 
difference in the bore and outside diameters to 
no more than one third the tolerance (a minimum 
of 2 μm) as shown in Table 1.2. Their bearing 
code normally comes with ﬂushed grinding and 
universal matching as follows:

1.2.5 Double-row cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearing is able to support 
larger radial load than point-contact ball bearing, 
since the rollers and raceways are in linear 
contact. Its structure is also suitable for high-
speed operation.
TPI's double-row cylindrical roller bearings are 
available in two types: NN and NNU, and two 
series: 30 and 49. The rollers in the NN type are 
guided by the ribs of inner ring; whereas the rollers 
in the NNU type are guided by the ribs of the outer 
ring. Tapered bore type (allows adjustment of 
radial internal clearance of bearing) or a standard 
cylindrical bore are available for selection. In 
addition, TPI offers the standard type and high-
speed type to satisfy our customer's demands. 
For standard type, a set of machined brass cages 
are used while high temperature special molded 
resin cages for high-speed applications. They 
can be used for both grease lubrication and air-oil 
lubrication.
1.2.6 Angular Contact Thrust Ball Bearings
A range of thrust bearings used in machine 
tools for the main spindles. They includes 5629 
and 5620 series for high axial rigidity (contact 
angle 60° ) and HTA series high-speed duplex 
angular contact ball bearings for axial loads with 
optimized internal design (contact angle 40°, 
30°). These bearings are used in conjunction 
with NN30, NN49, or NNU49 series double-row 
cylindrical roller bearings (matched bearings must 
have the same bore and outside diameter).

---

5
  These duplex angular contact ball bearing 
series have similar design to the double-row 
thrust angular contact ball bearing series, but are 
different in terms of their width. Since their contact 
angles are lower at 40° and 30°, the series boast 
high speed capability. However, their axial rigidity 
is less than double-row thrust angular contact ball 
bearings with 60° contact angle.
1.3 Ball Screw Support Bearings
Ball Screw Support (BS) Bearings have the 
maximum possible number of small balls and 
thicker inner & outer rings, with the contact angle 
at 60°. This design allows greater axial rigidity. 
Since balls are used instead of rollers as rolling 
elements, starting torque is thus less than roller 
bearings.
Flushing grinding technique is used to 
ensure that the face height differences of BS 
type bearings are the same on both sides. This 
advantage allows the users to freely combine 
bearings with the same part numbers into DB, 
DBT, DTBT arrangements, and there is no need 
to adjust relevant preload anymore. It is also 
available for special request on bearing material, 
grease, sealing and so on. Please contact TPI for 
further information.
  The BS type is mainly installed on ball screws 
of machine tool feed systems, and two to four 
rows arrangements are used in many cases. Both 
back-to-back and face-to-face duplex arrangement 
are used in this application. The face-to-face 
duplex arrangement may be used if misalignment 
is un-avoidable as shown in Fig.1.5.

3 Bearing Tolerance and Fits
3.1 Bearing Tolerance
Bearing “tolerances” or dimensional accuracy and running accuracy are regulated by ISO 492:2002 and 
JIS B 1514 standards (rolling bearing tolerances) shown in Table 3.1. 
When mounting a bearing to a shaft or housing, the dimensional accuracy is crucial in satisfying the 
tolerance. A permissible run-out occurring when rotating a bearing by one revolution is deﬁned by the running 
accuracy. Appendix III shows bearing accuracy for angular contact ball bearings, BS series bearings, and 
cylindrical roller bearings. Methods for measuring the accuracy of rolling bearings are described in JIS B 
1515 and in Table 3.2.

A super-precision bearing that conforms to 
the user's main spindle speciﬁcations must be 
chosen in order to attain a higher level of running 
accuracy required of a main spindle of machine 
tool. A super-precision bearing of JIS accuracy 
class 5, 4, or 2 is usually selected according 
to its application. The main spindle's running 
accuracy needs to be strictly controlled because it 
is affected by the radial run-out, axial run-out and 
non-repetitive run-out of the main spindle bearing. 
The super precision machine tools requires ﬁnely 
controlled N.R.R.O. (Non-Repetitive Run-out), 
therefore the main spindle on a turning machine or 
machining center often utilizes N.R.R.O. accuracy 
controlled bearings. 
  TPI's cylindrical roller bearings comply with JIS 
Classes 4 and 2 speciﬁcations, as shown in Table 
3.3. Poor accuracies of the tapered bore may 
lead to misalignment of the inner ring, causing 
poor performance of the bearing; in severe cases, 
premature seizure and ﬂaking may occur. Using a 
taper gauge is recommended for achieving higher 
accuracy on the main spindle. Please refer to "8. 
Bearing Handling: 8.6 Clearance adjustment for 
cylindrical roller bearing" for more information on 
taper angle.

3.2 N.R.R.O. (Non-Repetitive Run-Out) 
of bearing
Accuracies of rolling bearings are deﬁned 
by ISO and JIS standards. Table 3.2 shows the 
methods for measuring running accuracies. A 
rotating bearing in a machine tool operates in a 
continuous revolving motion that involves more 
than once revolution. As shown in Fig.3.1, the 
actual run-out accuracy with a rotating bearing 
includes elements that are not synchronous 
with the revolution of a bearing, as a result, the 
trajectory of plotting with running accuracies vary 
with each revolution.
The run-out of an element not in 
synchronization with the revolutions of bearing 
may be caused by form accuracy of raceways, 
dimension tolerance of rolling elements, and 
N.R.R.O. accuracy of cage under high-speed 
condition etc. Improvement in spindle form 
accuracy could lead to higher precision work 
piece and better tolerance and surface roughness 
of mold tooling.
Fig.3.1 Illustration of non-repetitive run-out  
3.3 Accuracies of Shaft and Housing
The bearing's internal clearance may vary, 
depending on the ﬁt of a bearing to a shaft and 
a housing. It is important to make sure that an 
adequate bearing ﬁt is attained to achieve desired 
bearing performance. Table 3.4 and 3.5 show the 
accuracies of shaft and housing.
  The axial tightening torque on a bearing 
should be carefully considered, because too 
much axial tightening may cause deformation of 
the bearing raceway surface. Please take time to 
carefully determine the dimensions of components 
associated with a tightening force, the magnitude 
of tightening force, and the number of tightening 
bolts.
  When designing a bearing and housing, in 
order to maintain bearing and housing accuracies 
and also to avoid interference with the bearing 
related corner radius, it is important to provide 
a sufﬁcient shoulder height for the bearing and 
housing. Table 3.6 shows the chamfer dimensions 
and the recommended shoulder height. Table 3.7 
lists the corner radius on the shaft and housing.
Relief dimensions for ground shaft and housing 
ﬁtting surfaces are given in Table 3.8.

Precision Rolling Bearings
3.4 Shaft and Housing ﬁts
The performance of bearings such as speed 
capability and running accuracy is inﬂuenced 
by the seats and the precision of the selected 
ﬁts of shaft and housing.  Recommended ﬁts for 
general operating conditions at inner ring rotation 
of precision bearings used for machine tools are 
shown in Tables 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11. If the dmN 
value (dmN: pitch circle diameter across rolling 
elements [mm] multiplied by speed [min-1]) is 
higher than the value of one million, one should 
consider the expansion of inner ring caused by 
centrifugal force. It also inﬂuences preload in 
bearings. In this case, more detailed analysis is 
needed from some simulation tools such as TH-
BBAN software for determining bearing ﬁt and 
possibly increasing interference ﬁt to compensate 
the centrifugal effect.
For high speed thrust angular contact ball 
bearing, or so-called biaxial thrust BT angular 
contact ball bearing, ﬁts also given in Tables 
3.9,3.10 are recommended. Since a paired of 
angular contact ball bearing is normally used 
with a cylindrical roller bearing, the requirement 
of accuracies of shaft and housing needs to be 
considered the same as a cylindrical roller bearing 
is used. For a cylindrical roller bearing with taper 
bore, when mounting a tapered bore bearing onto 
a shaft, it should make good contact with its seat 
to maintain high precision of the bearing.
For ball screw support bearings (BS series 
type) recommended ﬁt of shaft and housing are h5 
and H6 respectively. The tolerances of shoulder 
squareness is within 4 μm for diameter less than 
80 mm.

4 Bearing Load Rating and Life
Even under normal conditions, the surfaces 
of the raceway and rolling elements of a bearing 
are subjected to repeated compressive stresses, 
which will eventually cause ﬂaking of these 
surfaces to occur. Flaking is a sign of material 
fatigue, which may eventually lead to bearing 
failure. A bearing's effective life is usually deﬁned 
by the total number of revolutions the bearing 
can undergo before ﬂaking on either the raceway 
surface or rolling element surfaces occur.
Others causes of bearing failure may include 
seizing, abrasions, cracking, chipping, gnawing, 
rust, etc. These "causes" are often related to 
improper installation, insufﬁcient or improper 
lubrication, faulty sealing or inaccurate bearing 
matching or selection. In another word, man-
caused bearing failure can be avoided by taking 
precautions, and they should be separately 
considered from the ﬂaking aspect that is related 
to material fatigue.
In most cases, the load exerted on the main 
spindle of a machine tool is relatively small 
compared to the dynamic load on the bearing. 
Therefore, the fatigue life of a bearing seldom 
poses a problem. Rather, bearing size is almost 
determined by other factors such as system 
rigidity or ﬁxed dimensions of the spindle as 
well as the speed and feed parameters of the 
application.
4.1 Basic Rating Life and Basic 
Dynamic Load Rating 
The general information about bearing life 
calculation and basic load ratings is also valid for 
high precision bearings. It should be noted that all 
life calculations are based on ISO 281:2007. 
The basic rating life for a radial ball bearing is 
given by the life equation:
where，
L10	: basic rating life at 90% reliability, millions 
of revolutions
p	 : exponent of the life equation

: 3 for ball bearings

: 10/3 for roller bearings
Cr	 : Basic dynamic load rating, N or kgf   
P : The equivalent dynamic load　N or kgf
The basic dynamic load rating Cr is also 
deﬁned in ISO 281:2007. It expresses the bearing 
load that will provide a basic life on one million 
revolutions. It is assumed that the load is constant 
in magnitude and direction and is radial for radial 
bearings or axial for thrust bearings.
To calculate bearing life with basic dynamic 
load ratings, it is necessary to convert the actual 
dynamic loads into an equivalent dynamic 
bearings load. The equivalent dynamic bearing 
load P is deﬁned as a hypothetical load, constant 
in magnitude and direction, acting radially for 
radial bearing or axially for thrust bearings. It is 
used to represent the effect that the actual load 
would have on bearing life. 
The basic dynamic load rating and equivalent 
dynamic bearings load are listed in precision 
being tables for TPI standard bearing materials, 
using standard manufacturing techniques. Please 
consult TPI for basic load ratings of bearings 
constructed of special materials or using special 
manufacturing techniques.
When calculating the basic dynamic radial load 
rating for two similar single-row angular contact 
ball bearings mounted side by side on the same 
shaft, such that they operate as a unit (DB or 
DF arrangement), the pair is considered as one

Precision Rolling Bearings
double-row angular contact ball bearing. For two 
or more similar such bearings mounted side by 
side in a tandem arrangement, the basic dynamic 
radial load rating is the number of bearings to the 
power of 0.7 times the rating of one single-row 
bearing.
4.2 New Bearing Life Formula
As Fig 4.1 shows, based on the earlier work of 
Weibull, Lundberg-Palmgren (L-P) established a 
theory and method to predict the fatigue life of rolling 
bearings. The basic equation of the L-P theory is:
where，
N : the number of stress cycles endured with 
probability of survival S, 
τo : the maximum value of subsurface 
orthogonal shear stress as the failure-
causing stress,
V	 :	 the volume of subsurface material 
subjected to stress, and   
Z0 : the depth at whichτo occurs. 
For many applications, prediction of bearing 
fatigue life using the Lundberg-Palmgren 
theory life modiﬁed by serial mulplication of life 
adjustment factors is substantially inaccurate. 
This is especially true for bearings in applications 
involving relatively light loads; e.g., applications in 
which the maximum Hertz stress is less than 1400 
MPa (approximately 200 kpsi). 
The Ioannides-Harris (I-H) theory, an extension 
of the Lundberg-Palmgren theory, introduced the 
concept of a fatigue limit stress. Under the same 
Weibull weakest link theory, the probability of 
survival ∆Si of a volume ∆Vi , sufﬁciently large to 
contain many defects, can be generally expressed 
as:
A major feature of the Ioannides-Harris theory 
is that it compares the total stress at any point 
in the rolling component to the fatigue limit. The 
total stress at each point is calculated using the 
Von Mises stress. The life of each ball-raceway 
contact is determined by numerical integration of 
the ﬁeld of Von Mises stresses. Bearing fatigue 
life is determined by statistical combination of the 
rolling component lives. If this value is equal to 
or less than 0, then the elemental volume will not 
experience fatigue. Fig. 4.2 illustrates schematically 
the load-life relationship between L-P and I-H 
theories. Fig. 4.3 shows the stress volume resulting 
from rolling contact according to I-H theory.    
Fig. 4.1 Stress volume resulting from rolling 
contact according to L-P theory
Fig. 4.2 Load-life comparison between L-P and 
I-H theories
Fig. 4.3 Stress volume resulting from rolling 
contact according to I-H theory
Lundberg-Palmgren states that the volume 
under stress is proportional to the volume of the 
cylindrical ring. This proportionality is only valid 
when simple Hertz contact is applied to a smooth 
surface. The L-P theory also does not account for 
the effect of temperature on lubrication and hence 
on shear stresses. A number of shortcomings of 
the L-P theory became apparent in the decades. 
The stress-life method based on I-H theory for 
prediction of bearing fatigue life considers the 
integrated effect of all stresses acting on the rolling 
component surfaces together with those stresses 
within the component. The latter stresses may 
be caused by ring rotation, mounting of the inner 
ring on the shaft or the outer ring in the housing, 
heat treatment of the component, or surface 
forming and ﬁnishing processes. In addition to 

---

17
the Hertz stresses, which tend to be the stresses 
of greatest inﬂuence on bearing fatigue life, 
stresses are caused by shearing of the lubricant 
in the contacts and friction between asperities on 
mating surfaces when lubricant ﬁlm thickness is 
insufﬁcient to completely separate the surfaces. 
Moreover, dents in the rolling surfaces caused 
by hard particle contamination result in stress 
concentrations, which augment both the Hertz and 
surface shear stresses. This was accomplished 
using the analytical TH-BBAN computer program 
developed by the concept of a stress-life to fulﬁll 
the requirement for the interdependency of the 
various fatigue life-inﬂuencing factors. TH-BBAN 
calculates fatigue life of each ball-raceway contact 
is accomplished by evaluation of a life integral 
according to the total or actual stress condition 
compared to the life integral corresponding to the 
simple Hertz stress application shown as follows:
Where
ASL is called the contact stress-life factor in TH-
BBAN. As an alternative to the life formula, ISO 
281:2007 established the bearing life equation 
format as follows:
          Ln M=A1 AISO L10
Ln M : the basic rating life modiﬁed for a reliability 
(100-n)% 
A1  : the reliability-life factor
AISO	 : the integrated life factor, including material, 
lubrication and contamination effects (ISO 
4406 cleanliness code adopted)
4.3 Static Load Rating and Allowable 
Axial Load  
In practice, permanent deformations of small 
magnitude occur even under light loads. If the 
deformations become much larger, the cavities 
formed in the raceways cause the bearing to 
vibrate and become nosier. Moreover, indentations 
together with conditions of marginal lubrication 
can lead to surface-initiated fatigue. 
Experience has shown that permanent 
deformations have little effect on the operation of 
the bearing if the magnitude at any given contact 
point is limited to a maximum of 0.0001 times the 
diameter of the rolling element.
The basic static load rating of a rolling bearing 
is deﬁned as that load applied to a non-rotating 
bearing that will result in permanent deformation of 
0.0001 times the diameter of the rolling element at 
the weaker of the inner or outer raceway contacts 
occurring at the position of the maximum loaded 
rolling element. For ball bearings, the maximum 
applied load value for contact stress occurring at 
the rolling element and raceway contact points are 
4200MPa or 428kgf/mm
2.
A sufﬁcient safety factor to protect the bearing 
from permanent deformation can be obtained when
         Po 
where,
Po : equivalent static bearing load, N or kgf
Co : basic static load rating, N or kgf
So : static safety factor
The basic static load rating Co is deﬁned in ISO 
76:2006. It corresponds to a calculated contact 
stress at the center of the most heavily loaded 
rolling element/raceway contact that produces 
a permanent deformation of the rolling element 
diameter. The loads are purely radial for radial 
bearings and axial for thrust bearings. The basic 
static load rating Co is listed in the bearing tables. 
To compare actual loads with the basic static 
load rating, the actual loads must be converted 
into an equivalent load. This is deﬁned as that 
hypothetical load which, if applied would cause the 
same maximum rolling element load in the bearing 
as the loads to which the bearing is subjected.
4.4 Bearing Life for High Speed 
Application   
For high-speed applications, the effects of ball 
centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments need 
to be included. The force and moment equilibrium 
equations for the bearing inner ring are solved for 
the bearing axial, radial, and angular deﬂections. 
If the bearing has a complement of Z balls, then 
a system of 4Z+5 equations is solved numerically 
using the Newton-Raphson method.
For the analysis including the determination of 
ball friction forces and speeds, in addition to the 
5 force and moment load equilibrium equations 
for the inner ring, the torques acting on the cage 
in the plane of bearing rotation are balanced, 
and cage speed is determined. In this case a 
system of 9Z+6 equations are solved numerically. 
TPI’s HS high-speed type angular contact ball 
bearings are optimally designed with their internal 
conﬁguration to accommodate both low frictional 
heat or ball skidding effect and high rigidity by 
using TH-BBAN.

4.5 Life for Hybrid Bearings
When calculating the rating life for hybrid 
bearings, the same life values can be used as 
for all-steel bearings. The ceramic balls in hybrid 
bearings are much harder and stiffer than the all-
steel bearings. Although this increased level of 
hardness and stiffness creates a higher degree of 
contact stress between the ceramic ball and the 
steel raceway, extensive experience and testing 
shows that in typical machine tool applications, 
the service life of hybrid bearing is signiﬁcantly 
longer than that of all-steel bearing. The reasons 
for this are: 1) low density minimizes centrifugal 
and inertial forces; 2) low surface adhesive wear is 
reduced by the lower afﬁnity to steel; and 3) better 
surface ﬁnish enables the bearing to maximize the 
effects of the lubricant.

5 Bearing Preload and Rigidity
5.1 Rigidity of spindle
System rigidity in machine tool applications 
is extremely important because the magnitude 
of deﬂection under load determines machining 
accuracy. Bearing rigidity is only one factor that 
inﬂuences system rigidity; others include shaft 
diameter, tool overhang, housing rigidity number, 
position and type of bearings. For axial rigidity 
of spindles, bearing rigidity plays an important 
role of it. Giving preload to a bearing result in 
the rolling element and raceway surfaces being 
under constant elastic compressive forces at their 
contact points. This has the effect of making the 
bearing extremely rigid so that even when load 
is applied to the bearing, radial or axial shaft 
displacement does not occur.
If high radial rigidity of bearing is needed, 
cylindrical roller bearings are normally used. 
In contrast to angular contact ball bearing, 
they provide more surface contact and gross 
sliding and are not suitable for very high-speed 
applications. For axial loading applications, 
angular contact ball bearings are normally used. 
Their larger contact angle type provides higher 
axial rigidity. The rigidity of this type also depends 
on number and size of balls. Recently, the ceramic 
material silicon nitride Si3N4 is used for precision 
ball bearings. The radial rigidity of this hybrid 
bearing is approximately 15% higher because of 
the higher Young's modulus. As mentioned in 4.5, 
TPI's HS type angular contact ball bearings are 
optimally designed with their internal conﬁguration 
to accommodate both low-ball skidding effect and 
high rigidity by using TH-BBAN. 

5.2 Bearing Preload
The preload method is divided into ﬁxed 
position preload and constant pressure preload 
as shown in Fig. 5.1. The ﬁxed position preload 
is effective for positioning the two bearings and 
also for increasing the rigidity. Due to the use of 
a spring for the constant pressure preload, the 
preloading amount can be kept constant, even 
when the distance between the two bearings 
ﬂuctuates under the inﬂuence of operating heat 
and load. 
Fig. 5.1 Preloading methods for bearings
Fixed position preload
Constant pressure preload
The increased rigidity effect preloading has on 
bearings is shown in Fig. 5.2. When the offset 
inner rings of the two paired angular contact ball 
bearings are pressed together, each inner ring is 
displaced axially by the amount δa0 and is thus 
given a preload, Fa0, in the direction. Under this 
condition, when external axial load Fa is applied, 
bearing A will have an increased displacement by 
the amountδa0 and bearing B's displacement will 
decrease. At this time the loads applied to bearing 

---

19
A and B are FaA and FaB, respectively. Under 
the condition of no preload, bearing A will be 
displaced by the amount δaoA when axial load Fa 
is applied. Since the amount of displacement, δa, 
is less than δaoA, it indicates a higher rigidity for 
δa. When external axial load Fa keeps increasing 
untilδaA equals to 2δaoA, that is, δaB=0. Now, 
bearing B becomes released from preload while 
bearing A is loaded with 2.83 times of given 
preload Fa0. This amount of load is called the 
limiting axial load and it may depend on bearing 
arrangement and contact angle.

displacement
5.2.1 Bearing standard preload
Universal combination bearings 
and matched bearing sets are 
produced in four different standard 
preload to meet the varying 
requirements including rotational 
speed, rigidity and heat generation. 
It is also needed to be aware that the 
proper preload during high-speed 
operation is important. Fig. 5.3 shows 
the factors may lead to preload 
change after installation and during 
operation. Among those factors, TPI 
may provide face side offset increase 
due to interference ﬁt between inner and shaft. 
Please contact TPI for further information. 
There are four standard preloads: L (Light 
preload), N (Normal preload), M (Medium 
preload), and H (Heavy preload). These 
preload from light to heavy have certain ratio 
of dynamic basic load rating Cr. Table 5.1 is 
the preload comparison table of TPI bearings 
with other brand bearings for 7014C angular 
contact ball bearings. It is noted that preload 
setting methods may be different for other 
brand bearings. Table 5.9 shows standard 
preload, rigidity, and measured face side offset 
in DB and DF arrangement of various series of 
angular contact ball bearings. To stabilize the 
measurement of face side offset, measuring 
load is usually axially applied and listed in Table 
5.2. As shown in Fig. 5.2, the true face side 
offset is -2δaoA, while the measured face side 
offset in DB and DF arrangement as shown in 
Table 5.9 is compensated with measuring load. 
The positive and negative signs are deﬁned in 
Appendix IV. 
  Table 5.10 shows standard preload and rigidity 
in DB and DF arrangement of BT and BS series of 
angular contact ball bearings.

5.2.2 Individual adjustment of preload  
In case where universal combination bearings 
or matched bearing sets are used, preload is 
determined at the factory during production. In 
some cases, however, it may be necessary to 
optimize the preload to accommodate operating 
conditions. It is possible to increase or decrease 
preload by using spacer rings between the 
bearings. For instance, in DB arrangement, 
reduce width of outer spacer rings should 
decrease preload while reduce width of inner 
rings should increase preload. In DF arrangement, 
reduce width of outer spacer rings should 
increase preload while reduce width of inner rings 
should decrease preload as shown in Fig. 5.4. By 
grinding the side face of the inner or outer spacer 
the preload in the bearing set can be changed. In 
these cases, the bearings should not be modiﬁed, 
as this requires special tools, and the bearings 
could be damaged. Table 5.3 provides information 
about which of the equal-width spacer ring side 
faces must be ground and what effect it will have. 
Table 5.9 contains the necessary dimensional 
deviation for the overall width of the spacer rings 
from deviation of measured face side offsets 
between two different standard preloads (positive 
value).

In the case of DT arrangement, it is necessary 
to remember that axial deﬂectionδa of the 
combination bearings under preload is less that 
of in DB and DF arrangement. Therefore, this 
difference has to be considered to the value of 
width reduction of spacer for altering preload as 
shown in Table 5.4.

However, it is not necessary to determine 
axial deﬂection although it can be calculated 
once bearing arrangement and contact angle 
(including mixed contact angle) are designated 
for applications. As long as the bearing preload 
provides sufﬁcient system rigidity, the resulting 
preload can be determined by a factor for its 
bearing arrangement as shown in Table 5.5. The 
value of resulting preload Pr is

5.3 Rigidity of angular contact ball 
bearing
Elastic deformation in rolling bearings results 
in the rings being displaced relative to each 
other. For angular contact ball bearings, the 
following formula is used to calculate this relative 
displacement in a radial and axial direction: 
where，δr :radial displacement under pure 
radial load, mm

---

21
δa : axial displacement under pure axial load, 
mm
Fr : pure radial load, kgf
Fa : pure axial load, kgf
  i : No. of row
 Z : No. of balls per row
Dw : ball pitch diameter, mm
 α	: contact angle, degrees
In Table 5.9, the (axial) rigidity is deﬁned as 
the external axial load of a bearing set in DB or 
DF arrangement, which causes a deﬂection of 1 
micron of the bearing rings to each other. Before 
reaching to limiting axial load, bearing rigidity can 
is consistently measured and the result is close 
to the calculated value under light and normal 
preload. However, for bearings under medium 
and heavy preload, the calculated value becomes 
doubtable because change of initial and ﬁnal 
contact angles. The above formula for radial and 
axial displacements is not valid under heavy 
load and need more rigorous analytical computer 
program such as TH-BBAN program to solve it.
Radial rigidity varies with contact angle and 
preload. In contrast to the axial rigidity, radial 
rigidity decreases as contact angle increases 
and changes markedly as a function of the ratio 
between axial and external loads applied to the 
bearing. In practical manner, the radial and axial 
rigidity are determined as follows. Rigidity factors 
with various arrangements, contact angle, and 
preload in the formula can be obtained in Table 5.6 
and 5.7.
Rr = q1 • q2 • Ra          N/μm
Ra = q1 • Rao
where, q1 : rigidity factor for bearing arrangement,  
                  please refer to Table 5.6
             q2 : rigidity factor for contact angle and

5.4 Limiting Axial Load
Limiting axial load is the external axial load of 
a preloaded bearing pair or set that causes loss 
of contact between the balls and race in preload 
bearings. This effect may lead to balls skidding 
against the raceways and surface damage.
In some machine tools applications, where 
the working axial load is predominantly in one 
direction, limiting axial load can be increased by 
using a bearing set with a mixed contact angle. 
The axially more rigid bearing withstands the 
workload and the less rigid one is the reaction 
element. Table 5.8 is an example to address the 
above concept. Compared to the bearing set with 
same contact angle, the bearing set with a mixed 
contact angle of 15 and 25 degrees withstands 
higher 5.9 times of axial preload load (compared 
to 2.83 times of preload). Furthermore, it could be 
considered that increasing their contact angle by 
3~5 degree, bearings withstand their axial load 
may have 16 ~32% more limiting axial load and 
axial rigidity as well.

6 Bearing Lubrication
The purpose of bearing lubrication is to prevent 
direct metal-to-metal contact between the various 
rolling and sliding elements. This is accomplished 
through the formation of a thin oil (or grease) ﬁlm 
on contact surfaces. Lubrication also helps to 
reduce friction and wear, dissipate friction heat, 
keep away from dust. In order to achieve the 
above advantages and prolong the bearing life, 
the most effective lubrication method and lubricant 
has to be selected for each individual operating 
condition.
The machine tool spindle keeps the amount 
of lubricant at minimal and no more than that 
required to ensure lubricating to avoid heat 
generation. The relationship between oil quantity, 
heat generation, and bearing temperature rise is 
summarized in Fig.6.1.
There are several lubrication methods such 
as grease lubrication, oil mist lubrication, air-
oil lubrication, and jet lubrication for bearings 
in a machine tool include. Each method has its 
advantages and disadvantages. It is aware that 
grease lubrication is being used increasingly not 
only because it is simple and inexpensive but also 
because it is environmental friendly.
Fig. 6.1 Oil quantity, heat generation, and 
temperature rise
6.1 Grease Lubrication and Its Life 
Prediction
Lubricating grease is composed of either a 
mineral oil base or a synthetic oil base. To this 
base a thickener and other additives are added. 
Thickening agents are compounded with base oils 
to maintain the semi-solid state of the grease.
When lubricating bearings in high-speed 
machine tool spindle, the amount of grease 
supplied should be no more than that required to 
ensure lubricating, if the temperature is to be kept 
as low as possible. The following guideline for 
the amount of grease used for spindles is given 
below.
．Angular contact ball bearing: 20~25% of 
bearing free space. The higher speed or dmn 
value, the less the grease amount ﬁlled. Please 
consult TPI.
．Deep groove ball bearing bearing:30% of 
bearing free space
The free space in a bearing typically used 
for main spindles are listed in dimension tables. 
One may determine the amount of grease ﬁlled 
accordingly. 
For ball screw support applications, support 
bearings are generally lubricated by grease. The 
recommended grease is listed in Table 6.1 and 
amount of grease is 25% of bearing free space.

6.2 Air-oil Lubrication
Air-oil lubrication provides speciﬁc as well as 
volume-regulated lubricant delivery to the rolling 
and sliding surfaces in the bearing. The oil is 
transported by means of an air stream that form 
streaks along the inner wall of the transparent 
supply hose and released uniformly at lubricating 
points at speciﬁed intervals.  Air-oil lubrication 
provides utmost effectiveness with respect to 
consumption and lubricating effect at maximum 
speeds.
The oil nozzles should be positioned correctly. 
A nozzle with a hole diameter of 1.0 to 1.5 mm 
and a length 4 to 6 times the hole diameter 
is recommended. Air-oil lubrication requires 
a specialized nozzle because it supplies the 
lubricating oil to the inside of the bearing by 
means of compressed air. Fig. 6.2 illustrates the 
feed system for air-oil lubrication when lubricant 
is supplied between the cage and inner ring. 
Table 6.4 shows the Air-oil/oil mist nozzle spacer 
dimension.

6.3 Jet Lubrication
Oil jet is preferred for bearings having to 
operate at very high speed and high load. This 
is the most reliable lubricating technique and is 
typically used on the main spindle bearings of jet 
engines and gas turbines. 
When used as a lubricating system for the 
main spindle of a machine tool, the amount of 
oil crossing the bearings also removes the heat 
generated by bearing operation and maintains 
overall temperature at acceptable levels. 
However, the resultant torque loss is great, as a 
large amount of oil which is low viscosity oil (ISO 
standards VG10 or VG15) is supplied to each 
bearing.
7 Bearing Limiting Speed
7.1 Bearing Limiting Speed
Angular contact ball bearings feature the 
highest rotational speed capabilities of all 
precision bearings. The limiting speeds listed in 
the precision bearing tables are guideline values. 
They are based on a single bearing that is lightly 
spring preloaded and subject to both grease and 
air-oil lubrication. In situations where the lubricant 
is used as a mean to remove heat, higher 
speed can be achieved. Limiting temperature 
for grease-lubricated bearings is lower than that 
for oil because of greater lubricant deterioration. 
Therefore, limiting speed for grease lubrication is 
consequently about 75% of the value achievable 
with oil.
Achievement of maximum speed is affected 
by internal conﬁguration and correct assembly of 
the bearings. For bearing internal conﬁguration, 
bearing arrangement, preload, bearing precision, 
contact angle and way of lubrication may inﬂuence 
bearing speed. Also, tolerance limits of shaft, 
housing, and spindle components, proper dynamic 
balancing of rotating parts, and efﬁcient lubrication 
are external.

---

Accordingly, the limiting speed calculation can 
be performed based on the above consideration 
and the speed nmax is calculated as follows:
nmax  = f1  •  f2  •  f3  •  nL  min
-1

where， f1  : Speed factor for bearing 
arrangement v.s. preload, refer to 
Fig. 7.1
 f2   : Speed factor for bearing precision, 
refer to Table 7.1
 f3  : Speed factor for contact angle, refer 
to Table 7.2

oil lubrications, refer to Precision

When a ceramic ball is used, limiting speed 
value will be 1.25 times the value of steel ball. If 
the ball guided polyamide resin cage is used, the 
limiting speed is limited to 1.4 million dmN values.
The limiting speed for ball screw support 
BS thrust bearings is different from that for 
angular contact ball bearings. It accounts for 
the discrepancy for contact angle and preload 
between two types of bearings. The speed factor 
of limiting speed nmax for BS bearings are listed in

7.2 Friction
One of the main functions required of a bearing 
is that it must have low friction. Under normal 
operating conditions rolling bearings have a much 
smaller friction coefﬁcient than the slide bearings, 
especially starting friction.
The friction coefﬁcient for rolling bearings 
is calculated on the basis of the bearing bore 
diameters and is expressed by formula
where，
M：Friction moment, N．mm or kgf．mm
μ ：Friction coefﬁcient, N．mm
P ：Load, N or kgf
d ：Bearing bore diameter, mm
 Although the dynamic friction coefﬁcient for 
rolling
bearings varies with the type of bearings, load,
lubrication, speed, and other factors; for normal 
operating conditions, the approximate friction 
coefﬁcients for various bearing types are listed in 
Table 7.6.

8 Bearing Handling
8.1 Cleaning and ﬁlling with grease
Handling the precision rolling bearing correctly 
is a vital step to achieve maximum speed and 
limited temperature rise. The handling of bearings 
involves cleaning, drying, ﬁlling with grease (if 
necessary), and the running-in operation.
For each step, please take precaution and 
follow the below description:
The cleaning step removes the rust-preventive 
oil. First, immerse the bearing in kerosene or a 
highly volatile solvent such as naphthesol. Wash 
the bearing carefully by hand and then remove 
the kerosene using benzene or alcohol. Use 
clean compressed air to blow away the rinsing 
ﬂuid. (After cleaning, coating the bearing with the 
lubricant to be used or less viscous oil for jet-oil 
lubrication, or immersing the bearing in lubricant 
or other low-viscosity oil is recommended.)
If the bearing is to be used with grease 
lubrication, the bearing should be dried thoroughly 
to avoid leakage of grease. Fill the bearing with 
grease immediately after drying. Drying can be 
achieved by blowing hot air onto the bearing or 
placing the bearing in a chamber at constant 
temperature. When drying with hot air, please 
make sure the air is clean.
For greasing ball and roller bearings please 
refer to the procedure shown below. For ball 
bearings, use an injector or small plastic bag, 
aiming at the inner ring rolling surface, and 
carefully apply grease between balls in equal 
amounts. For bearings with ring-guided cage, 
also apply grease to the guide surface of the cage 
using a spatula or similar tool. If grease cannot be 
added into the inner ring raceway due to the small 
gap between the cage and the inner ring, add 
grease to the outer ring raceway. In this case, turn 
the bearing so that the grease is fully spread on 
the inner ring side. 
For roller bearings, apply grease to the outer 
or inner side of rollers, while turning the rollers to 
spread the grease to the opposite side. If a lump 
of grease remains on the outer face of cage rib, 
the running-in operation may take a longer time
8.2 Running In
For oil lubrication, the running-in operation 
is relatively simple with oil lubrication because 
no peak temperature occurs and the bearing 
temperature stabilizes within a relatively short 
time. TPI recommends that the speed of bearing 
is to be increased in steps of 2000 to 3000 min-
1 until the maximum speed is reached. Every 
speed setting should be maintained for about 30 
minutes. However, for the speed range where the 
dmN (pitch circle diameter across rolling elements 
multiplied by speed) exceeds 1,000,000, increase 
the bearing speed in steps of 1000 to 2000 min-1 
to ensure the stable running.
For a grease-lubricated bearing, a running-
in operation is very important in attaining stable 
temperature rise. During a running-in operation, 
a large temperature rise (peak) occurs while 
the bearing speed is increased, and then the 
bearing temperature eventually stabilizes. Before 
temperature stabilization, a certain lead-time will 
be needed. For ball bearing, TPI recommends 
that the bearing speed be increased in steps of 
1000 to 2000 min-1 and be further increased only 
after the temperature has stabilized at the current 
speed setting. However, for the speed range 
where the dmN exceeds 400,000, increase the 
bearing speed in steps of 500 to 1000 min-1 to 
ensure the stable running. Compared with contact 
ball bearings, the time to peak temperature 
or saturation in running-in operation of roller 
bearings tends to be longer. Also, there will be 
temperature rise due to whipping of the grease 
and the temperature rise may be unstable. To 
cope with this problem, run the roller bearing in 
the maximum speed range for a prolonged period.
Increase the bearing speed in steps of 500 to 
1000 min-1 only after the bearing temperature 
has stabilized at the current speed setting. For the 
speed range where the dmN exceeds 300,000, 
increase the bearing speed in steps of 500 min-1 
to ensure safety.

---

31
As shown in Fig.8.1, bearing speed is increased 
gradually in steps. As soon as the temperature 
becomes saturated at each speed setting, the 
speed is increased to the next step. 
Fig. 8.1 The bearing speed is gradually 
increased in steps
8.3 Mounting
There are several mounting techniques such as 
press ﬁtting with hydraulic press, heating bearings 
with heater, and cool-shrinking shaft with liquid 
nitrogen. It is essential to minimize the adverse 
effects caused by mounting and maintain bearing 
accuracy.
If press-ﬁtting a bearing with a hydraulic press 
is chosen, the press-ﬁtting force due to the 
interference between the shaft and inner ring must 
be calculated. Next, using an inner ring press-
ﬁtting jig, the inner ring is correctly press-ﬁtted 
to the shoulder of shaft. Please be careful not to 
exert a force on the outer ring.
For spindle applications, precision bearings 
are tightly ﬁtted with a shaft. Induction heater 
is frequently used to heat the bearing bore and 
mount to the shaft correctly in position and 
instantly before shrinking back the original size. 
According to the thermal expansion coefﬁcient 
12.5×10
-6, it is easy to calculate interference ﬁt 
δ＝12.5×10
-6×φd×ΔT, whereΔT is heating 
temperature minus room temperature andφd 
is inner ring bore diameter. In reality, the low 
temperature shaft tends to lower the bearing 
and causes it to shrink during mounting. It is 
suggested that the heating temperature to be set 
is more than calculated temperature. If a bearing 
has resin cage, the suggested temperature need 
s to be 80°C or less.
When the bearing temperature drops to room 
temperature, the inner ring will shrink axially, and 
there will be a gap between the bearing side face 
and shaft shoulder illustrated in Fig. 8.2. For this 
reason, push the bearing and shaft together with a 
press until the unit returns to normal temperature. 
After cooling, check that the bearing is mounted to 
the shaft correctly.
Fig. 8.2 Cooling after mounting by heating 
bearings
8.4 Tightening of Inner and Outer Ring
In order to mount and secure a bearing to a 
main spindle when it rotates, the inner ring side 
face is usually clamped with a precision bearing 
nut, and the front cover situated on the outer ring 
side face is bolted down. 
Tightening with a precision bearing nut 
(precision locknut) provides a predetermined 
tightening force by controlling the bearing torque 
shown in Fig 8.3. When locking the bearing 
with a precision bearing nut, make sure that the 
squareness between the bearing surface and the 
shaft centerline is 3μm or less so that adequate 
bearing accuracies are maintained.
Fig. 8.3 Tightening with precision bearing nut  
Because the thread face of the precision 
bearing nut, the thread face of the shaft and 
the bearing surface and nut constitute sliding 
surfaces, the correlation between tightening 
torque and tightening force will vary depending 
on the friction coefﬁcient. The nut tightening force 
refer to Table 8.1. Therefore, the nut needs to be 
thoroughly run on the shaft thread in advance to 
ensure smooth and uniform tightening. It is also 
necessary to determine the correlation between 
tightening torque and tightening force by using a 
load washer or force device.

As shown in Fig. 8.4, the gap for front cover 
pressing allowance may vary depending upon 
its bearing bore diameter. The front cover is 
assembled by utilizing bolt holes (6 to 8 positions) 
on its ﬂange. Too much gap on the outer ring or a 
smaller number of fastening bolts may deteriorate 
the roundness of the bearing ring. It is suggested 
by TPI that:
Bearing bore d≤100 mm, the gap is 0.01-0.03mm；
Bearing bore d≥100 mm, the gap is 0.02-0.04mm；

8.5 Starting Torque of BS Bearings
The BS type is mainly installed on ball screws 
of machine tool feed systems, and two to four 
row arrangements are used in many cases. This 
type is popular because greased sealed angular 
contact ball bearings are easy to handle. The 
starting torque can be altered depending on the 
bearing arrangement and preload. Reference 
starting torque values for BS bearings with normal 
preload are shown in Table 8.2.

8.6 Clearance Adjustment for 
Cylindrical Roller Bearing
For high rigidity main spindle applications such 
as an NC turning machine or machining center, 
a cylindrical roller with taper bore is usually used 
at the front side. The radial clearance or preload 
need to be adjusted accurately. The internal 
clearance is adjusted by ﬁtting the tapered bore 
bearing onto the tapered portion of the main 
spindle and driving the bearing in the axial 
direction to expand the inner ring. For adjusting 
the internal clearance, two methods are available: 
a method consisting of clearance measurement 
for each bearing and adjustment with a spacer(s), 
and a method with an internal clearance 
adjustment gage or so-called GB gauge.
8.6.1 Method with clearance measurement and 
adjustment with spacer (s)
(a) Calculation of outer ring shrinkageΔG with 
the formula:
where，∆G :Outer ring shrinkage ,mm
Dh 	 : Housing bore diameter ,mm
D 
: Bearing outer ring outside diameter ,mm
D0 	 : Bearing outer ring bore diameter ,mm
∆ deff  : Interference at ﬁtting area ,mm

---

(b) Mount the bearing inner ring with the cage 
and rollers onto the tapered shaft shown in Fig. 
8.5. Lightly coat the tapered bore with thin oil and 
position the inner ring on the shaft. It should make 
good contact with its seat and check that the 
bearing side face is square to the main spindle 
centerline. Calculate the estimated bearing 
clearance Δ1 after press-ﬁtting the outer ring into 
the housing with the following formula:
where， ∆ 1 	: Internal clearance after mounting ,μm
              ∆ r1 	: Estimated bearing clearance ,μm
Fig.8.5 Measurement of bearing position and 
radial clearance
(c) To adjust the bearing clearance to a 
predetermined target value (δ) after mounting, 
determine the spacer width La  as follows:
where，L1 : Distance between the shaft shoulder 
and inner ring side face mm 
 La	 : Spacer width mm, refer to Fig. 8.6
 K : Coefﬁcient refer to Table 8.3
Fig.8.6 Clearance measurement after insertion 
of spacer

(d) Insert a spacer that satisﬁes the spacer 
width La between the shoulder and inner ring 
determined in the previous step, and tighten the 
inner ring until the spacer does not move. Next, 
move the bearing outer ring up and down by 
hand and measure the internal clearance after 
mounting. Repeat the steps above to gradually 
decrease the spacer width so as to adjust the 
post-mounting bearing clearance to the targeted 
clearance. The spacer width for the ﬁnal targeted 
clearance will be more readily obtained.
8.6.2 Method with internal clearance gage
When exact preload adjustment is critical for 
the application, mounting the cylindrical roller 
bearings with internal can be done with clearance 
adjustment gage. The gauge has a cylindrical 
ring, which has a cutout so that the ring can be 
opened and closed. The bore surface of the ring 
is used as a location for measurement to replace 
the outer ring raceway diameter measured after 
mounting with the bore gage to the mounted 
internal clearance adjustment gage.
The gauge generally has its adjustment screw 
with dial indicator for mounting and dismounting. 
Since it is not the real housing with outer ring in 
position, each gauge has its own correction factor 
and value provided. Be sure to follow the gauge 
instructions for use

Appendix IV：Method of Measuring 
Face Height Difference(Offset) of 
Combined Angular Contact Ball 
Bearings
“Flush grinding” is a ﬁnishing technique in 
which the front and back faces of the inner and 
outer rings are aligned with each other to eliminate 
differences in face height illustrated in Fig. 1.4. 
Furthermore, a negative difference or offset shown 
in the ﬁgure means preload is generated while a 
positive difference or offset means axial clearance 
exists.
Fig.1.4 Flush grinding
In the case of a DB arrangement, consider put 
a bearing on the left hand side of above ﬁgure 
with back side next to back side as shown in Fig. 
5.2. The face height difference or offset is -2δaoA.
In the case of a DB arrangement, place the 
bearing without the inner-ring spacer on the 
cradle as described in the ﬁgure below, then apply 
measuring load to the inner ring. After the bearing 
is sufﬁciently stabilized, set the dial gauge to 
zero. Next, after removing the outer–ring spacer, 
place the bearing with the inner-ring spacer on 
the cradle and apply measuring load in the same 
way as above. The reading of dial gauge this time 
indicates the height difference or offset.
In the case of a DF arrangement, place the 
bearing without the outer-ring spacer on the 
cradle as described in the ﬁgure below, then apply 
measuring load to the outer ring. After the bearing 
is sufﬁciently stabilized, set the dial gauge to 
zero. Next, after removing the inner–ring spacer, 
place the bearing with the outer-ring spacer on 
the cradle and apply measuring load in the same 
way as above. The reading of dial gauge this time 
indicates the height difference or offset.
Table 5.9 lists the measured face height 
difference or offset of a DB or DF arrangement 
determined by this method. Please refer to the 
measuring load of face height or offset to Table 
5.2.
In the case of single row arrangement, to 
measure back side offset, place the bearing on 
the inner-ring spacer. Place special measuring 
tool and apply measuring load to the outer ring 
on the bearing as described in the ﬁgure below, 
then apply measuring load to the inner ring. After 
the bearing is sufﬁciently stabilized, set the dial 
gauge to zero. Next, turn over the special tool on 
the inner ring. The reading of dial gauge this time 
indicates the height difference or offset of back 
side.
To measure faceside offset, place the bearing 
on the outer-ring spacer. Place special measuring 
tool and apply measuring load to the inner ring 
on the bearing as described in the ﬁgure below, 
then apply measuring load to the outer ring. After 
the bearing is sufﬁciently stabilized, set the dial 
gauge to zero. Next, turn over the special tool on 
the outer ring. The reading of dial gauge this time 
indicates the height difference or offset of front 
side.
