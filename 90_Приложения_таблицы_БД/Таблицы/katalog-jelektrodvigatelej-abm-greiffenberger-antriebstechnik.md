Asynchronous Motors
Edition 07/2007
2


The ABM program of 
asynchronous motors comprises
the full range of model sizes from 56 - 160, each available in different standard lengths. ABM motors successfully incorporate numerous developments, such as
application specific motor windings and extruded aluminum motor housings for compact dimensions to name
just two, essential to achieve maximum flexibility in
manufacturing of tailor-made motors.
ABM asynchronous motors are available as IEC 
standard motors, low-energy motors, built-on motors
for gearboxes and transmissions, rotary field magnets,
special-purpose motors and low voltage AC motors
(specifically for use in battery-powered vehicles).

Today, single-speed three-phase AC motors have grown in importance to become 
the industrial drive. Their complete freedom from maintenance, high efficiency and 
very favourable price/performance ratio are just three of their outstanding features. They are versatile in
use and are the standard solution for variable-speed drives, especially when used with frequency inverters.

ABM disk brakes type EFB and ZFB are electro-mechanical safety brakes and stop 
drives quickly and reliably in any operating mode. There can be no compromises 
when it comes to safety, and ABM have been developing and manufacturing brakes for 60 years. 
This experience has resulted in the continuous improvement of brake performance. 
All brake components and functions are perfectly matched to a particular drive.
The main characteristics and benefits for the user include
• Adjustable torque
• Safe braking in the event of a power loss
• Simple manual adjustment
• Unlimited continuous duty
• Asbestos-free brake lining
• High operating frequency
• Long lining life
• Short On and Off times
Typical Applications
• Cranes, hoists
• Handling and conveying systems
• Machine tools 
• Packaging machines
• Textile machinery 
• Warehousing systems
Options
• Manual ventilation in position A, B, C or D 
• High-speed excitation
• Friction plate corrosion-protected

Method of Operation
On ABM EFB disk brakes (single-sided brake) the brake
coil is cast into the end shield on the brake side. An 
aluminium impeller acts as brake lining carrier. 
In de-energized condition a thrust spring supported off the
brake end shield presses an axially moving armature
base plate against a special brake lining on the impeller.
ABM ZFB disk brakes (2 sided brake) are mounted on the
brake side end shield that also acts as one of the brake
pads. 
Alloy brake disks have a special lining on both faces and
lie between end shield and magnet body with armature
base plate. In de-energized condition a number of springs
press the armature base plate against the brake disk and
bring it into contact with the end shield.
Supply Voltages
The standard supply is 230 V AC, 50 Hz when connected
to the rectifier. Other supply voltages upon request. 
The brake's OFF time can be adapted to individual 
applications by AC side or DC side switching, i.e. making
precise rapid braking or delayed soft braking possible.
The operating time can be reduced with a high-speed
excitation rectifier.

7. Electrical  Characteristics
Rated Power
The power ratings given in the lists are the power output according to VDE0530 for 
continuous operation S1; frequency 50 Hz; max. room temperature 40°C; max. site altitude 1000 m above
sea level.
Rated Voltage and Frequency
The standard voltage ratings are 230/400 V or 400/690 V and rated frequency 50 Hz. Voltage fluctuations 
within +/-10% are permitted. Special voltages and special frequencies are available for export, inverter 
operation and use in battery-powered machines.
Two-speed motors, especially those with Dahlander circuits, are designed for one voltage only. They are
supplied for power supply 230 V or 400 V at 50 Hz. Other voltages or frequencies are possible. Motors with
two separate windings can be designed for two voltages in the ratio of 1:1.73. Further details upon 
request.
Outputs for single-phase motors are based on a rated voltage of 230 V, 50 Hz. 
Rated Currents and Efficiencies
Currents and efficiencies given in Table 1 are based on a rated voltage of 400 V / 50 Hz and full-load rating.
If the rated voltage changes the rated current is converted as follows:   J’ = 400 x J / U’
Starting Current and Starting Torque
Starting torques and currents are a multiple of the rated values with direct starting.
Overload Capacity
In accordance with VDE0530 the motors can withstand 2 minutes at 1.5 times rated current at rated-load 
operating temperature without damage to the winding.
Motor Torque
The motor torque output at the shaft in Nm is:    T [Nm] = 9550 x P [kW] / n [r.p.m.]
Temperature Class
ABM electric motors are manufactured using high-grade "Overcoat" enamelled wire and wrapper material in 
conjunction with solvent-free resin impregnation and meet temperature class F. Maximum temperature is
155°C. A line-side circuit-breaker with overtemperature switch provides the motor with reliable 
protection in the event of an overload. For severe operating conditions (e.g. converter mode, very high 
inertia starting and switching operations with more than 100 c/h) we recommend the use of temperature 
sensors PTC thermistors (see Options, Section 9).

The standard version has a straight shaft end. Key ways have been installed prior to rotor balancing. The type
of balancing method is indicated on the rating plate after product number.
H...half key way (standard), F...full key way
Second shaft end and special shafts upon request.
Mechanical Balance Quality
The rotors are dynamically balanced as marked and meet vibration severity grade A (DIN EN 60034-14). 
Motors can be supplied for vibration severity grade B (Reduced) for special quietness requirements.
Standards and Regulations
ABM electric motors conform to all relevant standards and regulations:
Maximum Radial Forces Fr [N]
Values are based on the centre of the
standard output shaft end when operating at 50 Hz.

PTC Thermistors according to DIN 44081
Three thermistors encapsulated in one winding head (1 per phase) offer the most effective protection against 
motor overheating. External controllers can be connected in the motor junction box. Nominal motor operating 
temperature is 155 ºC.
Temperature Sensors
Temperature sensors open an electric circuit when a pre-determined, non-adjustable temperature is reached. 
Temperature sensors complying with VDE 0631 are used:
Type S01
250V; 50 Hz; 1.6 A at cos
= 0.6; 2.5 A at cos   
= 1
Type S06
250V; 50 Hz; 6.3 A at cos
= 0.6; 10 A at cos   
= 1  
Motor current direct-on-line starting (single-phase motors only)
Temperature Measurements with KTY-Sensors
KTY sensors allow measurements of winding temperature for status monitoring. Sensor resistance changes
with the temperature allowing exact measurements over a wide temperature range. Type KTY 84-130 can be 
directly monitored by ABM inverter controllers type LDC CDA/CDB).
Junction Box
Plastic junction boxes are standard. Upon customer request aluminum junction boxes with integrated 
rectifiers can be supplied with brake motors.
Custom Output Shafts
In addition to straight shafts per DIN 748 custom shaft ends for custom applications are available.
Elevated Protection Class
In addition to standard enclosure protection classes per VDE 0530, elevated protection for aggressive 
environments such as damp locations, dairies and high humidity are available.
Coats of Paint
Motor housings and end shields of ABM electric motors are made from corrosion-resistant aluminum. Junction 
boxes and fan shrouds are made from black plastic. Typically, painting is not required. The following standard
coast of paint colors are available (1K acrylic paint): RAL 7031 (Blue grey), RAL 2002 (Vermilion), RAL 5017 
(Traffic Blue), RAL 6011 (Reseda green), RAL 9005 (Jet black) and RAL 9010 (Pure white). 
Other finishes upon request.
Rotary Encoders
• HTL encoder (24 V signal) with 1024 pulses, A and B channel for frequency converter applications.
• Sin - Cos - encoder (1 Vss) with 1024 pulses A, A, B, B, 0, 0 channels for applications with servoconverter.
• Integrated sensor bearings from world known manufacturers
• TTL-encoder (5 V level signal) with 1024 pulses, A, A, B, B; 0, 0 channels for use with positioning 
inverters.
