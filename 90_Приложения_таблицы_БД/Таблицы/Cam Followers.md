CAM FOLLOWER SELECTION
RBC Cam Followers are presented in five groups: Needle
Roller Cam Followers; Caged Roller Followers; RBC Roller®
Long Life Cam Followers; Material Handling Rollers and
Sheaves; and Airframe Track Rollers and Needle Bearings.
RBC also produces a wide range of custom designed cam
followers and track rollers.  Designers and users with unusual application requirements should contact RBC to 
discuss custom designed cam followers. 
Savings at Every Turn!
RBC Bearings produces the most innovative line of cam
followers in the industry.  The entire line is made from
bearing quality steel for optimum performance.  From the
patented, long-life, RBC Roller® Cam Follower to the 
inventory reducing HexLube® line, RBC achieves cost
savings and provides features that are unmatched by 
competitors.  If you have a special application that is not
served by the exhaustive list of products shown in this 
catalog, RBC has the engineering resources to create 
custom designed cam followers that will meet your needs.
RBC Roller®
The patented RBC Roller® is the leading cost-saver in
the industry.  This long-life cam follower lasts up to 400%
longer than standard cam followers, with no maintenance!
You can calculate your savings at our interactive website
www.rbcbearings.com.
The RBC Roller® is dimensionally interchangeable with
needle roller cam followers.  The RBC Roller® is a good
selection for production machinery applications where
down time is critical and must be avoided, or where cam
followers are not readily accessible for relubrication or
replacement.  They are available in stud type (page 8) and
yoke type (page 10) configurations.
Two paths of end-guided, cylindrical rollers provide
substantial increases in fatigue life and limiting speed.
They can tolerate higher thrust loads than needle roller 
cam followers.  Standard contacting lip seals offer enhanced protection against contaminants and positive 
grease retention.  A large internal grease cavity assures
maintenance-free service.  Hex sockets are a standard 
feature.  Crowned outer rings are available as an option.
HexLube®
RBC’s new Universal HexLube® line of cam followers
can reduce your inventory by about 50%! This innovative
line can eliminate the need for you to stock screwdriver slot
or unsealed cam followers.  Find out how much your 
inventory can be reduced at www.rbcbearings.com. 
The new HexLube® feature allows hex head cam 
followers to be relubricated through the hex head – a great
convenience in tight spaces or when stud access is impossible.  This feature is now available in sizes from 3/4” to 7”
with either a standard stud or heavy stud.  Eccentric and
crowned versions are also available.  Standard hex head
cam followers are available in smaller sizes starting at 1/2”. 
Needle Roller Cam Followers
Needle Roller Cam Followers have a heavy outer ring
cross section and a full complement of needle rollers.  They
offer high dynamic and static load carrying capability, and
anti-friction performance, in a compact design.  They are
used as track rollers, cam followers, and in a wide range of
linear motion systems.
Standard Stud cam followers (page 14) offer the mounting convenience of a threaded stud and are designed to 
accommodate moderate loads.  They are available with and
without seals.  Standard stud cam followers are also available
with crowned outer rings (page 16) for applications where
misalignment is a problem.
Heavy Stud cam followers (page 20) are designed to
provide additional stud strength for applications with 
high loading or shock loads.  Heavy stud cam followers 
are available with and without seals, and with crowned
outer rings (page 22).
Yoke Type cam followers (page 24) are intended 
primarily for applications where loading  conditions 
exceed the capabilities of stud type cam followers, or 
where clevis mounting is desired.  Clevis mounting 
provides support on both sides of the cam follower and
permits use of a high strength pin.  Yoke type cam followers are available with and without seals, and with crowned
outer rings.
CamCentric® adjustable cam followers (page 18) are
used where accurate positioning is required.  They are 
particularly useful for reducing clearance or backlash in
opposed arrangements, and for assuring load sharing in
multiple cam follower installations.  Seals and hex socket
are standard features of CamCentric® adjustable cam 
followers.  Crowned outer rings are also available.
Crowned Outer Rings are used to minimize outer ring
thrusting in applications where the axis of the cam follower is not parallel to the surface of the track or is skewed
relative to the direction of travel.  Crowned outer rings are
a good selection for use with curved or circular tracks.  In
well aligned applications, crowned outer rings can cause
accelerated track wear.
Caged Roller Followers
Caged roller followers (page 26) provide large internal
grease storage capacity for applications where relubrication is
infrequent.  Cage guided rollers and a very heavy outer ring
cross section permit operation at high loads and high speeds.
Caged roller followers are available with and without seals.
The unsealed design provides the additional advantages of
very low friction to  prevent skidding in lightly loaded

applications and provides for flow-through lubrication.
Caged roller followers normally mount directly on a
hardened and ground pin.  RBC offers a line of Precision
Ground Inner Rings (page 28) to simplify application of
caged roller followers.  More information on shaft and
mounting considerations is provided in part 5.4 of the 
technical section (page 45).
Material Handling Rollers and Sheaves
RBC offers a wide range of rollers and sheaves specifically designed for material handling applications—lifting,
conveying, and power transmission.  All RBC rollers and
sheaves use heavy duty roller bearing construction which
provides maximum dynamic and shock capacity for 
longer service life than ball bearing designs.
Lift Truck, Crane and Conveyor Rollers (page 30, 31)
commonly referred to as mast guide rollers or carriage
rollers, are used in lift truck masts and carriages, travelling
cranes, and conveyor lines, where maximum capacity in an
anti-friction roller is required.  Sealed, lubricated-for-life
versions are available.
Chain Sheave and Sprocket Idlers (page 32, 33) for
BL-leaf and ANSI “rollerless” roller hoisting chain are 
essential components of hoisting systems such as lift 
trucks and car lifts.  They are also used as track rollers and
as tensioners in power transmission chain drives.
Airframe Track Rollers 
and Needle Bearings
Airframe track rollers and needle bearings are designed
for high load carrying capability, light weight, and slow
rotation or oscillatory motion.  The exposed surfaces are
plated to provide corrosion resistance.  They are used in 
aircraft flap, slat and control applications, and in numerous
non-aircraft applications.
Series NBC needle bearings (page 34) offer high 
capacity, thin cross section and unitized construction.  
They are commonly used in pivots and linkages.
Series NBE and NBK needle bearings (page 36, 37)
provide a spherical aligning outer ring to allow for misalignment.  Applications and performance characteristics
are otherwise similar to series NBC.
Series NBF and NBL track rollers (page 38, 39) are 
designed with heavy outer ring cross section for track 
roller applications.  They offer a corrosion resistant 
alternative to conventional yoke type cam followers.

he RBC Roller® was developed for customers
needing a high degree of assurance of long cam 
follower life.  It can be used to great advantage in
conveyors, automotive transfer lines or process
industries—food, beverage, plastics, glass and others.
The RBC Roller® is also attractive for defense applications, where system reliability and maintainability
are primary design goals.  The internal design and
construction differ from typical needle bearing, ball
bearing, and tapered roller bearing cam followers.
The RBC Roller® design is unique and is covered by
Patent 5531137.
Two paths of cylindrical rollers create stable outer
ring support.  The comparatively large diameter of
the rollers provides substantially increased dynamic
capacity and fatigue life.  On a size by size basis, the
RBC Roller® offers at least twice, and up to nine times
the fatigue life of conventional needle roller bearing
cam followers.
A center thrust ring in the RBC Roller® imparts
end guidance to the two paths of rollers.  Conventional
needle roller bearing cam followers rely on outer ring
curvature and controlled circumferential clearance for
roller guidance.  The needle rollers often skew during
normal operation, generating unnecessary heat which
can lead to premature failure.  When compared to
needle roller bearing cam followers, end-guided
cylindrical rollers allow the RBC Roller® to run at
lower operating temperatures and higher speeds.
Thrust loading in the RBC Roller® is accommodated through contact between outer ring flanges and
roller ends, and contact between roller ends and the
center thrust ring.  This provides the RBC Roller® with
superior thrust capability.  As a result, the RBC Roller®
is tolerant of tracking misalignment and axial loads
that would overwhelm other designs.
T
®
RBC ROLLER
Stud and Yoke Type
Contacting lip seals are a standard feature of the
RBC Roller®.  These seals ride on smooth ground 
surfaces on the inner ring or stud.  This sealing system provides positive exclusion of solid and 
liquid contaminants, and excellent lubricant retention.
When compared to clearance seals typical of most
cam follower designs, the RBC Roller® contacting lip
seals ensure superior protection in demanding 
environments.
The RBC Roller® is pre-lubricated at the factory
with a high quality mineral oil, NLGI grade 2 grease.
The space between the two paths of rollers which is
created by the center thrust ring provides a large
grease storage cavity.  This larger than normal ability
to store lubricant, in combination with excellent
grease retention of the contacting lip seals, makes the
RBC Roller® virtually maintenance-free.  Under most
operating conditions relubrication is not necessary.
The design of the RBC Roller® provides the additional benefit of positive, unitized construction.
Conventional cam followers rely on swaging or 
staking, particularly in yoke type configurations, to
maintain integrity of the assembly.  If adequate axial
clamping is not provided, these designs can drift
apart and cause catastrophic failure.  During assembly of the RBC Roller®, the center thrust ring permanently engages a circumferential groove in the stud or
inner ring.  This design feature ensures integrity 
of the assembly during handling and operation, and
simplifies mounting design.
The RBC Roller® is available in stud and yoke type
configurations.  Standard sizes range from 1 1/4
inches outside diameter to 10 inches outside diameter.  The RBC Roller® is dimensionally interchangeable with standard needle roller bearing cam follower
designs.


Large Grease Storage Cavity
Maintenance-Free: Large grease
storage cavity and true contacting lip
seals provide superior contaminant
exclusion and lubricant retention for
maintenance-free operation.
Patent No. 5531137
Contacting Lip Seals
Center Thrust Ring
Increased Life: large diameter, endguided rollers yield maximum capacity
and increased fatigue life, accommodate
thrust loading more effectively, and provide higher limiting speeds.

BC Bearings
offers the new HexLube®
Universal line of cam followers, designed with a unique 
lubricating feature.  The RBC
HexLube® Universal Cam Follower
allows for relubrication through the
hexagonal head of the cam follower, making 
relubrication in tight spots possible.  In addition, the
universal design of the RBC HexLube® Cam Follower
can eliminate the need to stock both screwdriver slot
and unsealed cam followers.  RBC expects that most
customers can reduce their inventory on stud type
cam followers by 50% using this new universal line.
The complete line is available in sizes with an outside
diameter from 3/4 inch to 7 inches.
The RBC HexLube® Universal Cam Follower
design provides the easiest and fastest way to 
relubricate cam followers in hard to reach places or in
applications where stud access is limited.  A cam 
follower that is properly maintained and lubricated
will last longer than a cam follower that is neglected
due to the difficulties
posed by relubrication.
Companies looking to
sharply reduce their inventory
levels will recognize the value of
RBC's universal design of the new
HexLube® Cam Follower.  By stocking the RBC HexLube® line, companies will no longer
need to carry inventories of either screwdriver slot or
unsealed cam followers.
The entire line of RBC HexLube® Universal Cam
Followers is dimensionally interchangeable with
other needle bearing cam followers.  The RBC
HexLube® Universal Cam Follower is available in
both eccentric and crowned versions.  Both standard
studs and heavy studs are available as well.
RBC HexLube® Universal Cam Followers are 
designed for applications such as automation and
production equipment, bottling and canning,
printing machinery, material handling, construction
equipment, transfer lines, food processing, and 
packaging equipment.

BC developed the Universal Cam Follower
product line to replace standard cam followers, and
delivered two obvious benefits.  First, it is possible to
relubricate the hex head cam follower through the
head.  The hex head feature is the preferred mounting
method for stud-type cam followers, and now it can
be relubricated in tight spots or when stud access is 
restricted.  Second, the HexLube® can eliminate the
need to stock both screwdriver slot and unsealed cam 
followers.  Your inventory can be reduced by about 50%! 
RBC looked at the cam follower market and found
358 line items and five manufacturers (1790 line items!)
The challenge was to reduce the number of part numbers needed to satisfy the market without sacrificing
features and benefits.  The answer was the “Universal
Cam Follower Product Line.”  The HexLube® cam follower allows lubrication through the head of the cam
follower, eliminating the need to stock the screwdriver
slot series. Also eliminated from the line were all unsealed cam followers. Reducing your inventory by this
large amount results in real savings.  The end result is
a product line with just 186 line items!

Inner Rings
(See page 28)
Nominal
Normal operating loads should not exceed the bearing dynamic capacity.
Roller followers used without inner rings require a shaft with minimum hardness of Rc 58 and surface finish of 16 rms or better.
Standard configuration of roller follower series SRF-- SS is with seal lips facing outward. To specify roller followers with seal lips facing
inward, replace suffix -SS with suffix -RR. (example: SRF 30 RR).

2 For oscillatory application with angle of oscillation less than critical angle,
consult RBC engineering department for revised fatigue calculation.
3 Speed limit of sealed roller followers is determined by maximum seal surface speed.
For roller followers without seals, speed limit may be increased by 30% with oil lubrication.

TECHNICAL DATA
the outer ring around the point of contact.  The effects
are outer ring deformation with reversed bending
stresses in dynamic applications, a reduced load 
zone, and a higher maximum roller load (see Fig. 1.).
To keep deformation to a minimum, the outer ring of
a cam follower must have a considerably heavier 
cross section than a standard bearing.  This requirement conflicts with the desire for maximum dynamic
bearing capacity which needs as large a roller diameter as possible.  RBC cam followers and yoke rollers
provide an optimum compromise between outer ring
strength and theoretical bearing capacity.
2. Capacity and Load Limits
Evaluation of the expected service life and limit loads
of cam followers is more complex than with housed
bearings.  In addition to the static and dynamic capacity
of the rolling elements, outer ring deformation, track 
capacity, and cam follower stud bending stress must be
considered.  In yoke rollers, the pin shear stress must be
considered.
RBC lists the static bearing capacity for reference
purposes only.  Typically, the maximum allowable load
is a function of the maximum permissible bending
stress of the stud or the outer ring.  For best results, the
operating loads should not exceed the lower of track
capacity or 50% of the dynamic capacity.
2.1 Capacity of Rolling Element Bearing
Equations for static and dynamic capacities of roller
bearings are given in ANSI/ABMA Standard 11.  The
more recent revisions leave it up to the manufacturer to
introduce factors which account for internal design 
features and operating conditions.  For cam followers
and yoke rollers RBC has chosen to apply a conservative
rating system, so a direct comparison with capacity 
figures of competitive products may not be possible.

Safety Precaution
In rare cases a bearing failure may cause great mechanical damage or even lead to personal injury.  To help prevent such losses, you may contact RBC’s engineering
staff to review your application details.  The engineering
staff’s review will assist you in identifying potential problem areas and suggest modifications to improve bearing
performance in your application.  The engineering staff at
RBC has many years of experience with a large variety of
applications and operating conditions.  If you have a safety
related application and would like an evaluation by RBC’s
engineering department, please submit your application
details in confidence.
1. Difference from Standard Bearings
The outer rings of regular ball and roller bearings
are typically mounted in rigid housings providing
support around the entire circumference.  Individual
roller forces are transmitted through the outer ring
directly into the housing with no major deformations.
By contrast, cam followers and yoke rollers are 
supported at a single point on their circumference.
Individual roller forces produce bending moments on

Track capacity is that load which a track subject to a
uniform contact stress can withstand without excessive
plastic deformation.  It is directly related to track hardness.  The published track capacity is based on a hardness
of HRc 40.  For other track hardness values the track
capacity must be modified with factors from Table 1.

2.3. Bending and Shear Stresses
2.3.1 Cam Follower Stud Bending Stress
If the load over the width of the outer ring is
evenly distributed, it may be replaced by a single
concentrated force F [lbf] acting at the center of the
cam follower (see Fig.2). Assuming that the cam 
follower stud has been tightly mounted in a housing
bore flush with the end plate, this concentrated force
generates a bending moment Mb.
where       B = outer ring width  [in]
1/32 = cam follower overhang [in]
The bending moment generates a bending stress
in the cam follower stud of approximate magnitude
where
SD=Stud Diameter [in]
Standard cam follower studs are heat treated to a
hardness of HRc 58 min in the raceway area only.
Fig. 2
Table 1. Track Capacity Adjustment Factors.
Alternatively, contact stress can be easily calculated and compared directly to the strength of material.  The equation for the Hertz contact stress between a cylindrical cam follower outer ring and a flat
steel track is given by “Roark, Formulas for Stress
and Strain” as:
F = radial load [lbf]
leff = length of outer ring contact [in]
D = outer ring diameter [in]
It can be shown that for infinite life the ultimate
tensile strength of track and roller must be at least
equal to the maximum contact stress

Determine the required minimum track hardness

Referring to Table 1,  149,800 psi is between 146,000 psi
(HRc32) and 165,000 (HRc 36).  Interpolation yields a
minimum track hardness of HRc 33.


42
The hardness in other areas of the stud is typically in a
range of HRc 20 -22 with an ultimate strength of 
material of 110,000 -120,000 psi. RBC bases the maximum allowable load of stud type cam followers on a
theoretical  stud bending stress of 100,000 psi. Standard stud cam followers and heavy stud cam followers differ in stud diameter, which permits higher 
operating loads and more resistance to impact loading for the heavy stud version.  High stud strength
cam followers are available by special order.
In most applications the stud will deflect away
from the load, which causes the point of attack to 
shift toward the support, shortening the moment 
arm and reducing the effective bending moment (see
Fig. 3).  Tests show that this deflection yields a safety
factor of at least 2 over RBC’s maximum allowable
load. However, this effect may not be sufficient to
avoid damage in severely misaligned applications
where the load is applied at the very extreme outboard edge of the cam follower outer ring.
Where misalignment is a problem, RBC recommends crowned cam followers.
Example 2
Cam follower S 64 L supports a load of 6,000 lbf.
The stud diameter is .875", the outer ring width 1.25".
Determine the theoretical bending stress at the stud
housing interface.
Solution:  
Fig. 3
2.3.2 Yoke Roller Pin Shear Stress
Yoke rollers are mounted with a pin in a yoke.
Under load the pin is subject to shear and bending
stresses.  RBC recommends that the yoke arms are
located as close to the yoke roller as possible, so that
bending stress can be ignored.  In case of widely
spaced pin supports, the resulting pin deflection may
cause yoke roller damage.
The pin shear stress can be calculated with
where              d=pin diameter
The permissible stress depends on the pin material
selection.
Example 3
Determine the shear stress of the .375 in. diameter pin
for yoke roller Y 40 L, loaded radially with 3,200 lbf.
Solution: 
2.4 Outer Ring Stress and Deformation
The exact calculation of these values is beyond the
scope of this introduction.  The following method
may be used for a (high) first estimate of the outer
ring tensile stress at the inside diameter opposite the
contact point of a single row cam or roller follower.
The assumption is that the entire load is supported by
only 2 rollers straddling the point of contact:
where        F = cam follower load [lbf]

D = outer ring outside diameter [in]

In case of constant load, the equivalent radial load
equals the constant load.  To compute the equivalent
load for all other cases, use:
(9)
where 
q = 10/3 for roller bearings
Ft = individual radial load [lbf]
4. Speed Limit and Maximum Acceleration
4.1 Speed Limit
The limiting speed of rolling element bearings is
primarily a function of size and internal design.  The
speed limits given in this catalog should not be
exceeded on a continuous basis to prevent premature
failure due to excessive temperature.  Contact RBC for
solutions to high speed applications.
4.2 Maximum Acceleration (Deceleration)
A sufficiently large tangential friction force Ft , 
acting between outside diameter and track is needed
to change the rotational speed of cam follower and
yoke roller outer rings.
(10)
where
µ = coefficient of friction
(outer ring to track)
The force Ft produces a moment  Mt, which must
accelerate the masses of outer ring and rollers around
the bearing axis, plus the rollers in the load zone
around their own axes.
Example 4 
Estimate the outer ring tensile stress of yoke roller 
Y 56 L subject to a load of 6,000 lbf.  The yoke roller
has 25 rollers, the outer ring outside diameter = 1.750
in., the outer ring raceway diameter =1.125 in., the
idealized outer ring width  = .690 in.
Solution:
3.  Fatigue Life
Fatigue life, L10 [rev, hrs], is a statistical measure of
the life which 90% of a large group of apparently identical rolling element bearings will complete or exceed.
For a single bearing, L10 also refers to the life associated with 90% reliability.
The relationship  between  fatigue or rating life, capacity
and load is:
(6)
where
L10 rev = Rating life [106 rev]
C = Dynamic capacity [lbf]
Pe = Equivalent radial load
To obtain the rating life in hours, use
(7)
L10 hrs = Rating life [hours]
where   
ne = equivalent speed [rpm]
In case of constant speed, the equivalent speed equals
the constant bearing speed.  In all other cases the
equivalent speed is the weighted average of all individual speed components.

where     ni = individual speed component [rpm]

RBC offers  a convenient socket (W suffix) for hex
wrenches to provide a more substantial grip, especially for ‘blind hole’ applications.
5.2  Eccentric Cam Followers
Eccentric cam followers are used when there is a
need to make height adjustments between the cam 
follower and the track.  By simply turning the entire
cam follower inside the housing it is possible to 
adjust the distance between the cam follower and the
track by twice the eccentricity.  However, due to the
mechanical advantage that the eccentricity provides, 
it is inadvisable that the cam follower be adjusted 
over this entire range.
A very large force can be exerted on the track for a
small applied adjusting torque as the eccentricity of
the cam follower approaches ±90 degrees from a 
starting position parallel to the track, in the housing.
Adjustments should be limited to ±45 degrees and 
the resulting preload should not exceed 10% of the
cam follower’s capacity.
The following equation can be used to find an
appropriate adjusting torque.
T = 0.1 * C * e * cos 45°
[in * lbf]
where        T = appropriate adjusting torque [lbf]
C = cam followers dynamic capacity [lbf]
e = eccentricity of cam follower [in]
Example 5
CamCentric cam follower S48LWX has a dynamic
capacity of 4,600 lb, and an eccentricity of 0.03 in.
Determine the appropriate adjusting torque.
Solution: 
T = 4,600 lbf * 0.03 in * 0.070711 = 9.76 in * lbf
The moment Mt can be calculated using:
Accelerating the mass of the outer ring normally 
requires the largest part of moment Mt.  Assuming 
a coefficient of friction of µ = 0.10 and a typical cam 
follower design, the following equation may be used for
an estimate of the permissible angular acceleration α:
(12)
Excessive acceleration causes sliding of the outer
ring on the track.  The effects range from minor 
uniform wear on cam follower and track to flat spots
on the cam follower with subsequent failure.
5. Mounting
5.1 Cam Followers
For greatest rigidity and strength, the end plate
should be drawn up snugly against a boss or other
flat surface of the housing.  The tables on pages 8
throughout 23 list the maximum recommended
clamping torque for lubricated threads, which is the
normal condition.  Use up to twice the listed torque
for completely dry threads.
The housing bore should be drilled and reamed to
the recommended tolerance.  If a greater tolerance is
needed, it should be added to the plus side to prevent
cam follower damage during assembly.  If the cam 
follower stud fits tightly into the housing bore, use an
arbor press and apply pressure against the central
portion of the flange.  Never press against the rim of
the flange or the outer ring.
Although wide blade screwdrivers may be used to
hold slotted head cam followers during assembly,
rounded tools conforming to the slot are preferable to
avoid plastic deformation in the slot area.

cam followers require relubrication 
depending on operating speed, duty cycle, operating
environment, desired service life, etc. 
For relubrication in service, mineral oil, or any good
roller bearing grease on mineral oil basis may be used.
Inquire about compatibility of greases with different
base oil and thickener.
Except for the very small sizes (see tables), cam 
followers with screwdriver slots can be relubricated
from both ends of the stud and through the housing.
Table 2 lists suitable drive fit Alemite fittings.  Plugs 
are furnished by RBC to close off unused passages.
Table 2. Alemite fittings.
Cam followers of the HexLube® series are supplied
5.3 Yoke Rollers
RBC yoke rollers correspond in many respects to the
same size cam follower, except they are mounted on a
pin for use in yoke type applications for greater shock 
resistance.
Yoke rollers should be clamped axially or mounted
within closely fitting side rails to prevent displacement
of the end plates.  For applications with heavy loads, it 
is recommended to heat treat the pin and use a press fit
for the inner ring.  A soft pin and light press or push fit
are sufficient for lightly loaded applications.  When 
press fitting a yoke roller, pressure should be applied
centrally and uniformly against the end plate, never
against the outer ring.
The pin should have a suitable lead-in chamfer or
radius to prevent scoring and to hold the mounting
force to a minimum.
5.4 Caged Roller Followers
Caged roller followers can operate directly on a hardened and ground shaft (HRc 58 min, 16 rms min surface
finish) or can be used with matching inner rings.  Operating without an inner ring yields the largest possible shaft
diameter with greatest strength and rigidity.  Axial 
guidance must be provided by the application.  It is 
recommended to use hardened steel or bronze thrust
washers with radial lubricating grooves as needed.
6.1 Track Lubrication
In most applications it is difficult to eliminate all cam
follower misalignment.  Misalignment causes the outer
ring to thrust, which in needle bearing cam followers,
produces wear of the seal followed by wear of the outer
ring face and the stud flange or the end plate.  In RBC
Rollers ® the wear is generallly limited to the center thrust
ring.  Misalignment where the axis of the cam follower is
not perpendicular to the direction of rolling, typically
produces the most severe thrust and also causes wear on
the cam follower outside diameter, and the track.  To
reduce these symptoms as much as possible, the track
must be lubricated.  Lubrication also reduces wear stemming from excessive acceleration.  Oil and grease are
acceptable lubricants.
If the track cannot be lubricated, contact RBC Engineering for a review of the operating parameters to ensure that
they do not exceed the limits of the bearing selected.
6.2 Bearing Lubrication
Cam followers and yoke rollers are pre-lubricated
with an NLGI grade 2, lithium soap, mineral oil based
grease with EP additives.  RBC Roller® type cam followers and yoke rollers are normally lubricated for life and
have no provisions for relubrication.  Needle roller type

rollers and sealed roller followers must be relubricated
through the shaft.
7. Misalignment
Initial misalignment should not exceed .001 in./in.
Any misalignment generates thrust forces between outer
ring and flange or end plate.  Excessive thrusting can lead
to increased operating temperature and destruction of the
seal in standard cam followers and yoke rollers.  Where
misalignment and outer ring thrusting cannot be avoided,
RBC recommends crowned outer rings or the RBC Roller®
design which is more capable of withstanding  thrust 
loads.  Contact RBC engineers about thrust and load limits.
8. Operating Temperature
The temperature limits of all standard cam followers
and yoke rollers in this catalog, except airframe bearings,
are determined by the temperature limits of the seals and
the lubricant. With lower temperatures, grease gradually
becomes stiffer, increasing the rolling resistance of the
cam follower.  Any application with the cam follower
operating continuously below 0° F (-18° C), consult with
RBC Engineering for a specific low temperature grease.
The maximum continuous operating temperature is
+250° F (120° C), and for short periods, the maximum
temperature may rise to +300° F (150° C). For continuous
operation above +250° F (120° C), consult with RBC
Engineering to determine the need for special high temperature grease and seal material.
RBC can provide special solutions for applications
outside the normal operating temperature range.

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
Material Handling Equipment
Carriage rollers and side rollers of lift trucks are typical
applications where roller followers have performed exceedingly well.  The heavy walled outer ring eliminates the need
for a separate tire and bearing assembly.
Drum Cam
A pair of heavy stud cam followers are shown mounted in
linkages activated by a drum cam or grooved rotating shaft.
A lubrication hole through the stud accepts a drive fitting
for periodic relubrication.
Rewind Stands
Rewind stands for packaging material or printed coils make
use of cam followers.  A simple two or three point support
consists simply of several cam followers acting on the journal
or body of the roll.  The upper bracket is optional and a very
quick changeover results in either case.

47
Table Supports
Yoke rollers may be effectively mounted to support tables,
tracks or other machine members requiring linear motion.
The illustration depicts horizontal location between yoke
rollers, but this may be achieved by cam followers or CamCentric® followers as well.
Turntable Mounting
Cam followers can be mounted in a circular housing to
support a ring or thrust plate.  Precise leveling adjustment
for the turntable can be obtained using the adjustable
CamCentric® cam follower.
Internal Combustion Engines
RBC's yoke roller followers have found wide acceptance as
valve tappet and fuel injection rollers.  The outer ring
flanges support the cage against high inertia loads assuring
positive, individual roller control by the cage.

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
Cluster Mounting
Cluster mounting of four cam followers around a square
column demonstrates the unique versatility of these bearings.
Threads are concentric with the shank within very close 
limits.  This feature is important on “blind hole” mountings
where run-out would result in binding.
Manual Lift Truck
Schematic arrangement of cam followers is shown on the
upright of a warehouse hand truck.  CamCentric® bearings
are frequently used to provide adjustment so that all bearings
contact the track without critical hole positioning.
Textile Machinery
The sealed yoke rollers work extremely well as  picking rolls
of looms due to the fact that the minimum friction assures
constant turning to eliminate wear.
