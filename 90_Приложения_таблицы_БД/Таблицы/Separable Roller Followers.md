●C-Lube Roller Followers
●Cylindrical Roller Followers
IKO Roller Followers are bearings designed for outer 
ring rotation, in which needle rollers are incorporated 
in a thick walled outer ring.  Both crowned and cylindrical outer rings are available.  The outer rings run 
directly on mating cam guide surfaces, and the 
crowned outer ring is effective in relieving the edge 
load caused by mounting errors.  The cylindrical outer 
ring, on the other hand, has a large contact area with 
the mating cam guide surface and is suitable for applications involving large loads or low cam guide surface 
hardness.
In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings 
available, the caged type and the full complement 
type.  The caged type is useful for applications at 
high-speed rotation.  The full complement type, on the 
other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at 
low-speed rotation or oscillating motions.
Roller Followers include separable and non-separable 
types.  Also, in addition to the open type, shield type 
and sealed type are available.  The clearances 
between the side plates and outer ring of the shield 
type are narrow, and form labyrinths.  In the sealed 
type, special synthetic rubber seals are assembled in 
these clearances, and they are effective in preventing 
penetration of dust and dirt.
These bearings are available in a variety of types  to 
suit almost any kind of application.  They are widely 
used for cam mechanisms and for linear motions of 
conveying equipment.

■Types
In Roller Followers, types shown in Table 1 are available.
Separable Roller Followers
These bearings are assembled by combining an outer 
ring, inner ring and Needle Roller Cage, which can be 
separated from one another.  Thus, handling is easy. 
Oil lubrication is also easy, making them suitable for 
high-speed rotations.
There are two types: type without inner ring RNAST 
and type with inner ring NAST.  The type with inner 
ring includes open type, shield type, and sealed type.
Non-separable Roller Followers
These non-separable type bearings have side plates 
fixed on both sides of the inner ring, and include the 
caged type and the full complement type.  Both shield 
type and sealed type are available.  As well, these 
bearings also offer a highly corrosion-resistant stainless steel specification, of which the products are suitable for applications where rust prevention oil is not 
preferred, such as in cleanroom environments.
Inch series Non-separable Roller Followers are full 
complement type bearings with black oxide surface 
treatment.

C-Lube Roller Followers
These Roller Followers are lubricated with C-Lube, an 
IKO original thermosetting solid-type lubricant which 
fills the inner space of the bearing. C-Lube is lubricant 
made of a lot of lubricant and fine particles of superhigh molecular polyolefin that are solidified by heat 
treatment. As the bearing rotates, the lubricant oozes 
out onto the raceway in proper quantities, maintaining 
the lubrication performance for a long period of time.
Cylindrical Roller Followers
These bearings are full complement type bearings 
incorporating double rows of full complement 
cylindrical rollers in the outer ring, and can withstand 
large radial loads.
Additionally, the outer ring is guided by the outer ring 
shoulder and the end face of cylindrical rollers to the 
axial direction.

■Clearance
Radial internal clearances of Roller Followers are 
based on Table 6.
■Fit
Roller Followers are generally used under the loading 
conditions in which the load direction is fixed in relation to the inner ring and rotates in relation to the 
outer ring.  The recommended fits for shafts are 
shown in Table 7.  Those for the inch series are 
shown in the dimension table.
■Maximum allowable static load
The load that is applicable to Roller Followers is, in 
some cases, determined by the strength of the outer 
ring rather than by the load rating of the needle roller 
bearing.  Therefore, the maximum allowable load that 
is limited by the strength of outer ring is specified.

■Track Capacity
(Tensile strength 1250N/mm2).  When the hardness of 
the mating cam guide surface differs from 40HRC, the 
track capacity is obtained by multiplying the value by 
the track capacity factor shown in Table 9.
If lubrication between the outer ring and the mating 
cam guide surface is insufficient, seizure and/or wear 
may occur depending on the application.  Therefore, 
pay attention to lubrication and surface roughness of 
the mating cam guide especially in the case of highspeed rotation such as for cam mechanisms.
Track capacity is defined as the load that can be continuously applied on a Roller Follower placed on a steel 
cam guide surface without causing deformation and 
indentation on the cam guide surface when the outer 
ring of the Roller Follower makes contact with the mating cam guide surface (plane).  The track capacities 
shown in Tables 8.1 and 8.2 are applicable when the 
hardness of the mating cam guide surface is 40HRC

■Allowable Rotational Speed
The allowable rotational speed of Roller Followers is 
affected by mounting and operating conditions. For dn 
value with only pure radial load applied, use values in 
Table 10 or less as a guideline. 
Considering that axial loads also act under actual 
operating conditions, the recommended dn value is 
1/10 of the value shown in the table. 
For use with oscillating rotation, use a C-Lube Roller 
Follower dn value of 8,000 or less as a guideline. For 
use with one-way or continuous rotation, please consult IKO.
■Lubrication
In Sealed Type Roller Followers, Heavy Duty Type 
Roller Followers and  Inch series Roller Followers, 
ALVANIA GREASE S2 (Shell Lubricants Japan K.K.) 
is prepacked as the lubricating grease.
For Roller Followers without prepacked grease, 
grease or oil should be supplied through the oil hole 
of the inner ring for use.  If they are used without lubrication, wear of rolling contact surfaces may take 
place, leading to a short bearing life.
■Oil Hole
Open Type  Separable Roller Followers have no oil 
hole.  Inner rings of other types of Metric series Roller 
Followers have  an oil hole.  Inch series inner rings 
have an oil groove and an oil hole.

Fig. 1  Mating seating dimension "a"
Fig. 2  Position of oil hole and load direction
Fig. 3  Mounting example of Roller Follower 
  without inner ring
In case of shield and sealed types, match the side 
surface correctly to the mating seating surface indicated by the dimension a shown in the dimension 
table, and fix them.  (See Fig. 1.)
When mounting Roller Followers, pay special attention to avoid locating the oil hole of the inner ring 
within the loading zone.  This may lead to a short 
bearing life.  (See Fig. 2.)
When mounting Sealed Type Separable Roller 
Followers, do not cause the side plates to come off. 
If they come off, set them again in place taking care 
to avoid damaging the seal lips.
In case of Roller Followers without an inner ring, 
the shaft requires heat treatment and grinding finish.  The recommended surface hardness of the 
shaft is 58 〜64HRC, and the recommended roughness of the shaft is 0.2μmRa or less.
Also, the outer ring and cage are guided by side 
surfaces of the mounting parts.  Therefore, it is recommended that the side surfaces of the mounting 
parts be finished by grinding or at least by machining.(See Fig. 3.)
In Non-separable Roller Followers, the side plates are 
press-fitted. Therefore, when mounting the Roller 
Followers, do not push the side plates/outer rings.
Pushing on the side plates or outer rings may 
cause unsatisfactory product performance.
