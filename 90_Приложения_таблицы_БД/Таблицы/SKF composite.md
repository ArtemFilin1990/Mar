Compact and maintenance-free
Composite plain bearings are primarily used 
for bearing arrangements where heavy loads 
have to be supported and where rotational or 
oscillating movements are relatively slow. 
Because of their good sliding properties and 
compact design, these plain bearings are particularly suitable for bearing arrangements 
where
• maintenance-free operation is  
a prerequis­ite
• there is a risk of lubricant starvation
• lubricants can not be used or are forbidden
• space is limited.
Typical application examples for SKF composite plain bearings can be found on pages 49 
to 57.
Characteristics
The important characteristics of SKF composite plain bearings include
• maintenance-free
• no lubrication required (PTFE composite)
• initial lubrication required (POM composite)
• minimum wall thickness, minimum space 
requirements
• accommodation of heavy loads
• wide range of operating temperatures
• good sliding properties
• virtually no stick-slip
• high wear-resistance
• less sensitive to edge loading  
(POM composite)
• no machining required.
The assortment
The standard range of SKF composite plain 
bearings is very comprehensive and covers 
almost every standard size. The range is shown 
in the product overview in table 1 and comprises
• straight bushings
• flanged bushings
• thrust washers
• strips.

Materials
There are two standard types of composite 
material for SKF plain bearings: PTFE composite and POM composite. Each is suit­able 
for different applications.
PTFE composite bearings consist of a sheet 
steel backing on which a 0,2 to 0,4 mm thick 
porous layer of tin/bronze is sintered 
(† fig. 1). By a rolling process, the pores of 
the sintered layer are filled with a mixture of 
PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and molybdenum disulphide (designation suffix E). 
An additional 5 to 30 μm thick running-in 
­layer of the mixture is then applied to the sintered tin/bronze. This additional layer provides 
an optimum combination of the mechanical 
properties of the sintered tin/bronze and the 
good sliding and lubricating properties of the 
PTFE mixture. PTFE composite bearings have 
good dimensional stability and thermal conductivity.
Like PTFE composite bearings, POM composite 
bearings also have a sheet steel backing that 
is covered with a 0,2 to 0,4 mm thick layer of 
sintered tin/bronze († fig. 2). The principal 
characteristic of these bearings is their relatively thick (0,3 mm) layer of acetal resin (POM 
– polyoxymethy­l­ene) that is firmly attached to 
the sintered tin/bronze layer. The covering 
layer has ­pockets to retain grease.
The thickness of the covering layer makes 
these bearings less sensitive to misaligment 
and the edge loading associated with that 
misalignment.

Machinability of 
composite materials
With the exception of the sliding layer, SKF 
composite bushings can be machined using 
conventional methods.
If bushings are required to have a smaller 
width than the standard size, this can easily 
be achieved by turning. It is also possible to 
drill lubrication holes. However, any burrs 
must be removed, particularly from the 
­sliding surface. 
Strips can be bent, pressed, cut, or drilled 
to fit the individual application. When cutting 
or drilling, it is advisable to work from the sliding surface side to avoid creating burrs in the 
sliding layer. 
Any metal surfaces that are exposed as  
a result of machining should be protected 
against corrosion.
Machining the bore of 
PTFE composite bushings
PTFE composite bushings conform to 
ISO 3547:2006 and are ready for installation. 
Any re-sizing of the bore, i.e. the sliding surface, will reduce the service life of the bushings and should only be done in exceptional 
cases. If re-sizing is necessary, the bore 
should be calibrated, using a mandrel/resizing 
tool († fig. 3).
Because various criteria, like material and 
wall thickness of the housing as well as the 
deviation of cylindrical form, have to be taken 
into consideration, SKF recommends using  
a calibrated mandrel to re-size the bore. After 
resizing, bushing bore expansion tests and 
application field tests should be undertaken 
prior to the release of a final product. When 
machining the calibrating mandrel, the diameter dk should be made in a first step about 
60 to 80 μm larger than the maximum value 
listed in the column “Bore diameter of mounted 
bushing” in table 1 on page 16.
Guideline values for the requisite interference of the calibrating mandrel as a function 
of the desired widening of the bushing bore 
for various bushing bore diameters can be 
obtained from diagram 1. The diagram is 
based on tests with bushings of different sizes 
and valid for bushings mounted in a housing 
with an outside diameter DG = 2 ¥ bushing 
outside diameter D († fig. 3). If mandrel 
expansion tests show that the bore is too 
wide, the calibrating mandrel should be 
reground and the tests repeated on new 
bushings.
Machining the bore of  
POM composite bushings
Bushings made of POM composite material 
are ready for installation. However, if necessary, the bushing bore can be machined to 
size while mounted in its housing. After 
machining the bore, the sliding surface should 
have an Ra value of max 2,5 μm. The following machining recommendations will provide 
good results when a poly-crystalline diamond 
cutting tool is used
• cutting speed > 150 m/min
• slow feed rate (0,05 to 0,1 mm/revolution)
• cutting depth 0,1 mm.
To prevent excessive heat build-up of the 
acetal resin, and to remove the swarf produced during machining, a constant supply of 
compressed air (at a low pressure) should be 
applied to the bushing during any machining 
operation.

Friction
Load, sliding velocity and operating temperature are primary factors in determining the 
friction in composite plain bearings. Friction is 
also influenced by the roughness of the surface on which the bearing runs, the degree of 
contamination and the lubrication conditions.
For PTFE composite bearings, the coefficient of friction m lies between 0,03 and 0,25 
depending on the operating conditions. Similar values are found for the POM composite 
material, but the presence or constant supply 
of lubricating fluids serves to decrease friction. The lowest values are normally obtained 
where there are high specific loads and low 
sliding velocities († guideline values for µ in 
diagram 2). Under particularly unfavourable 
operating conditions, like light loads, high 
velocities or inadequate surfaces, the max­
imum guideline values may be exceeded.  
The coefficient of friction for PTFE composite 
bearings increases at temperatures above 
+100 °C.
Stick-slip effects are negligible for PTFE 
and POM bearings. 
Running-in
During a short running-in phase there will  
be some transfer of PTFE material from the 
covering layer to the counterface. After this 
transfer has taken place, the characteristic 
low friction and wear properties of these 
bearings will be obtained.
Chemical properties
The steel backing and the sintered tin/bronze 
layer are the primary factors in determining 
the chemical resistance of SKF composite 
plain bearings, as the sliding (covering) layers 
are resistant to most chemicals. The covering 
layer is virtually inert because of its PTFE 
content, although at elevated temperatures 
molten alkali metals and free fluorine will 
attack it. The acetal resin-covering layer of the 
POM composite bearing is largely resistant to 
organic substances.
At room temperature the sintered tin/bronze 
structure has good resistance to sea water, 
steam, atmospheric influences, salt solutions 
and sulphuric acid, but not to oxidizing acids 
or media containing ammonia.
All exposed surfaces of the steel backing 
are electrolytically tin-plated but this provides 
only limited protection against corrosion in 
most applications. In cases where the bearings 
are to be exposed to corrosive media, or 
where there is a danger of corrosion in the 
contact between the steel backing and the 
housing material, the backing can be protected 
by a nickel, chromium or zinc coating applied 
electrolytically. Further details can be supplied 
on request.
Electrical properties
Bearings made from POM composite, because 
of their acetal resin-covering layer, may act as 
electrical insulators when new. To avoid the 
build-up of static electricity, components at 
risk should be grounded.

Selection of bearing size
The load carrying ability and wear characteristics of SKF composite plain bearings are 
governed by the specific conditions of a particular application. Therefore, any calculation 
can only provide approximate values. In order 
to determine the required size of a bearing, 
the load carrying capacity, the applied loads, 
the rating life requirements and operational 
reliability must all be considered. The load 
carrying capacity is expressed by the basic 
dynamic load rating C and the basic static load 
rating C0. Values of the load ratings can be 
found in the product tables.
Basic dynamic load ratings
The basic dynamic load rating C is used 
together with other influencing factors, to 
determine the basic rating life of a bearing.  
As a rule it represents the maximum load that 
a bearing can sustain at room temperature 
when the sliding contact surfaces are in 
motion. The maximum permissible load in any 
individual application should always be considered in relation to the desired rating life. 
The basic dynamic load ratings quoted in the 
product tables are based on the effective projected sliding surface and the specific load 
factor K that takes the different composite 
materials into consideration. 
It is assumed in this definition that the load 
acting on a bushing or flanged bushing is 
purely radial and that the load acting on a 
thrust washer is purely axial and applied at 
the centre. Dynamic load conditions are 
essentially oscillating movements or rotations 
under load, but can include micro sliding 
under variable load (e.g. as a result of vibration) or operation under high frequency alternating loads. Where oscillating movements or 
rotation under load usually produce wear, the 
other conditions may result in fatigue.
Basic static load ratings
The basic static load rating C0 is defined as 
the maximum load that an SKF composite 
bushing, flanged bushing or thrust washer 
can support when stationary at room tem­
perature without permanently deforming the 
sliding layer and jeopardizing its performance. 
It is assumed that the bearing is adequately 
supported by the associated components of 
the bearing arrangement. In order to fully 
exploit the static load rating of a bearing it is 
generally necessary to use shafts and housings made of high-strength materials. The 
basic static load rating must also be considered when bearings are dynamically loaded 
and are subjected to additional heavy shock 
loads. The total load in these cases must not 
exceed the basic static load rating.

Basic rating life
The basic rating life of a composite plain 
bearing is expressed in number of oscillations 
or revolutions, or in operating hours. It represents the operating period under test conditions that is ended when one of the criteria for 
the end of the basic rating life is reached
• increase in operating clearance 
• plastic deformation of the sliding layer
• fatigue. 
A distinction is made between the basic rating 
life and the service life actually achieved.
The basic rating life is a guideline value that 
will be attained or exceeded by the majority of 
a large number of apparently identical bearings under the same test conditions.
The service life actually achieved by apparently identical bearings under identical operating conditions has been found to differ both 
in laboratory endurance tests and in service at 
operating conditions. These include not only 
the magnitude and type of load but also other 
factors such as contamination, corrosion, load 
and movement cycles of high frequency and 
shock loads. These factors are difficult or even 
impossible to quantify.
Requisite bearing size
The type and action mode of the load, the 
­expected operating temperature, lubrication 
and maintenance requirements etc. all in­
fluence the choice of the bearing type and 
­design.
To determine the requisite size of a com­
posite plain bearing, start with the basic rating life for the application. The basic rating life 
will take the type of machine, the operating 
conditions, and operational reliability for that 
machine into consideration.
As a first approximation a guideline value  
of the load ratio C/P = 2 can be used to obtain 
the requisite basic dynamic load rating C.  
A suitable bearing can then be selected from 
the product tables. 
pv operating range
Check whether the chosen size can be used 
under the actual load and sliding velocity conditions using diagram 1 for PTFE composite 
or diagram 2 for POM composite. The data 
required – p (specific bearing load) and v (sliding velocity) – can be calculated using the 
equations provided on page 12.
If the operating data lie within range ! of the 
pv diagram, the basic rating life of the bearing 
can be determined using the equation provided 
in the section “Calculating basic rating life” on 
page 13. If the data lie within the range !! or 
!!! of the diagram, either contact the SKF 
application engineering service or test the 
application to see if the bearing can be used. 
Alternatively, a different bearing can be chosen so that the values for p and v fall within 
range !.
For flanged bushings check the suitability  
of the bushing and flange separately.

Determining specific bearing load

F	=	dynamic bearing load, kN
C	=	basic dynamic load rating, kN
K	=	specific load factor, N/mm2

For flanged bushings, the specific load of the 
bushing and flange should be calculated separately. To calculate the specific load of the 
flange, replace C with Ca in the equation 
above. Values for Ca can be found in the product tables.

Calculating basic rating 
life
Many factors influence the life of a plain bearing, e.g. load, sliding velocity, operating temperature, surface roughness of the counter 
surface against which the composite sliding 
layer runs, etc. Any calculation is therefore 
only approximate.
The values obtained using the basic rating 
life equations are attained by the majority of 
bearings and are often exceeded. This has 
been confirmed by rig tests and field experience. 
The basic rating life for SKF PTFE composite and POM composite plain bearings can be 
calculated from

KM

(pv)n
where
Gh	 =	basic rating life, operating hours
c1 = load factor († diagram 3)
c2 = speed factor († diagram 4)

c5	 =	factor for the type of load

zone is always at the same position on 
the bearing circumference)

zone moves round the circumference 
of the bearing)
KM	=	factor depending on material and 
bearing type

If loads are very light and/or sliding velocities 
are very low and the value of the product pv
• for PTFE composite bearings is less than 
the limiting value of 0,025, then the limiting value pv = 0,025 should be used for the 
life calculations
• for POM composite bearings is less than 
the limiting value of 0,1 then the limiting 
value pv = 0,1, should be used for the life 
calculations.

Calculation example
Two paired PTFE composite bushings are to 
be used in the linkage of a locking system for 
the door of a tramway car.
Design data:
• Pin diameter: d = 20 mm
• Surface roughness of the pin: Ra = 0,4 μm
Operational data:
• Radial load at the linkage:
–	 during closing 0,8 kN per bushing
–	 after locking the closed door the static 
load mounts to 15 kN per bushing
• Half angle of oscillation b = 90° († fig. 1)
• Frequency of oscillation: f = 10 min–1
• Operating temperature: t = 30 °C
Based on the design characteristics two PTFE 
composite bushings PCM 202325 E are  
chosen, having a basic dynamic load rating 
C = 39 kN each.
Check whether the bushings can be used 
under the given operating conditions and 
which basic rating life can be achieved. 
As a first check that the bearing size is suitable († diagram 1 on page 10) the specific 
bearing load p based on the specific load factor K = 80 for PTFE composite is calculated 
using

F	
p = K –– = 80 ¥ –––– ≈ 1,64 N/mm2

The sliding velocity is calculated using 
v	 = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 d b f
	 = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 20 ¥ 90 ¥ 10 = 0,01 m/s
These values are within range ! of the  
pv diagram for PTFE composite bearings 
(† diagram 1 on page 10). Furthermore
• the load factor c1 = 1,3 († diagram 3)
• the speed factor c2 = 1 († diagram 4)
• the temperature factor c3 = 1 
(† diagram 5)
• the surface roughness factor c4 = 0,6 
(† diagram 6)
• the factor for the type of load c5 = 1,5,  
as the load is rotating
• exponent n = 1, for PTFE composite 
­material.
• pv value = 0,025, as the value of product  
p ¥ v = 1,64 ¥ 0,1 = 0,0164 is less than the 
limiting value of 0,025 for PTFE composite 
material († page 13).
Using the material and bearing type factor 
KM = 480 for PTFE composite bushings, the 
basic rating life for the chosen bushings can 
be calculated from 

KM
Gh = c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 ––––

(pv)n

480
Gh = 1,3 ¥ 1 ¥ 1 ¥ 0,6 ¥ 1,5 ¥	 ––––––
 (0,025)1
Gh ≈ 22 500 operating hours 
With a frequency f = 10 min–1, the working 
cycles amount to approximately 13,5 millions. 
The static load of 15 kN lies within the 
dynamic load rating of C = 39 kN and far 
below the static load rating of C0 = 120 kN. 
Thus, the chosen bushings meet the requirements.


Application of bearings
Material and surface finish 
of counterfaces
The factors that are most important to consider when selecting the material and surface 
finish of the counterface (the surface on which 
the bearing slides) are the loading conditions 
(load, angle of oscillation, type of movement 
etc.) and the environmental influences. 
Where there is a risk of corrosion, the 
counterface should be sufficiently resistant. 
Corrosion scars in the counterface and the 
by-product of corrosion (particulate contam­
ination) increase the surface roughness and 
are abrasive and will accelerate wear. In these 
cases, the use of stainless steel or a surface 
treatment such as hard chromium, nickel 
plating or electrolytic oxidation should be considered. 
For PTFE composite and POM composite 
plain bearing arrangements, soft carbon 
steels with a ground surface are usually 
­adequate for the counterface. The surface 
roughness Ra (to EN ISO 4287:1998 and 
EN ISO 1302:2002) should not exceed 
0,4 μm for PTFE composite bearings and 
0,8 μm for POM composite bearings. The corresponding Rz values are 3 and 6 μm, respectively. For more demanding applications the 
use of a hardened counterface is recommended. These should have a surface hardness of at least 50 HRC. Alternatively, hard 
chromium, nickel plating or some other form 
of surface treatment can be considered. In all 
cases Ra should not be greater than 0,3 μm 
(Rz ≤ 2 μm). The better the surface finish, 
the better the running and wear properties 
(† Surface roughness factor c4, diagram 6, 
page 12).
Shaft and housing 
tolerances
SKF recommends machining the seating in 
the housing bore to an H7 tolerance for metric PTFE composite and POM composite plain 
bushings (including flanged bushings), except 
for small bearings with a diameter up to 
4 mm where H6 is recommended. If the shaft 
seating also meets the recommended tolerances, the clearance in the bearing arrangement will lie within the limits provided in 
table 1 on page 16 for PTFE composite plain 
bushings and in table 2 on page 17 for POM 
composite plain bushings, respectively.
The shaft and housing limits for inch bushings are provided in table 3 on page 19 for 
PTFE composite plain bushings and in table 4 
on page 21 for POM composite plain bushings, together with the corresponding limits 
for the bushing bore diameter after mounting 
and the oper­ating clearance. 
The values quoted for operating clearance 
are valid at room temperature. If the oper­
ating temperature is higher than that, it is 
expected that the operating clearance of
• PTFE composite bushings will be reduced 
by 0,0016 mm 
• POM composite bushings will be reduced 
by 0,005 mm
for every 20 °C temperature increase. The 
actual operating clearance can be increased 
or decreased within the recommended limits 
by matching shaft and housing bores having 
appropriate diameter values within the specified limits.
If in certain applications smooth running is 
required, or if the bearing is only lightly loaded, SKF recommends tolerancing the application so that maximum values for operating 
clearance are realized.
The recommended tolerances and guideline limits quoted in the tables are valid for 
steel and cast iron housings. Where light alloy 
housings are used, a greater degree of interference may be required because of the 
­different thermal expansion characteristics of 
the housing and the bushing. There is otherwise a risk that the greater thermal expansion 
of the housing would no longer provide radial 
location for the bushing and that the operating clearance would be too large.
If it is not possible to adopt a greater interference fit, it might be possible to use an ad­
hesive to retain the bushing. In special cases it 
may be necessary, by selecting a suitable tolerance for the shaft, to prevent an inadmissible increase in operating clearance.

Design of associated 
components
Straight bushings
To prevent the sliding surface from becoming 
stepped, the sliding surface of the shaft, i.e. 
the counterface, should always be wider than 
the actual bushing width – particularly where 
axial displacement of the shaft relative to the 
housing may occur as a result of axial expansion.
To facilitate mounting, shaft ends and 
housing bores should have a lead-in chamfer 
with an angle of 10 to 15° († fig. 1). These 
chamfers will make it easier to press the 
bushings into the housing bore and to insert 
the shaft into the bushing bore, without the 
risk of damaging the sliding surface. 
The housing shoulders intended to locate 
the bushing axially should have a diameter 
that is equal to or greater than d + 0,8 mm. 
When PTFE composite bushings operate 
without a lubricant it is especially important to 
accurately align all bearing positions. If misalignment between the positions cannot be 
avoided, take steps during the design stage to 
prevent inadmissibly high edge stresses from 
occurring. For example, the housing bore 
seating can be relieved on both sides, or a 
wider bushing can be used so that it extends 
beyond the housing bore seating on both 
sides († fig. 2).
In case of misalignment have to be compensated for and the operating conditions 
permit the use of POM composite, then the 
bushings of this material should be chosen. 
The covering layer of this material can be 
machined to a minimum degree after the 
bushing has been mounted in a housing bore.
Flanged bushings and thrust 
washers
For shafts that need radial support and axial 
location, flanged bushings or a combination 
bushing-thrust washer († fig. 3) can be used 
depending on the magnitude of the axial load. 
Flanged bushings or thrust washers are 
advantageous even if axial loads are light and 
a surface is not adequate to accommodate the 
thrust, either because the material or its finish 
is unsuitable. 
Note that the counterface should completely cover the sliding surface of the thrust 
washer and the flange of a flanged bushing 
(† fig. 4). For bearing arrangements where 
flanged bushings are used, the transition from 
housing bore to abutment should be chamfered so that it does not contact the bushing 
where it meets the flange († fig. 5).
A thrust washer is generally located in  
a housing recess († fig. 3) and secured by  
a dowel pin or grub screw to prevent it from 
rotating. The appropriate dimensions for this 
type of location are provided in the product 
tables. If for some reason, a recess cannot be 
provided in the housing, the thrust washer 
can be attached to the housing by two pins or 
screws († fig. 6) or by gluing. The heads of 
the pins or screws must be recessed to at 
least 0,3 mm below the sliding surface and 
the entire surface of the thrust washer must 
be supported.

Seals
Seals can decisively influence the service life 
of composite plain bearings. When selecting 
seals consider, for example, the design, the 
available space and the justifiable expense.
Composite plain bearings, particularly the 
POM composite, are able to embed contam­
inant particles and are thus relatively insensitive to contamination. They generally require 
no special protection against normal airborne 
dirt. If, however, the bearing position is subjected to heavier contamination it should be 
sealed from the outside. Simple and efficient 
sealing can be obtained if adjacent components can also serve as seals († fig. 7). 
Radial shaft seals with a low cross section, 
e.g. seals in the G series, as used for needle 
roller bearings, can provide adequate protection for composite plain bearings in most cases († fig. 8). If the demands placed on the 
sealing arrangement are high, it may be necessary to resort to special seals of rubber, 
plastic or similar materials († fig. 9).
In highly contaminated environments, particularly where sand or clay is present, rubber 
or plastic seals tend to have a very short ser­
vice life. Under these conditions, a good seal 
can be achieved by periodically relubricating 
the bushing.

Lubrication
PTFE composite bearings
PTFE composite plain bearings have good dry 
sliding characteristics and do not require lubri­
cation. However, the use of other lubricants 
not normally associated with bearings such  
as water, kerosene or paraffin, can be used.
A lubricant helps to dissipate heat from the 
bearing position as it forms a hydrodynamic 
lubricating film to reduce wear and extend 
bearing service life. However, relubrication is 
also very important. 
If a bearing is greased during mounting to 
enhance sealing or to protect the counterface 
against corrosion, bearing service life will be 
extended, provided the bearing is relubricated 
periodically. If the bearing is not relubricated, 
the grease will form a paste-like mixture with 
the wear particles produced during run-in. 
This paste will significantly accelerate bearing 
wear.
POM composite bearings
POM composite plain bearings require an initial application of grease during mounting. 
Relubrication is not required but the presence 
or constant supply of a lubricating fluid or 
grease can extend bearing service life considerably.
For this reason POM composite bushings 
with a bore diameter ≥ 10 mm and a width  
≥ 12 mm are available as standard with a 
lubrication hole († fig. 1). The hole dimensions and position are in accordance with 
ISO 3547-3:2006. 
Age-resistant greases with a lithium thickener are preferred for operating temperatures 
up to 80 °C, while at higher temperatures, 
sili­cone greases should be used. Greases containing solid lubricants such as molybdenum 
disulphide are totally unsuitable. 
Fig. 1

Mounting
Skill and care in mounting are prerequisites 
for long bearing service life. In addition, cleanliness, and understanding the causes of premature bearing failure can help too. 
Check that the counterface (shaft seating) 
and other components like the housing are 
clean, deburred and that they do not contain 
any abrasive particles. Check also the shaft for 
sharp edges, burrs or surface defects, which 
could damage the sliding surface of the bushings as they are mounted. Once all the components have been cleaned and checked, the 
bushing is ready to be installed. 
To install smaller PTFE or POM bushings, 
with or without a flange, a mounting dolly 
should be used († fig. 1). To do this, place an 
O-ring on the dolly to keep the bushing in 
position. Then drive the bushing into place 
with a mechanical or hydraulic press or by 
tapping the dolly lightly with a hammer. To 
facilitate the mounting of small bushings, 
apply a light coating of oil or grease to the 
housing bore. For larger bushings, SKF recommends using a mounting ring († fig. 2) 
because it aligns and centres the bushing 
while it is being pressed into place. When 
mounting larger bushings, use a solid lubricant paste, like the SKF anti-fretting agent 
LGAF 3E, on the seating to reduce the risk of 
fretting corrosion and also to reduce the force 
required for mounting. 
Composite straight bushings and flanged 
bushings which are to be heavily loaded in 
operation should be mounted so that the butt 
joint is at 90° to the loaded zone during operation († fig. 3), otherwise service life will be 
reduced. When mounting, thrust washers 
should be positioned so that the steel backing 
abuts the housing wall. 
If composite plain bearings are to be located in a housing using an adhesive, the adhesive should be suitable for the expected operating temperature and should have suitable 
expansion, ageing resistance, strength and 
curing properties. If no operational ex­perience 
is available, SKF recommends contacting an 
adhesive manufacturer for advice. When 
­applying an adhesive, care should be taken  
so that no adhesive reaches the sliding surface.

Bearing data – general
The dimensions for metric straight bushings 
are in accordance, with few exceptions, with 
those specified in ISO 3547-1:2006. 
The dimensions of inch bushings, flanged 
bushings and thrust washers have not been 
standardized.
Tolerances
Straight bushings: The tolerances for the outside diameter of metric straight bushings cor­
respond to ISO 3547-1:2006. To check the 
values, use the procedure provided in 
ISO 3547-2:2006. 
Flanged bushings: When mounted, the tolerances are a uniform ±0,5 mm for the flange 
diameter D1 and +0,05/–0,20 mm for the 
width B1.
Thrust washers: The tolerances for the diameters are provided in the product table. The 
tolerances for the height are
• 0/–0,05 mm for PTFE composite washers
• 0/–0,10 mm for POM composite washers.
Strips: The tolerances for the height are
• 0/–0,05 mm for PTFE composite strips
• 0/–0,10 mm for POM composite strips.
Chamfer dimensions: The minimum values 
are provided in the product tables. Chamfer 
dimensions and tolerances for metric sizes 
are provided in table 1.
Operating clearances
The operating clearance of a bushing depends 
on its selected shaft and housing tolerances. 
Guideline values for metric bushings are provided in tables 1 and 2, on pages 16 to 18, 
and for inch bushings in tables 3 and 4 on 
pages 19 to 22. 
Excessive clearance may have a negative 
influence on the service life of PTFE composite bushings if they are not lubricated.
Permissible operating temperature 
range
PTFE composite plain bearings can be used at 
temperatures between –200 and +250 °C.
The operating temperature range for POM 
composite bearings is –40 to +110 °C, al­
though brief periods of operation at +130 °C 
are permissible. 
The service life of SKF composite plain bearings will be reduced if operating tempera­tures 
exceed the limit values. This decrease in service life can be taken into account when calculating the basic rating life by the tempera­ture 
factor c3 († diagram 5, page 12).
Product designations
The basic designation of SKF composite plain 
bearings consists of
• a prefix, a combination of three or four 
­letters, which indicates the bearing type,
• a combination of 4 to 9 figures, identifying 
the size, and 
• suffixes, identifying material and design 
variants.
The prefix PCM identifies a metric and the 
prefix PCZ identifies an inch composite straight 
bushing. Supplementary letters, ­following 
these combinations identify other bearing 
types and have the following meaning:
• F: flanged bushing,
• S: strip,
• W: thrust washer.
In the case of metric bushings, flanged bushings and thrust washers, the combination of  
6 to 9 figures identify the bore diameter (d), 
the outside diameter (D) and the width (B) or 
height (H). For example, a POM composite 
bushing with d = 8 mm, D = 10 mm and 
B = 8 mm is designated PCM 081008 M. 
Small bushings carrying the additional suffix 
VB055 are an exception to this: the outside 
diameter is 0,5 mm larger than indicated in 
the designation.
In the case of composite strips, the combin­
ation of figures identifies width, length and 
height.
The designations for inch bushings are 
similar but in this case the figures only iden­
tify the bore diameter (d) and the width (B)  
in 1/16 ths of an inch. For example a PTFE 
composite bushing with bore diameter 
d = 3/4 = 12/16 inch and B = 1/2 = 8/16 inch is 
designated PCZ 1208 E.
The suffixes used to identify the material 
variant are listed below
• E: layer of PTFE with molybdenum disulphide additives
• M: layer of POM composite.

Maintenance-free 
filament wound bushings
Filament wound bushings are produced by 
winding a self-lubricating composite. The 
sliding layer consists of strands of highstrength polyester and reinforced PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) in an epoxy resin matrix. 
The shell or backing is made of wound highstrength tensioned glass fibre also in an epoxy 
resin matrix. The sliding and backing layers 
are firmly anchored to each other. Both layers 
are produced by winding endless strands in  
a crisscross pattern. 
Modern filament winding technology has 
made it possible to combine the special 
mechanical properties of glass fibre with the 
excellent tribological properties of highstrength thermoplastic and PTFE fibres 
embedded in epoxy resin to produce a new 
innovative bearing material. The defined pos­
ition of the strands in the crisscross pattern 
and the intensive binding between the strands 
and the resin provide very high load carrying 
capacity and wear-resistance. 
Maintenance-free plain bearings, series 
designation PWM, are only available as cylindrical bushings. They are intended for oscillating, rotational and linear movement, where 
there is risk of heavy edge loading and/or 
where chemical resistance and maintenancefree operation are required. They can be used 
at temperatures between –50 and +140 °C.
Assortment
The range of SKF maintenance-free PWM 
bushings currently comprises bushings with 
bore diameters ranging from 20 to 300 mm.
Further information
More information about PWM bushings can

SKF spherical plain 
bearings
For arrangements where alignment movements have to be accommodated between 
two components in relative motion or where 
tilting movements or oscillations occur at rela­
tively low sliding velocities, spherical plain 
bearings are an exellent solution. They have 
an inner ring with a sphered convex outside 
surface and an outer ring with a correspondingly sphered but concave inside surface. 
Wherever spherical plain bearings are needed, whether maintenance-free or not, SKF 
spherical plain bearings can do the job.
Spherical plain bearings with steel-on-steel 
sliding contact surfaces require maintenance. 
The high wear-resistance of the sliding surfaces makes these bearings especially suitable 
for arrangements where there are heavy 
loads in alternating directions, shock loads or 
heavy static loads.
SKF maintenance-free spherical plain 
bearings incorporate special sliding layers of 
advanced materials that have very low friction. They are used in applications where long 
bearing service life is required without maintenance, or where operating conditions like 
inadequate lubrication or the absence of any 
lubricant do not allow the use of steel-onsteel bearings. SKF maintenance-free bearings are produced with three different sliding 
contact surface combinations, depending on 
bearing size and series. These sliding contact 
surface combinations are
• steel/PTFE sintered bronze
• steel/PTFE fabric
• steel/PTFE FRP
Assortment
The comprehensive SKF assortment comprises radial, angular contact and thrust bearings 
and covers a shaft diameter range from 4 to 
1.000 mm.
Further information
For detailed information about SKF spherical 
plain bearings please refer to the
• “SKF Interactive Engineering Catalogue” 
online at www.skf.com
• PUB BU/P1 6116/1 “SKF spherical plain 
bearings and rod ends”
47


SKF rod ends
Rod ends have been designed for use in construction and control rod linkages, for the end 
of piston rods or the base of pneumatic or 
hydraulic cylinders. In these applications, tensile and compressive loads must be transmitted at the same time that alignment movements have to be accommodated. A rod end is 
basically an eye-shaped head with integral 
shank (the housing) and a self-aligning bearing. Most SKF rod ends incorporate a standard spherical plain bearing that is held in the 
housing bore by staking both sides or by 
retaining rings. The wide range of SKF rod 
ends can accommodate a wide range of operating conditions. 
SKF rod ends with steel-on-steel or steelon-bronze sliding contact surfaces require 
maintenance. These rod ends generally 
require periodic relubrication. 
The high wear-resistance of steel-on-steel 
rod ends makes them especially suitable for 
arrangements where loads alternate direction 
or where there are relatively heavy static 
loads. Under these operating conditions but 
where lubricant starvation may be encountered, steel-on-bronze rod ends are recommended. 
SKF maintenance-free rod ends are produced with three different sliding contact surface combinations, depending on size and 
series. These sliding contact surface combinations are
• steel/PTFE sintered bronze
• steel/PTFE fabric
• steel/PTFE FRP
The sliding layers of modern materials that 
have very low friction are the same as those 
used for SKF maintenance-free spherical 
plain bearings.
Assortment
The SKF assortment comprises male or 
female rod ends with right or left-hand thread 
and also with welding shank. The latter are 
only available as steel-on-steel rod ends as 
standard. The assortment covers a pin diameter range between 5 and 200 mm.

Developing a cleaner cleaner
The electric motor and its bearings are the heart of many household appliances. 
SKF works closely with appliance manufacturers to improve their products’ performance, cut costs, reduce weight, and reduce energy consumption. A recent 
example of this cooperation is a new generation of vacuum cleaners with substantially more suction. SKF knowledge in the area of small bearing technology  
is also applied to manufacturers of power tools and office equipment.
Harnessing wind power
The growing industry of wind-generated electric power provides a source of 
clean, green electricity. SKF is working closely with global industry leaders to 
develop efficient and trouble-free turbines, providing a wide range of large, highly 
specialized bearings and condition monitoring systems to extend equipment life 
of wind farms located in even the most remote and inhospitable environments.
Working in extreme environments
In frigid winters, especially in northern countries, extreme sub-zero temperatures can cause bearings in railway axleboxes to seize due to lubrication starvation. SKF created a new family of synthetic lubricants formulated to retain their 
lubrication viscosity even at these extreme temperatures. SKF knowledge enables 
manufacturers and end user customers to overcome the performance issues 
resulting from extreme temperatures, whether hot or cold. For example, SKF 
products are at work in diverse environments such as baking ovens and instant 
freezing in food processing plants.
Maintaining a 350 km/h R&D lab
In addition to SKF’s renowned research and development facilities in Europe and 
the United States, Formula One car racing provides a unique environment for 
SKF to push the limits of bearing technology. For over 60 years, SKF products, 
engineering and knowledge have helped make Scuderia Ferrari a formidable 
force in F1 racing. (The average racing Ferrari utilizes around 150 SKF components.) Lessons learned here are applied to the products we provide to automakers and the aftermarket worldwide.
Delivering Asset Efficiency Optimization 
Through SKF Reliability Systems, SKF provides a comprehensive range of asset 
efficiency products and services, from condition monitoring hardware and software to maintenance strategies, engineering assistance and machine reliability 
programmes. To optimize efficiency and boost productivity, some industrial facilities opt for an Integrated Maintenance Solution, in which SKF delivers all services under one fixed-fee, performance-based contract.
Planning for sustainable growth 
By their very nature, bearings make a positive contribution to the natural environment, enabling machinery to operate more efficiently, consume less power, 
and require less lubrication. By raising the performance bar for our own products, SKF is enabling a new generation of high-efficiency products and equipment. With an eye to the future and the world we will leave to our children, the 
SKF Group policy on environment, health and safety, as well as the manufacturing techniques, are planned and implemented to help protect and preserve the 
earth’s limited natural resources. We remain  committed to sustainable, environmentally responsible growth.
