Non-standard small series products 
Pressing bags 
Pressing bags are rubber or rubber-textile cushion or flat-form, products. Pressing bag filling 
media are compressed air or a liquid, most often treated water. They are used to seal moulds 
during the product shaping process, for example for the automotive or ceramic industries, etc. 
The principle consists in inducing compression force in the bag using compressed air or a 
liquid, which produces the desired product shape. The bags are made from several types of 
rubber compounds according to their intended use and can be reinforced with textile fibres. 
The produced bags are up to 2.5 m wide and 13 m long. Short delivery time. 
Other pressing rubber and rubber-textile products 
Rubber-textile inflatable bags (of smaller dimensions) - suitable for repairs of car body 
dents. 
Rubber-textile inflatable sleeves - designed to shape winding in the production of electric 
motors. 
Silicon-textile flat pressing membranes -used in the production of carpets. 
Pressing bags -used in the food processing industry to press fruit, grapes, cheese, etc. 
Insulating bags 
We can make a shape and dimension 
in compliance with customer's needs with respect 
to the operation of a given particular bag. 
Insulating bags for oil transfomers are used to equalize pressure in transfomer oil tanks and

800,000 litres and supplied in a variety 
of material to suit the application.
The collapsible tanks are quick to 
deploy and can be stored using 
a minimum of space, ideal for 
environments 
where 
it 
can 
be 
difficult to establish more permanent 
solution such as steel tanks. One of 
the most challenging problems for 
fuel and water storage is the harsh 
environments where conflicts or 
relief operations may be conducted. 
Rubena flexible tanks have been 
successfully deployed from Arctic/
Antarctic to tropical and desert 
conditions.
These flexible tanks are manufactured 
from specially developed rubbercoated textiles which are specifically 
designed to offer high abrasion and 
tear resistance. Each product will 
be designed for the specific duty 
required including all types of fuels, 
liquid fertiliser and water. Rubena 
also offers a broad range of chemicalresistant flexible tanks. The units can 
withstand extremes of temperature 
and almost any environment.

tensile strength with excellent tear and 
puncture resistance.
Flexible and easily deployed
in any environment
Where there is need for temporary 
liquid storage flexible tanks can be 
deployed quickly and filled on site 
and are available with all accessories 
needed to receive and deliver the fuel 
or water to generators, vehicles and 
helicopters, etc. Once the application 
is complete they can be emptied, 
cleaned and stored for future use.
The flexible nature of the tanks allows 
large quantities of water to be stored 
and distributed safely.
Available in a range of
specifications depending
on requirements
Ranging in capacities from 1,000 up 
to 800,000 litres, Rubena flexible 
tanks are supplied in different material

DRY STORAGE
SYSTEM


Dry Storage System
The Rubena Dry Storage System can be used 
to protect a multitude of high value assets 
including military hardware, ammunition, 
emergency equipment such as generators, 
pumps and compressors, medical equipment 
and just about any high value asset that may 
be used occasionally.
This enables assets to be decentralised and 
stored where they will be required resulting 
in rapid deployment when needed.
The system has been proven in arctic, desert, 
dry and humid ambient conditions. NATO 
standard camouflage netting can also be 
incorporated.
Each Dry Storage System unit is 
supplied with a base and sealing 
rail, an inflatable sealing tube, a twoply butyl cover, protection material, 
inflation and vacuum connections, 
desiccant bags to remove any remai- 
ning moisture and sensors to connect 
a hand-held portable hygrometer. 
Depending 
upon 
the 
application, 
wooden or polymer flooring will be 
included to absorb the static weight of 
the asset being protected. The base 
is inserted inside the sealing frame 
and the flooring is positioned onto the 
base. 
The asset is positioned onto the 
base and the two-ply butyl cover is 
positioned over the asset, usually with 
some additional material to protect the 
asset, with desiccant bags positioned 
inside 
the 
cover. 
The 
humidity 
sensor(s) is supplied with a length of 
cable so that the sensor can be placed 
inside the cover to suit the application. 
The cover is then inserted inside 
the sealing rail, the inflatable seal 
is inserted into the rail and inflated, 
which then provides a seal between 
the base and the cover.
Air is then vacuumed out of the unit 
to remove humidity inside the Dry 
Storage System. This significantly 
reduces relative humidity, and the 
effect of oxidation is eliminated 
thereby protecting the asset for long 
periods of time. 
Maintenance is limited to periodic 
visual checks and humidity readings 
to ensure the Dry Storage System 
is holding the vacuum. Inadvertent 
damage to the unit can be repaired 
on-site very easily and a repair kit is 
supplied with each unit. 
Other optional accessories include a 
hand-held hygrometer, compressor/ 
vacuum pump and associated hoses, 
spare desiccant bags supplied in a 
sealed package and a specific packing 
crate to store the system when not in 
use.
Installation 
is 
simple 
and 
quick 
utilising a minimum of labour and 
once the asset is installed inside the 
Dry Storage System, it is protected 
against atmospheric degradation for 
long periods thereby extending the 
asset’s expected life.
The system has a design life in excess 
of 20 years and can be used over 
and over again leading to a versatile, 
durable and robust protection system.

Rubena low-pressure (LP) pneumatic 
fenders play an essential role in 
the safe berthing of ships at sea in 
emergency or other operations such 
as refuelling.
Unlike other fenders, Rubena LP 
fenders are designed to spread 
berthing forces over a large area, 
achieving a far lower load reaction 
and hull pressure than any other 
fender system. This makes them 
ideal for use when berthing vessels 
with single, non-metallic or weakened 
hulls.
While durable enough to stand up 
to the most hostile environments at 
sea, the LP fenders are considerably 
lighter than a high-pressure fender 
of equivalent performance, and can 
easily be transported, inflated at point 
of use and deployed in a range of 
emergency applications.
This reduces deck space to an 
absolute minimum compared with 
alternative fender types. They are 
also easy to deflate and store for later 
use which significantly reduces UV 
light and Ozone damage resulting in 
extremely long service life.
It is not unusual for Rubena fenders 
to still be in use 25 years after 
first delivery. Available in a range 
of standard sizes, they can also 
be custom made to a specific 
requirement. 
Rubena 
has 
been 
supplying LP pneumatic fenders to 
the maritime industry for decades.
Product overview


• Spreads berthing forces over the full length of the fender as opposed to a point-contact resulting in very low hull pressures
to reduce the risk of hull damage.
• Effectively and safely absorbs the kinetic energy of the moving vessel during the berthing operation.
• Lowest load reactions of any alternative fender system.
• ISO17357-2:2014 compliant with tests witnessed and reviewed by American Bureau of Shipping.
• Ideal for use with single hull, non-metallic or weakened vessels or those with sensitive electronic systems requiring
protection when berthing. Unlikely to damage vessels during unintended collisions.
• Light weight and low package size make the Rubena fenders particularly suitable for coast guard and rescue vessels where
fender requirements may not be known in advance.
• No special davits required and can be quickly and safely deployed at point of use.
Features & Benefits
Transportation
LP Fenders can easily be carried, inflated 
and deployed in a range of emergency 
applications via air, sea or land. This 
flexibility 
makes 
them 
particularly 
suited for ship-to-ship operations and 
offer a significant impact on time and 
costs of transport. As they can be 
transported and deployed quickly, the 
Rubena fenders are key to preventing 
oil spill from damaged vessels, thereby 
minimising damage to the environment.
Storage
Easy to deflate and store for later 
use. When deflated they can be rolled 
into small, lightweight packages and 
are therefore very cost effective by 
increasing deck space and reducing 
storage weight. As they operate at a 
nominal pressure of 70 mbar (1 Psi), 
any convenient air supply can be used 
for inflation. Their low inflation pressure 
also makes repairs and maintenance 
easy and safe.
Improved design
Durable and unencumbered by external 
fittings, the units can be towed while 
inflated and attachments suitable for 
towing and mooring can be provided 
at each end of the fender to provide 
flexibility of deployment. In addition, 
girthing ropes are fitted for ease of 
handling 
and 
manoeuvring 
using 
standard ship mechanical handling gear.


A high-energy absorbing capacity 
coupled with ease of handling enables 
ships of even the largest tonnage 
to be safely fendered in various 
conditions and berthing operations. 
Rubena LP pneumatic fenders have 
been 
in 
operation 
worldwide 
in 
many applications, both military and 
commercially, for many years. 
These include ship to ship transfer 
and refueling/replenishment at sea, 
offshore mooring, naval applications, 
salvage and cargo recovery, rescue 
and emergency floatation. They are 
extensively used for military operations 
at sea including mine sweeping. Many 
commercial companies specialising 
in salvage and emergency choose 
Rubena fenders to reduce risk and 
lower their operating costs. They 
feature in the operations of international 
salvage companies who specialise in 
providing a quick response to marine 
emergencies around the globe and by 
specialist shipbuilders.

Dracone Barge as an essential part of 
their oil spill response equipment. 
Available in a range of sizes up to 
1,000,000 litres, the Dracone barge is a 
flexible, towable bladder constructed 
from Hgh-performance materials 
enabling it to withstand hostila ocean 
conditions. 
had an unrivalled ecord of operational 
performance worldwide. Dracone 
barges continue to operate globally, 
providing a unique system of bulk liquid 
transport and oil spill collection and 
removal in a range of applications and 
industries. 
Originally used for military purposes for 
the bulk transportation of retined fuels, 
they have many other commercial and 
military applications 
DRAGONE BARGE 
The Dracone barges are in service with, 
amongst many others, the UK Ministry 
of Defence, the United States and 
Indian Coast Guards, the US Navy, the 
Australian Ministry of Defence and 
almost all oil companies own them. ln 
military operations, they are primarily 
used to transfer bulk volumes of fuel 
from a ship to the shore.The Dracone 
barge is simple to operate, which allows 
it to be repeatedly ferried to and from an 
oil spill containment area. 


FEATURES & BENEFITS
DRACONE BARGE
Dracone barges
• Versatile large capacity for transportation and storage of liquids
• Durable and able to withstand harsh conditions
• Suitable for fuels, oil spill collection, grey and black water
• Easily towed in open water
• Quickly deployed and air transportable
• Very long life expectancy - >20 years
Strong and reliable under harsh conditions - The Dracone barge 
is constructed from synthetic rubber-coated nylon fabric, making
it highly resistant to all weather conditions, abrasion, sunlight,
oil and sea water. 
The construction of the nose and tail moldings, based on modern 
composite technology and extensively tested under stress analysis, 
is essential to the overall strength of the unit. For use in pollution 
control, the inside has a nitrile coating that is specially designed to 
store distillate fuel oils of up to 30 % aromatic content.
Easily towed in open water - With non- inflatable buoyancy panels, 
the Dracone barge will float whether empty or full and will follow 
the exact course of the towing vessel, allowing tight maneuvers to 
be executed. Designed for towing in open seas, the unit has undergone intensive stress analysis to determine the optimal design for 
maximum stability in water.
Rapidly deployable and adaptable with a large capacity and ‘fold 
away’ flexibility the Dracone barge is an essential part of the oil 
spill first response kit. Easy to set up and quick to launch from 
a quayside, the deck of an offshore vessel, or drop launched by 
crane or helicopter with minimal lifting equipment, it can be quickly 
transported to critical areas, filled to an enormous capacity to limit 
oil spill movements, and then easily towed for safe disposal. 
Other products - Alongside the Dracone barge, Trelleborg also 
provide other essential products for pollution control: 
• Flexible pillow tanks - Primarily for use on land for the temporary storage of large quantities of fuels, water and crude oil, flexible
tanks can be manufactured to specified sizes to fit available space
on oil spill collection ships. The tanks are easily filled and once
emptied can be folded or stored away.
• Bund liners - Used in conjunction with flexible tanks they provide
a reliable containment around the tanks to prevent fuel spillage.

PRODUCT OVERWIEV
PORT SECURITY BARRIERS
Trelleborg port security barriers provide 
a proven, durable and cost effective 
solution against seaborne threats whether 
deliberate or accidental. They are available 
from 1.4 m to 2.4 m diameter, in individual 
standard lengths of 25 m or can custom 
made. They are interconnected using
marine grade shackles, quick release 
catches and/or closure plates to form 
almost any barrier length and configuration 
required. Our inflatable barriers are
manufactured from a purpose-built rubber 
coated fabric, which incorporates high 
levels of protection against abrasion, tear, 
UV and Ozone resulting in a design life 
expectancy in excess of 20 years.
These barriers have been installed to 
effectively safeguard some of the most 
sensitive global naval bases, high value 
shipping and petrochemical ports. Their 
low draft ensures that gateway systems 
are operated quickly and conveniently. The 
Trelleborg port security barriers require very 
little service and maintenance attention 
and provide continuity and integrity of 
protection throughout the life of the barrier. 
This results in the lowest through-life costs 
of any equivalent port protection barrier. 
As the main body is made of rubber coated 
fabric, there are few metal components 
which reduces maintenance and replacement costs even further. The barriers are 
sensitive to the environment and, whilst 
alternative systems can cause extensive 
risks, the Trelleborg port security barriers 
will not harm local marine life or ecology.
Each barrier system is unique and will have 
different local challenges. The Trelleborg 
technical team has decades of experience 
and provides a full design and consultancy 
service from initial concept through to 
installation. Mooring buoys and slide rails 
used to connect the individual barriers are 
manufactured by Trelleborg, our parent 
company, which results in single source 
responsibility and access to full technical 
expertise. Mooring buoy anchoring will 
be dependent upon local conditions but 
can include self-propelled anchors, drag 
anchors and concrete dead weights.
Installation can be provided by Trelleborg 
using dedicated expertise or we can
provide full supervision of local contractors.

FEATURES & BENEFITS
PORT SECURITY BARRIERS
• Minimum maintenance resulting in lowest cost of ownership.
• Rugged and durable to provide high levels of barrier system integrity.
• Imposing and highly visual deterrent.
• Tested and proven to repel determined attacks whilst causing minimal damage during accidental collisions.
• Easily installed, flexibility in configuration and suitable for seasonal deployment.
• Low draft reduces marine growth, allows simple operation of gateways and provides maximum barrier height.
• Standard diameters of 1.4, 1.8 and 2.4 m and adaptable for protection of pipelines and fixed assets from accidental collisions.
Key safety features
• Operates at low pressure for safety.
• No danger of catastrophic deflation or sudden release of stored energy if accidentally punctured.
• An individual barrier will slowly deflate to 50% of its diameter to enable the barrier system maintains its integrity.
• Resistant to small arms fire.
• The rubber body construction will not damage passing vessels which may accidentally contact the barrier.
• The barrier ‘softness’ will cause no harm to public or their craft hitting the barrier by accident.
• Ecologically sensitive and will not harm marine life.
Designed for high impact 
The primary function is to prevent or delay an attacking vessel
entering restricted area thereby providing time for secondary
security measures to be deployed. Inherently flexible, the portable 
units are lightweight and easy to inflate or deflate and transport. 
This design makes them highly versatile with set lengths easily 
coupled together to configure to many different port layouts, 
providing a distinct advantage over heavier fixed or fencing based 
barrier systems that require more complex and costly operations to 
transport and install.
Easily maneuvered in water, they are shackled together using 
standard buoys and anchor systems at predetermined intervals 
and can be linked in any configuration and practically any length.
A series of units operates as a simple gate system to provide 
authorized access into and out of the secured zone. The space 
between connecting buoys is dependent on geography, climate
and tides and is adaptable to virtually any naval or commercial
port location.


APPLICATIONS
PORT SECURITY BARRIERS
Rubena port security barriers are protecting high
value marine assets in many ports globally.
Whilst suitable for any port, the rubber coated fabric construction 
makes them the preferred choice for submarine bases or where 
there is a high level of public and commercial traffic.
As they are easily and quickly inflated and deflated, they can be used 
for seasonal deployment or when security threat levels are elevated. 
A simple, lower cost demarcation barrier of 0.5 or 1 m diameter is 
available where port vessel movement control is required such as 
around piers and pipeline jetties.
With an unrivalled versatility in design and installation, the barriers 
can easily be adapted to any port situation, naval or commercial in 
addition to the protection of sensitive land-based assets that may be 
vulnerable to sea attack, such as coastal power plants, desalination 
plants and petrochemical installations.
They can be used to provide temporary or short term protection for 
visiting dignitaries or high value military assets in repair shipyards 
The port security barriers have been deployed in numerous Olympic 
Games venues.
In addition to their extensive use at military sites, The Rubena port 
security barrier has been adapted to provide protection of fixed 
assets such as fuel pipeline.
For example, 2 barriers are installed at Changi airport to protect the 
main fuel lines jetty from accidental collision by the first response.
