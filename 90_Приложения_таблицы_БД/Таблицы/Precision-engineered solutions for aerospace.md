RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings
RBC thin section ball bearings are engineered to solve a
variety of design problems that cannot be solved with
conventional ball bearings.
A bearing is considered a thin section when the bore
diameter is greater than four times the radial cross section.
Within any thin section ball bearing series, the cross section
remains constant as the bore diameter changes. Typically
the cross section is twice the ball diameter, and nominal
dimensions are given in inches.
Some advantages of RBC thin section ball bearings are:
• Light weight
• Multi-load capabilities
• High stiffness
• Variety of cross sections & sizes
• Small cross section
• Modified & custom bearings
RBC thin section ball bearings are most often found where
space limitations, combined loading, and weight restrictions
pose unique design requirements.
RBC also designs and manufactures special thin section
ball bearings tailored for speciﬁc applications.

Teﬂon® is a registered trademark of DuPont.
Armalon® is a registered trademark of INDACO.
Many molded seals used in bearings are made out of
nitrile (molded rubber per MIL-R-6855). The material has
a relatively high coefﬁcient of friction. In order to meet
low torque bearing requirements, seal ﬁt-up during
installation must be adjusted to minimize contact
pressure on the sealing surfaces - reducing torque by
reducing sealing effectiveness. The inherent variability in
the seal molding process can further aggravate these
issues. Over time, torque ﬂuctuations are nearly
inevitable sInce seals may reset or the amount of lube
between the seal and the sealing surface may change.
Based on these performance characteristics, molded
seals are often marginal and unreliable solutions for
torque sensitive applications. 
RBC’s solution is a combination seal-shield design. The
seal is made from either pure PTFE (Teﬂon®) or glass
ﬁber reinforced PTFE (Armalon®). PTFE is chemically
inert, has a very low coefﬁcient of friction (inherent
lubricity), and provides the widest operating temperature
range of any sealing material. The seal is held in place
and shielded with a stainless steel (300 series) ﬂat ring.
The seal drag torque in this design is minimal,
predictable, and consistent over time. RBC invariably
recommends this design for aIl low torque or torque
sensitive applications that require sealing. RBC can
readily retroﬁt problematic molded seal designs with 
a PTFE/300SS optImized solution. For versions that
cannot allow a seal, we offer a shield in its place.

The limit load ratings shown apply only to Airframe Control position where bearings are used for oscillatory service.
Note: These bearings should not be used as track rollers, cam follower rolls, and the like.
Equivalent Radial Load = .52 x Radial Load + 1.91 x Thrust Load or = Radial Load, whichever is greater.
Pure Thrust Rating = .84 Radial Rating at operating speed.
(2)These ratings are for single bearings.
(3)Heavy line indicates limiting speeds recommended for sealed bearings; for higher speeds, seals should be removed.

THERMAL-COMP™BEARINGS
Y-PWI
SERIES
THERMAL-COMP™Bearings are custom designed to
compensate for adverse effects of temperature extremes 
on bearing performance in airborne applications.
THERMAL-COMP™Bearings have a double-split rings
design and once properly installed in bearing support
structure at ambient temperature, they will maintain steady
and predictable stiffness and torque characteristics
throughout a temperature range, regardless of differences 
in coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the bearing and
the support structure materials. 
In most airborne systems, large azimuth bearings are
installed in support structures (shaft and housing), which
have to be made from light aluminum alloys in order to
control weight. While conventional bearings may be
installed and ﬁtted for optimum stiffness and rotational
torque at ambient temperature, signiﬁcant variations in
bearing performance will be experienced at extremes of
temperature in actual application. Such variations are
caused by differences in CTE of bearing materials
(hardened steels) and the aluminum alloys used for the
support structure. At one temperature extreme, the bearing
will be internally over-loaded to a much higher stiffness and
rolling friction torque; yet at another extreme, the bearing
internal preload may be compromised resulting in loss of
stiffness or excessive deﬂection. Such undesirable
variations in conventional bearing performance at extremes
of temperature will have to be carefully analyzed and
consequences mitigated, often necessitating utilization of
larger drive motors and/or using more expensive support
structure alloys with CTE properties as close to bearing
steel as possible. With THERMAL-COMP™Bearings
such uncertainties in performance are greatly reduced.
The following is a typical illustration of THERMAL-COMP™
Bearings manufactured at RBC-Industrial Tectonics
Bearings. Note that the free-state gap in ring split is
determined based on bearing size and application
temperatures involved. The gap will be closed to near zero
when the bearing is operating at the coldest temperature in
the application. The gap will be slightly wider when bearing
is operating at higher temperatures. However, bearing
performance will remain consistent.

THIN SECTION BALL BEARING ENGINEERING DATA
The methods, equations, and technical data presented
in this section allow the user to select the correct
bearings and estimate their performance for a wide
range of applications. For applications with severe or
unusual operating conditions, RBC is prepared to
provide an in-depth analysis and recommend the most
suitable bearing arrangement. 
Where standard bearings cannot be used, RBC can
meet the application requirements with a special bearing
design speciﬁcally tailored for optimum performance.
Contact your RBC Sales Engineer for special sizes,
materials, application requirements, dimensions and
tolerances.
Capacity and Fatigue Life 
of Ball Bearings 
The BASIC DYNAMIC RADIAL LOAD RATING, C, or
“dynamic capacity”, for a ball bearing is the calculated,
constant radial load at which 90% of a group of
apparently identical bearings with stationary outer rings
can statistically endure 106 revolution of the inner ring.
ANSI/ABMA Standard 9 with correction factors for race
curvatures was used to calculate the catalog ratings.
The DYNAMIC THRUST and DYNAMIC MOMENT LOAD
RATINGS are also shown in the product tables. The
ratings shown are a guide for the maximum loads under
which these bearings should be operated with either
pure thrust or pure moment loading. Thrust ratings are
2.5 to 3.0 times the radial ratings depending on the
bearing type and cross section. These load ratings are
not additive. For combined radial and thrust loads, an
equivalent radial load is to be calculated. 
The BASIC STATIC LOAD RATING, Co, or “static
capacity”, is that uniformly distributed load, which
produces a maximum theoretical contact stress of
609,000 psi. At this contact stress permanent
deformation of ball and raceway occurs. This
deformation is approximately .0001% of the ball
diameter.

n = number of balls
d = diameter of balls (in.)
The RATING LIFE, L10, is a statistical measure of the life
which 90% of a large group of apparently identical ball
bearings will achieve or exceed. For a single bearing,
L10 also refers to the life associated with 90% reliability.
Median Life, L50, is the life which 50% of the group of
ball bearings will achieve or exceed. Median life is
approximately ﬁve times the rating life. 
The relationship between rating life, load rating, and
load is: 
L10 = (C/P)3 with L10 = rating life (106 rev) 
C = basic dynamic radial load rating (lbf) 
P = equivalent radial load (lbf)
To obtain the rating life in hours, use: 
L10 hrs = 16667/N * (C/P)3 with N = speed (rpm) 
The Equivalent Radial Load is deﬁned as:
P = XFr + YFa
with 
Fr = radial load (lbf) 
Fa = axial load (lbf) 
X - see below 
Y - see below 
Radial Contact Bearing Calculations 
For radial contact bearings calculate P with X = 1 
and Y = 0. Then recalculate P with X = 0.56 and 
Y = (see chart below). Use the larger value of P to
determine L10 life.


129
Angular or 4-Point Contact Bearing
Calculations 
For angular contact and 4-point contact bearings
calculate P with X = 1.0 and Y = 0. Then recalculate P
with X = 0.39 and Y = 0.76. Use the larger value of P to
determine L10 life. 
The equations are valid in the range of approximately
100 hrs to 100,000 hrs of life. Extreme loads or speeds
may result in a shorter life; while in less demanding
applications, metal fatigue may never affect bearing
service life. 
Capacity and fatigue life information is based on ANSI/ABMA Standard 9-1990
published by: The American Bearing Manufacturers Association, Inc., 1200
19th Street, NW, Suite 300, Washington, DC 20036-2401 
Adjustment Factors for Rating Life 
If a bearing design and operation deviates signiﬁcantly
from normal, it may be necessary to use additional
factors to estimate the fatigue life Ln.
Ln = a1 * a2 * a3 * L10 hrs
with 
a1 = reliability factor 
a2 = material & processing factor 
a3 = application factor 
Reliability Factor a1
Reliability is the percentage of a group of apparently
identical ball bearings that is expected to attain or
exceed a speciﬁed life. For an individual bearing it is 
the probability that the bearing will attain or exceed a
speciﬁed life. Typical bearing fatigue life is calculated for
90% reliability. The life adjustment factors for other
reliability numbers are shown below.

Material Factor a2
For standard bearings the material factor a2 is equal to
1.00. Factor a2 is determined by material processing,
forming methods, heat treatment, and other
manufacturing methods. Some commonly used material
factors are listed below: 
Application Factor a3
The application factor a3 is equal to 1.0 for most
applications. Unusual or extreme conditions in certain
applications such as low speed, shock loading,
vibration, and extreme temperature may lower the
application factor to 0.50. Contact your RBC Sales
Engineer for help in determining this factor for your
special applications. 
Load and Speed Limitations 
The load ratings shown in the product tables are not
additive. For combined simultaneous loading, an
equivalent radial or thrust load must be considered. In
general, C-Type bearings are designed for radial loading
applications; moderate thrust and/or moment loading
may be applied in combination with radial loading. For
thrust loading applications use the A-Type bearing; any
radial loading should only be applied in combination
with thrust loading. X-Type bearings are primarily for
reversing thrust and moment loading, pure radial loading
should not be applied. 
The limiting speeds shown in the product tables are
based on standard lubrication. The unsealed bearing
speeds are calculated assuming the bearings are
lubricated with MIL-PRF-6085. Limiting speeds for
sealed bearings are calculated assuming the bearings
are lubricated with MIL-PRF-23827 grease. If bearings
are lubricated with alternate oils or greases, new limiting
speeds must be calculated, see page 113.

OPERATING CONDITIONS
Lubrication
Lubricants serve a number of very important purposes
in ball bearings, including:
• protecting bearing surfaces from corrosion
• reducing rolling and sliding friction
• preventing metal-to-metal contact between balls and
raceway
• providing a barrier against external contaminants
(grease)
• removing heat (oil)
Lack of lubrication or inadequate lubrication is the most
common cause of bearing failure. 
Standard RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings are lubricated
with either oil or grease. The unsealed bearings, the K
series, are thoroughly coated in MIL-PRF-3150 or MILPRF-6085 oil and drained of excess. Sealed bearings
are lubricated with MIL-PRF-23827 grease. The external
surfaces of sealed bearings are lightly coated with the
same grease for corrosion resistance. Additional
lubricants are also available. Your RBC Sales Engineer
can help select the appropriate lubricant for special
applications. 
Temperature 
Standard RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings can operate at
temperatures from -65°F to 250°F. Temperatures up to
350°F can be reached if the bearings are temperature
stabilized. By the use of special materials RBC can
provide bearings for operation to 900°F. Contact your
RBC Sales Engineer for recommendations on bearings
operating above 250°F. 
Limiting Speed 
The limiting speed of a bearing is dependent upon a
number of different factors including bearing size,
bearing type, ball separator design, lubrication and
loading. The limiting speeds for the bearings shown in
this catalog are determined using the following: 
N = 
with N = Speed (RPM) 
E = 
(Bearing Pitch Diameter) 
k = constant, see table below 
D+B
1000 * k 
E
The k values shown give the maximum speeds at which
a typical thin section ball bearing can operate. It is
recommended that operating speeds of large diameter
bearings in a given series be reduced up to 40% of the
calculated rating to avoid high bearing temperatures. 
Speed ratings can also be impacted by load conditions,
lubrication, alignment and ambient temperature. All of
these factors must be considered when designing thin
section ball bearings into your application. 
DUPLEX PAIRS AND AXIAL PRELOADING 
Duplex Pairs 
Duplex bearings are a pair of angular contact RBC Thin
Section Ball Bearings specially ground for use as a
matched set. A duplexed pair can be used to provide
accurate shaft location, to increase capacity or to
increase stiffness of the bearing assembly. A duplex pair
of RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings is ground so that
when mounted using recommended ﬁts, there will be no
internal clearance in the bearings. There are three basic
mounting methods to accommodate different loading
requirements: 
• Back-to-Back (DB), B-Type 
• Face-to-Face (DF), F-Type 
• Tandem (DT), T-Type

Radial play (diametral clearance) is the distance the inner
ring can be moved radially from one extreme position to the
other. Standard RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings are
manufactured with enough radial play that some clearance
remains after the bearing is properly installed. 
When there is negative radial play (diametral preload)
there is interference rather than clearance between the
balls and the races. As the interference increases, the
friction, stiffness and torque also increase. RBC Thin
Section Ball Bearings can be manufactured with
customer speciﬁed diametral preload or clearance.
Consult your RBC Sales Engineer for design assistance. 
Radial and Axial Runout 
Radial runout of RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings is a
measurement of the thickness variation of the bearing
rings. The outer ring is measured from the ball path to the
outer diameter of the ring, the inner ring is measured from
the ball path to the bore. Radial runout is deﬁned as the
wall thickness variation of the rotating ring. 
Axial runout is measured from the ball path to the face
of the bearing rings. The variation in thickness measured
is the axial runout. 
TOLERANCES 
Precision Grades 
RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings are available in four 
precision grades. RBC Precision classes 0, 3, 4 and 6 
correspond to ABMA ABEC grades 1F, 3F, 5F and 7F
respectively. The tolerances for the bearing bores, outer
diameters, radial runouts, axial runouts and radial plays are
shown in the Tolerance Tables on pages 108 through 110.
Shaft and Housing Fits 
Proper shaft and housing ﬁts are critical to the successful operation of a thin section ball bearing. The internal
clearance of the bearing will be reduced proportionally
by an interference ﬁt. In addition, the roundness of the
shaft and housing will directly affect the roundness of
the inner and outer ring raceways. For most applications
the inner ring is rotating and the load is stationary with
respect to the outer ring. In this circumstance a light
press ﬁt onto the shaft is recommended. The recommended shaft and housing ﬁts are shown in the
Tolerance Tables on pages 108 through 110.
Axial Preloading
Standard duplex bearings are ground so that there will
be a light axial preload induced on the bearing at
nominal conditions. In some applications increased
bearing stiffness may be required. In these cases the
duplex grinding can be done such that a heavier axial
load is induced in the mounted bearing. This load can
be increased or decreased to meet the requirements of
a particular application. Consult your RBC Sales
Engineer for special requirements.

MOUNTING ARRANGEMENTS
When selecting a mounting arrangement for RBC Thin
Section Ball Bearings, you must ﬁrst consider the
loading condition. A duplex pair of angular contact
bearings may be used for combined loading, moment
loading, or heavy thrust loading. Combination A and 
C-Type, A and X-Type, or C and X-Type bearings are
common mounting arrangements. Two X-Type bearings
should never be mounted on the same shaft. There may
be many different bearing arrangements for carrying the
same load, some typical mounting arrangements are
shown below. 
Reversing Loads 
The duplex pair of A-Type bearings offers several
conﬁgurations. For reversing loads, either Back-to-Back,
B-Type, or Face-to-Face, F-Type, should be used. The 
F-Type mounting method demonstrates reversing thrust
load. Combined radial and thrust loads are shown on
the B-Type conﬁguration. Both of these methods can be
used for heavy radial loads, combined thrust and radial
loads, or moment loads. 
Heavy Radial Loads 
The C-Type bearing is designed primarily for heavy radial loads. Two bearings can be installed on the same
shaft as shown. By axially ﬁxing one bearing and allowing the other to ﬂoat, this conﬁguration allows differential expansion between the housing and shaft, such as
caused by temperature difference, without adding axial
stress to the bearings. Although the C-Type bearing is
designed for radial loads, they can withstand moderate
thrust, moment and reversing loads.

Heavy Combined Loading
For heavy combined loading other special mounting
arrangements may be employed. As shown in the top
drawing, a duplex pair of A-Type bearings can be used
with a ﬂoating C-Type bearing. In this conﬁguration the
A-Type bearings will carry the thrust load and part of the
radial load while the C-Type carries only radial load. An
X-Type bearing can replace the duplex pair of A-Type
bearings to carry lower thrust loads as shown in the
second drawing.

CUSTOM FEATURES
RBC manufactures many custom bearings designed to
optimize bearing performance for speciﬁc applications.
Special features include changes in radial play, lubricants,
materials, preloading and design. Contact your RBC
Sales Engineer for your custom bearing needs. 
Challenge us: There are many design options available
to solve difﬁcult application problems. 
Materials 
The standard bearings shown in the catalog have SAE
52100 steel rings and balls. RBC Thin Section Ball
Bearings can be manufactured from other specialty
bearing steels to provide corrosion resistance, high
temperature capability, alternative load capacity or
chemical compatibility. 
Rings. RBC has manufactured thin section ball bearings
from SAE 440C stainless steel to provide corrosion
resistance. As an alternative to stainless steel rings, the
entire surface of the rings can be coated with nodular thin
dense chrome (TDC). This coating, which meets AMS
2438, achieves a molecular bond that will not ﬂake, peel
or separate from the base material. The TDC coat has a
hardness of HRC 70 - 78 and can withstand temperatures
well beyond the range of the base material. 
Special RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings have been
manufactured from Aluminum, 300 Series Stainless
Steel, 17-4 Stainless Steel, and other metals. 
Balls. Some special ball materials available include
440C Stainless Steel, 300 Series Stainless Steel, Silicon
Nitride and M-50 Steel. 
Lubrication 
Many different lubricants are available from RBC for
special applications. Greases which are designed
speciﬁcally for high speed, low torque, water resistance,
high temperature, oscillatory motion and food machinery
can be provided. Additional lubricants, such as dry ﬁlm,
are suitable for use in vacuums and space applications. 
Sealing 
Standard seals for thin section ball bearings are molded
from elastomers. Polytetraﬂouroethylene (PTFE) seals,
ﬁber glass reinforced PTFE seals, stainless steel shields
and many other options are available for low torque and
other special applications. 
The radial play (diametral clearance) of a thin section ball
bearing will need to be predetermined if mounting ﬁts
other than those recommended are used. Special radial
play may be required for a temperature differential across
the bearing, for housing and shaft materials that have
different coefﬁcients of thermal expansion, or to change
operating characteristics of the bearing. Radial
preloaded bearings are measured to meet bore and O.D.
tolerances prior to preload. 
Preloading of Duplex Bearings 
Standard duplex bearings are ground so that there will
be a light axial preload induced on the bearing at
nominal conditions. In some applications increased
bearing stiffness may be required. In these cases the
duplex grinding can be done such that a heavier axial
load is induced in the mounted bearing. This load can be
increased or decreased to meet the requirements of a
particular application. Consult your RBC Sales Engineer
for special requirements. 
Mounting Features 
Mounting features, such as ﬂanges, anti-rotation tabs
and mounting holes can be incorporated on the inner
and outer rings. Mating parts, such as gears and
housings, may be integrated into the bearing rings for
improved performance and cost. 


Separators
Standard RBC Thin Section Ball Bearings, KA through
KG and JU series, are manufactured with brass or nylon
separators. The KAA series contains nylon separators.
The A-Type bearings contain one piece circular pocket
separators, while the C- and X-Types have snap-over
separators. The four basic separator materials are brass,
nylon, phenolic and stainless steel. 
The graph below schematically illustrates the effects of
cage design and material on bearing performance. For
example, the one piece circular pocket design may reach
roughly two times the speed of the snap-over design.
Likewise, a brass separator design will generate more
torque and withstand higher temperatures than a
phenolic separator. Exact speed limits depend on
bearing size, bearing type, lubrication and loading.
Speciﬁc material advantages and limitations are
illustrated below. For assistance in selecting the
appropriate separator for special applications, contact
your RBC Sales Engineer.

For use in an aerial camera assembly, an extra-light, low
torque bearing was required. By redesigning a standard
RBC Thin Section Ball Bearing 4-point contact design, the
overall as sem bly weight was lowered from 7 lbs. to 3.8 lbs.
In addition to weight reduction, this design, also reduced
the running torque below 1 in.-lbs. with the starting torque
below 2 in.-lbs.
Airborne Radar System
A duplex pair of angular contact RBC Thin Section Ball
Bearings was designed for an airborne radar system. This
bearing application required combined load carrying 
ca pa bil i ties, low temperature compatibility, and relatively
low torque. Different from a standard Thin Section, this
duplex bearing was designed with one outer ring and two
inner rings with a slight preload. This design provided low
torque and multiple loading capabilities.

special balls to absorb shock and vibration loading.
This bearing performed at 25% of the torque of the steel

this ap pli ca tion the bearing oscillates to ±10°, this bearing
was designed as a 4-point contact bearing.

An RBC Thin Section Ball Bearing designed with a gear
integrated with the inner ring, achieved both a sig niﬁ cant

drive which has limited space available for its support
bearing. Coil springs were used as spacers be tween balls
to lower bearing torque and further reduce weight.
Instrument Gimbal Assembly
A preloaded duplex pair of angular contact RBC Thin

INTEGRAL BEARING 
ASSEMBLY
EXTREME ANGULAR 
ACCURACY BEARINGS
To provide a set of bearings which maintain an extreme
precise angular accuracy of the center line of the shaft to
the housing. The angular accuracy requirement was a nonrepeatable error (∆a) of one arc second, and a repeatable
error (a) of three arc seconds.
Bearings should be made to the most precise geometric
tolerances possible. The bearings should be preloaded to
overcome the minor surface imperfections of the balls and
raceways. They should also be part of a cartridge
incorporating the housing and shaft.
Bearings were made as part of the cartridge assembly and
all angular measurements for accuracy were made relative
to the housing and shaft. Bearings were preloaded and
spaced axially to help overcome geometric inaccuracies of
the bearing. The bearing raceways and balls were made
from Consumable Electrode Vacuum Melted AISI 440-C
material. As the bearings had to operate in a vacuum, the
separator material necessitated a special open weave
phenolic material impregnated with a special silicone oil. 
To prevent migration of the oil from the cartridge assembly,
the labyrinth seal was coated with a barrier ﬁlm.
Save space and weight in an application involving a power
take-off drive from a high speed gearbox.
Make the races of the bearing integral with the housing
and possibly with the gear shaft.
The bearing housing was designed to incorporate the outer
raceway of the roller bearing and the outer raceway of the
split inner race ball bearing. In order to increase the reliability of the rolling contact surfaces in the housing, the
housing was manufactured from AISI M-50 material
Consumable Electrode Vacuum Melted. The gear was
made integral with the shaft which also contained the inner
raceway of the roller bearing. The gear shaft was manufactured from Consumable Electrode Vacuum Melted AISI9310 material; case hardened to Rc 61-64 on the gear
tooth surface and in the roller bearing raceway. In order to
facilitate lubrication of the bearings in the restricted area,
lubrication holes were drilled through the housing into the
space between the two bearings. The lubrication was fed
through these holes from an annular groove in the housing.
The two halves of the split inner race were retained to the
gear shaft by the use of a lock nut, clamping the races axially. The combined integral assembly of bearings, gear
shaft and housing provided the desired space and weight
reduction and gained improved operational accuracy. In

GEARED BEARING
ROLLER, THRUST AND ANGULAR
CONTACT BALL BEARING
A radar antenna drive had only limited space available for
its support bearings.
Use a thin section rather than a standard section radial ball
bearing, thus achieving a signiﬁcant weight reduction.
Incorporate a gear as part of the inner ring to obtain
improved accuracy and simplify the assembly.
The thin section bearing utilizes coil springs as spacers
between the balls instead of a conventional separator to
further reduce weight and lower bearing torque. The inner
race of the bearing was extended and the gear was cut on
this extended portion of the inner race. The incorporation
of the gear into the inner race eliminated the necessity of a
shaft clamping mechanism, etc., which would be required
if the gear were separate from the bearing. Integrating the
gear proﬁle into the inner race increased the accuracy of
the gear to bearing concentricity. The bearing was
manufactured of the following materials: the balls and
outer race are from AISI-440-material; the inner race
manufactured from AIS1-8620 material, carburized and
hardened in the raceway area to Rc 58-60.
Cost reduction of an existing hydraulic pump swash plate
assembly.
Utilize an integral bearing assembly which combines a
roller thrust bearing and an angular contact ball bearing.
The original swash plate design in the hydraulic pump
utilized a roller thrust bearing to handle the thrust load and
a separate angular contact radial ball bearing to handle
radial loads; and radially locate the swash plate assembly.
The usage of two separate bearings required complex
machining of the housing and swash plate with close
control of tolerances, to eliminate excessive radial
eccentricity of the swash plate assembly. In the original
design, which utilized two separate bearings, it was
necessary to mount the bearings axially adjacent to each
other. The recommended bearing design decreased the
axial space required for bearings, resulting in a size and
weight savings. A combined bearing assembly is usually
lower in cost than two separate bearings. The technique of
integrating two bearings usually simpliﬁes an assembly
where two bearings had been utilized, or where problems
have arisen relative to running accuracy, overall size or
weight.

SELF-ALIGNING BEARING
OPERATING IN LIQUID
POLYETHYLENE
SENBAL 
BEARING
A rolling contact bearing was required on a vertical shaft
which rotated in a catalytic-polyethylene autoclave. Blind
assembly of the bearing and shaft which weighed
approximately 10,000 pounds was necessary, due to the
autoclave design.
Use radial ball bearing incorporating a self-aligning
raceway made from corrosion resistant materials. The
bearings should be capable of withstanding operating
temperatures as high as 650°F, and capable of operating
with liquid polyethylene as the lubricant.
The bearing was manufactured from AISI-440-C material,
specially heat treated to resist softening at the high
operating temperatures. The separator material was L-605
cobalt alloy which offered the necessary wear resistance.
To solve the client’s problem of inserting the eighteen foot
long assembly into a blind housing, a large lead-in chamfer
was formed on the outside of the bearing. This lead-in
chamfer provided for easy insertion of the bearing into the
housing.
The previous bearing installation did not allow any shaft
misalignment, resulting in bent shafts which were then
unacceptable for further use. The self-aligning feature of
the outer raceway permitted the bearing to misalign while
rotating, allowing for shaft distortion as the shaft went
through critical speeds.
A ﬂuidic gyroscope required a gimballing, self-aligning
bearing which would rotate at high speed. The bore of the
bearing was to form part of the ﬂuidic metering and
sensing system.
Use a double row, self-aligning spherical ball bearing with
spherical outer and inner raceways. The two rows of balls
should be preloaded to obtain the running accuracy
needed for the ﬂuidic metering system in the bore of the
bearing.
The double row spherical self-aligning ball bearing was
designed with a removable portion of the spherical outer
raceway to allow for preloading of the two rows of balls.
With the possibility of different rotational speeds of the two
rows of balls, each row of balls had its own separator. To
guide the separators, a special conﬁguration was
machined on the outside of the separator to allow for each
separator to be guided at two points of contact with the
spherical outer raceway.
The ﬂuidic metering portion was made as a separate unit,
press ﬁtted into the bore of the bearing.

GEARBOX BEARINGS WITH SELF
LUBRICATING SEPARATORS
A high temperature rolling contact, oscillating bearing for
operation at 1200°F, subjected to high vibration loads.
Design a rolling contact bearing with radial preload to
overcome false brinelling which may occur in the high
vibration environment. Bearings should be made from a
corrosion resistant, high-temperature alloy.
The bearing was manufactured of Stellite® 6B material
which was cold worked by an RBC proprietary process to
obtain a hardness of Rockwell C-53 minimum in the
raceway areas. The balls of this bearing were made from
L-605 cobalt alloy. The bearing was of full complement
design with a ﬁlling slot for insertion of the balls, and
negative radial clearance of line to line to .0003" tight.
The lubricating ﬁlm which is generated by the cobalt alloy
races and balls permitted this bearing to operate without
any additional lubricant. The increased hardness of the
raceways to Rockwell C-53 minimum produced a bearing
which was capable of operating up to 1200°F with extreme
wear resistance.
Bearings were needed for operation in high-temperature
gearboxes at 600°F to 650°F. Conventional lubrication
such as oil was not available, therefore the bearings would
have to be self-lubricating. 
Use bearings of high-temperature, heat treated AISI-440-C
material. Incorporate in these bearings RBC developed
proprietary graphitic carbon separators, to act as the
bearing lubricant.
Angular contact ball bearings were designed, utilizing an
inner land guided separator of graphitic carbon material.
The separator was reinforced on its outside diameter with
a metallic shroud to withstand the centrifugal forces from
high operating speeds and resist fracturing, which could
result from the tremendous acceleration rate of the bearing
rotation.
To facilitate a break-in period required for transfer of the
self-lubricating material from the graphitic carbon
separator to the rolling contact surfaces, the balls and
raceways were coated with an impinged, tungstendisulﬁde dry-ﬁlm lubricant of approximately .000020" in
thickness. With the dry ﬁlm lubricant on the raceways and
balls, the bearings were capable of operating at the
required speed without any break-in period normally
required for bearings incorporating dry, self-lubricating
separators.

NON-MAGNETIC BEARING
HIGH TEMPERATURE, ACTUATOR
THRUST BEARINGS
A high temperature thrust bearing was needed to support
the reactive thrust of a ball screw actuator. Bearings had to
be capable of operating at approximately 850°F.
Use bearings of high temperature tool steel to withstand
the applied loads at the high operating temperature.
Bearings were manufactured from CEVM M-2 tool steel
with a full complement of sixteen .187 diameter tungsten
carbide balls. The bearing was designed having a contact
angle of 60° to handle the high thrust load and some radial
loading.
The races were coated with a proprietary dry-ﬁlm lubricant
applied to the raceways of the bearings prior to installation
of the bearing in the application.
The signiﬁcant design feature which allows the bearings to
operate at 850°F and at speeds up to 750 RPM without
excessive wear is the combination of the tungsten carbide
balls running against the M-2 tool steel raceways. Similar
designs using M-2 tool steel balls had worn very rapidly at
relatively short periods of application at the operating
temperatures.
A newly designed rotating magnetometer for ore analysis
required a non-magnetic bearing. 
Use a bearing with the raceways and balls made of a
material which would be capable of operating under the
loads and possess the lowest magnetic permeability. The
loading combined thrust, radial and moment loads which
required a duplex pair of bearings.
Manufactured the bearing from Berylco 25 material. This
material was used for the inner and outer races, balls and
shields. The separator was manufactured of a phenolic
material.
The bearing was designed as a common outer duplex DB
pair, lightly preloaded. To reduce contamination possibility,
shields were incorporated. The bearing was lubricated by
grease plating the raceways with MIL-PRF-23827 lubricant.

A hinge bearing on the exhaust ducts of a jet engine used
to propel and lift a ground effect vehicle machine. 
Use a double row angular contact ball bearing in 
a self-aligning housing. Bearing materials to be made 
of corrosion and heat resistant material. 
The double row ball bearing cartridge unit utilizes 
L-605 material for the raceway and balls. The bearing 
was mounted in a self-contained spherical housing to
compensate for misalignment of the shaft during operation,
which occurs due to temperature differentials between the
frame and the exhaust nozzles.
The races were made by a special RBC developed
proprietary race hardening technique.
With this technique the L-605 cobalt alloy material is work
hardened and then heat treated to a Rockwell C-53
minimum.
The bearing operated for 50 hours with 1400°F exhaust
gas passing through the bearing without any signiﬁcant
wear.
A manufacturer of commercial aircraft required a landing
gear support trunion bearing.
Bearing must have low radial and axial clearances. 
Use a metal-to-metal spherical plain bearing. It should
have a dry ﬁlm lubricant on its spherical bearing surfaces.
The bearing should be fabricated from corrosion resistant
material.
With the clearances required, .0010/.0030 radial and .009
max. axial, assembly of match ground components was
necessary. Swaging a bearing of this size would not result
in reliable clearance control. The outer race was
assembled to the ball by deforming it under radial pressure
to an elliptical shape to allow the insertion of the ball. Once
the ball is inserted, the pressure is removed from the outer
race, allowing it to return to its original shape.

CHEMICAL PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT BEARINGS
FOOD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT
BEARINGS
Relatively short life was obtained on bearings made 
of 316 stainless steel in food processing equipment. 
316 stainless steel was required to prevent contamination
of the food products.
Use a harder, more wear resistant material which would
still be resistant to the corrosive ﬂuids of the processed
food and prevent contamination.
A search of various materials which were resistant 
to the food products handled by this particular piece of
equipment brought to light that certain cobalt alloys could
be used without any fear of contamination or corrosion.
In order to increase the wear resistance of the cobalt
alloys, they were cold worked in the raceways to increase
the hardness and thereby increase the wear resistance.
The alloy used for the raceways and the balls was 
L-605. Separator material was 17-4 PH.
Bearings exposed to photographic-processing chemical
solutions were failing. Bearings being used were made of
AISI-440-C material, sealed, and grease lubricated. 
Use a bearing of a different alloy; make the separator selflubricating and run the bearing in the chemical solutions. 
The bearing used cobalt alloy balls and races and a selflubricating separator of Fiberglass reinforced TFE. To give
additional strength to the riveted separator in this bearing,
side plates of 300 series stainless steel were added to the
separator.

High speed ball and roller bearings for use in cryogenic
equipment. Bearings should also operate in cryogenic
liquid or gaseous environment. 
Use bearings of a corrosion resistant material such as
AISI-440-C and incorporate a self-lubricating material for
the separators. 
Ball and roller bearings of ABEC-5 tolerance grade were
made of AISI-440-C material, with special sub-zero
treatment in liquid nitrogen. This sub-zero treatment gave
the bearings the dimensional stability necessary for
operating in cryogenic equipment.
The bearing separators were made of Teﬂon® reinforced
Fiberglass.
This basic bearing design criterion has been used in
almost all liquid hydrogen and oxygen turbo pumps used
in present day rocket engines.
Teﬂon® is a registered trademark of DuPont.
Mainshaft bearing for a vertical lift engine. For weight
reduction, the bearing should be self-lubricating to
eliminate a portion of the engine lubricating system.
Speed of the 85mm bore bearing was 16,000 RPM. The
bearing, located in turbine end of the jet engine,
accommodates axial shaft expansion. 
Use a ball bearing with races and balls made from wearresistant materials. Lubricate the bearing with a shrouded
self-lubricating graphite separator. Make the inner race
cylindrical to accommodate the axial shaft expansion.
Bearing was manufactured from CEVM AISI-M50 material
for the races and balls.
The separator of shrouded graphite was outer land guided
on two graphite rings, pressed into the outer race ring.
To prevent damage to the graphite while inserting the shaft
into the bearing, a side plate was added which prevented
any accidental contact of the shaft with the graphite
separator. To allow for the excess graphite to purge from
the bearing, holes were put in the protective side plate.


BALL BEARINGS 
FOR VACUUM OPERATION
NUCLEAR REACTOR BEARING
Bearing to accommodate the thrust load in a control rod
drive mechanism. Bearing is lubricated with chemically
pure water, de-ionized and de-oxygenated. 
Use a double row ball bearing, tandem ground for thrust
sharing to obtain the life required. Because radial support
of the inner race is marginal, the inner race for both rows
should be ground on the same ring.
The double row ball bearing was made of cobalt alloy
materials, the separator of 17-4 PH.
To obtain the maximum capacity in this double gothic arch
thrust bearing, the outer races are split, permitting the
maximum quantity of balls in each row. Thrust sharing of
two rows is accomplished by accurate match grinding of
the spacer ring to ﬁt the gap between the outer races, and
by matching the contact angle in both rows equal within
two degrees.
A high speed ball bearing, to run at temperatures up to
1000°F
Use bearing of wear resistant, high temperature tool steel.
Bearing lubricant should be dry and not sublimate.
The bearings were made of T-5 tool steel which has high
hardness and wear resistance at 1000°F. The bearings
contain a full complement of balls and no separator.
The lubricant was an ultra-thin layer of silver deposited on
the balls. The bearings were manufactured without any
snap which may abrade the silver on the balls.

A high speed mainshaft roller bearing was failing due to
skidding. Insufﬁcient load on the bearing was the cause of
skidding.
Use a pre-loaded roller bearing to overcome the skidding
problem.
The roller bearing was designed with hollow rollers which
provided a radial internal preload between the inner and
outer races.
The bearing has an inner land guided separator. The
viscous drag between the separator and the inner race
land diameter promotes the rotation of the separator.
To provide for cooling the inner race, under race cooling
grooves were located in the bore of the inner race.
A large diameter bearing to support a platform. The
platform and portion of the bearing operate in an
anisotropic quantum electrodynamic ﬁeld, while in a
vacuum. 
A 4-point contact pre-loaded ball bearing. Provide means
for heat addition or removal to maintain the desired preload. Temperature variations occur due to the ﬁeld; the
outer ring normally has a higher temperature than the inner
ring.
A split outer race, full-complement ball bearing to be made
of Cobenium rings, and sodium ﬁlled Cobenium balls. The
raceways and balls were gold plated. The gold is the
lubricant.
The inner ring of the bearing contains heating or cooling
chambers. These are formed by electron beam welding the
annular members to the ring. The ﬂuid ﬂowing through the
chambers is controlled relative to rate of ﬂow and
temperature, depending upon the speciﬁc race area
temperature serviced by that chamber. This permits control
of the geometric conﬁguration of the inner race and
preload.
The sodium ﬁlled balls are used for heat transfer between
the rings.

Long-life, wear-resistant bearings for running in water.
Use bearings of cobalt alloys for maximum corrosion and
wear resistance. Design the bearing with race curvatures
and clearances to compensate for the lack of lubricity of
the water.
Bearing rings were made of L-605 cobalt alloy. An RBC
developed cold working technique was used to increase
the hardness of the alloy to Rc 53 minimum after heat
treatment, for increased wear resistance. Normal cold
worked and heat treated hardness of this alloy is Rc 47.
The separators in the bearings were made from 17-4 PH
corrosion resistant material, heat treated to increase wear
resistance.
Support a 14" diameter rotating tube which contained
lenses. Minimal radial runout was required to prevent
distortion of the image by the lenses. Bearings should be
low in torque and corrosion resistant, pre-lubricated,
suitable for a vacuum operation. 
The rotating tube should be supported with duplex pairs of
bearings, DB mounted, preloaded, with minimal lubrication
of a low vapor pressure lubricant.
Duplex DB pair of bearings, pre-loaded, were
manufactured of passivated AISI-440-C corrosion 
resistant steel.
The radial and axial runouts were held to the following:
radial runout, inner, .0002 T.I.R.; outer, .0003 T.I.R.; axial
runout, inner, .0002 T.I.R.; outer, .0003 T.I.R. The separator
consisted of TFE rings around alternate balls for low
starting and running torque.
Bearings were lubricated with a special lubricant and then
centrifuged at 100 g’s for 10 minutes to remove the excess
oil.

BALL BEARING
CAMERA MOUNT BEARING
A lightweight, low torque bearing for use in an aerial
camera assembly.
Use a bearing with rings made of aluminum, and hard
anodize the raceway areas.
The original steel bearing design which was a double row
angular contact ball bearing in an aluminum housing was
replaced with a single row, 4 point contact bearing, with
the rings manufactured of 7075-T-651 aluminum. The
raceways of both rings were hard anodized and ground
after hard anodizing. Balls were of passivated 
AISI-440-C.
This construction utilizing the aluminum material, reduced
the overall weight of the bearing assembly from over 7 lbs.
in the original design to 3.8 lbs. in the ﬁnished unit.
In order to obtain a low running and starting torque,
alternate balls in the raceway were surrounded with TFE
separator and the raceways were grease-plated. The
bearing running torque was below 1 inch lbs. with the
starting torque being below 2 inch lbs.
A ball bearing running at 2.2 miIlion DN*, with no load, was
failing due to the fatigue of the outer race, and ball
skidding. Fatigue failures had been occurring due to the
large number of stress cycles, caused solely by the
centrifugal force of the balls. 
Reduce the number of balls in the bearing, thereby
reducing the number of stress cycles on the outer race.
Make the separator a lightweight steel design. Reduction
of the separator and ball mass would reduce the inertial
resistance, thereby reducing skidding. Change material
from AISI-52100 to a tool steel to increase resistance to
skid damage.
Bearing races and balls were made from CEVM 
AISI-M50 tool steel. The separator was manufactured 
from AISI-4340 material, hardened to Rc 26-32 and 
silver plated.
The number of balls was reduced from twenty to eight
balls, reducing the number of stress cycles by sixty
percent.
The separator conﬁguration permitted an increase 
of lubricant ﬂow through the bearing for cooling and
lubrication.
