ZKL bearings
for air pre-heaters
Air pre-heaters are very often used in thermal power stations 
for heating the air coming from the waste heat. Thanks to the air 
pre-heaters these electrical stations have a better efﬁ ciency and 
can achieve higher performances. The working conditions of airpreheaters are very demanding and therefore the installed bearings 
may be exposed to various types of wearing such as corrosion or 
abrasion. In addition, the pre-heaters work with a high temperature 
ﬂ uctuation which also increases the bearing´s technical requirements. 
ZKL produces large-size thrust spherical roller bearings for the 
rotors of air pre-heaters which can bear both high thrust as well 
as radial loads.

Thrust spherical roller bearings are speciﬁ c types of bearings that can bear both very high thrust (one way) as 
well as radial loads. ZKL produces thrust spherical roller bearings in the New Force standard which means the 
bearings have an optimized internal geometry. The beneﬁ ts for the customers are increased bearing performances 
(especially dynamic and static load rates) which lead to a longer bearing´s life. 
One of the biggest advantages of all spherical bearings is their capacity to work even with a certain misalignment. 
ZKL thrust spherical roller bearings of the 294 series can handle an angle of misalignment up to 3 °. This gives the 
shafts enough freedom to balance any inaccuracies in the machine assembly and to ensure a correct operation of 
the application for all load modes. Another beneﬁ t for the customers is the bearing´s thermal stability. All thrust 
spherical roller bearings can be exposed to the temperatures reaching up to 200 °C for a long period of time. ZKL 
produces large size thrust spherical roller bearings, as well as smaller ones. Typical applications for the use of this 
type of bearings are e.g. hooks, air-preheaters, conveying screws.
