The Company
Precision as tradition
Leonardo da Vinci himself invented the principle of the ball bearing. Would he ever have imagined the maximum speeds, ball bearings could reach in the 21st century and the loads they would have 
to withstand?
From the beginning, GMN has specialized in products for high precision and high speed applications.
GMN was founded in 1908 as the mechanical workshop Georg 
Müller Nürnberg and was one of the first companies to start serial production of high precision bearings in 1928. Today, we export 
world-wide and do continuously step up to our traditional reputation as a specialist in sophisticated bearing applications.
Precision as standard
Today, family owned and managed GMN is run by the fourth generation. The company’s following three product areas benefit from 
almost a century of ongoing development work and production 
know-how about ball bearings:
High precision ball bearings starting from precision class P4 (ABEC7) 
as spindle bearings, deep groove bearings and hybrid bearings set 
international standards in terms of reliability, precision and quality.
Machining spindles for precision and/or high speed machining underline our concentration on challenging areas of technology.
Free-wheel clutches and seals extend our product range.


5
Innovation as driving force
Around 450 employees at GMN represent an invaluable source of 
experience in successful solutions for machine tool applications, 
vacuum technology, measurement technology, medical technology and motion technology. In-house development work plus cooperation with universities, as well as international research projects on spindle technology, material science and tribology ensure 
our orientation to the future.
The ability to recognize synergies and to use them is an important 
reason for our long-term and close customer relations. We are continuously working on economical new and further developments 
and are developing optimized special solutions on the edge of 
technical feasibility.
Quality as benchmark
To meet our customers’ requirements on our products is only one 
part of our job. The real goal of efficient quality management at all 
levels and throughout all processes is the consistence of maintaining the highest standard across all product areas under cost- 
efficient aspects:
•	Careful selection of suppliers
•	Developments in our own test facilities, simulation calculations
•	Measuring device and precision measuring division as indepen-	
	 dent in-house service provider
•	High vertical range of manufacture using stateof- the-art tech- 
	 nologies such as CBN grinding, hard turning and PVD sputtering
•	Assembly under clean room conditions
•	Constant research and development work
•	Development assisted by 6-Sigma and continuous improvement 
	 processes
•	Modern project management
•	Excellent after-sales service
•	Compliance with all environmental specifications

The Process of Innovation
Consultation comes first
As soon as standard bearings do not fulfill any longer the required 
specification regarding geometry, precision, material as well as tribological and application-specific requirements, special bearings 
are requested. Especially for the application in our customers‘ innovative products, we often develop pre-finished bearing systems 
up to the start of serial production.
The application engineers of our high precision ball bearings division provide support and advice regarding all questions and 
problems right from the start, as even small changes often have a 
major effect on the design and thus on the function of the bearing. 
All environmental conditions must be taken into account; therefore our solutions are not only developed on the drawing board or 
computer but first and foremost in discussion with our customers.
Consultation – no start to goal-oriented and cost- 6 effective project development without it!
Ideas lead to system solutions
The next level proves your consultant’s engineering capacity.Stronger, higher load, faster, more precise – GMN. Our special bearings 
set technical benchmarks for a lot of applications. Hereby, we focus 
on areas of technology where we can contribute our strengths and 
expert knowledge.
Main fields of application:
•	Touchdown bearings for magnetic bearing systems
•	Vacuum applications (e. g. turbo molecular pumps)
•	Medical technology (e. g. X-ray tube bearing units)
•	Bearing systems
•	Measurement and navigation bearings and units
•	Machine tool applications
Our state-of-the-art design tools support the entire engineering 
process; test facilities of our own as well as simulation calculations 
guarantee products on the highest level.


7
Production makes the difference
GMN philosophy of producing prototypes under series conditions 
is a key element. Up to the start of series production, GMN coordinates the entire process of production by itself, as our vertical 
range of manufacturing exceeds the requirements of the production of special ball bearings by far. It is almost unique for a ball 
bearing supplier of our size to have our own PVD coating system. 
The precision measuring division, precision metal machining and 
assembly are specifically geared to the production of sophisticated 
high precision bearings and bearing systems.
•	Production of samples under series conditions
•	Measurement of all purchased precision parts and those pro- 
	 cessed in-house
•	Production with the aid of state-of-the-art technologies such as 
	 CBN grinding, hard turning, PVD sputtering (Phyiscal Vapour De- 
	 position)
Single source units throughout the whole process – Your personal 
consultant is available and monitors the continuous testing of 
components and the production process.
Start of production. What’s next?
Once started, the process of innovation keeps running. Upon completion and delivery of the product, your GMN high precision ball 
bearing team, especially your personal project consultant, will stay 
in contact with you. In close cooperation with you we accomplish 
the following tasks:
•	Product improvements
•	Further developments
•	Weak-point analyses
•	Bearing examinations

Touchdown Bearings
Security of investments
In case of overload, or the failure of the magnetic bearings, touchdown bearings prevent the bearing system from being damaged 
by the rotating parts. “Emergency” bearings must withstand the 
extreme loads during a collapse of the shaft and must be capable
of working under a lot of different environmental conditions.
Requirements on touchtown bearings:
•	Extremely high acceleration from zero to nominal speed (n x dm 
	 up to 3.5 x 106 mm/min)
•	High-impulse radial and axial forces
•	High frequency of touchdowns as well as “touch-and-goes”
•	Limited dimensions
•	Poor lubrication
•	Low-cost systems
•	Aggressive environment applications
Optimized engineering
The design of the touchdown bearing arrangement has a major 
influence on the dynamic behaviour of the shaft during emer- 
gency operation. Triple bearing systems (one pair of spindle bearings with a deep groove ball bearing) or quadruple bearing systems (two pairs of spindle bearings) can be implemented.
Important performance criteria:
•	Arrangement of the bearings (rigid, radial and/or axial spring 
	 loaded)
•	Bearing friction
•	Acceleration of touch-down bearing masses
•	Friction between shaft and bore
•	Lubrication
•	Low-cost and space-saving solution, e.g. 3-bearing system
•	High operating safety due to high load capacity, e.g. 4-bearing 
	 system
Accordance of cost and performance
An optimized bearing geometry, the use of HNS steels (High Nitrogen Steel) and ceramic balls as well as an application-specific 
tribology guarantee a high frequency of touchdowns.
In low-cost systems, GMN PVD ball coating enables the use of steel 
balls along with significant savings. The technical performance of 
high-end applications, on the other hand, can be further improved 
by using PVD coating on ceramic balls.
The use of magnetic bearings gets more and more important for CO2 
laser systems, liquid pumps as well as in the optical industry.
GMN has successfully been promoting the development and production of touchdown bearings since the mid-nineties.

Vacuum Technology
Long life guarantee
Vacuum technology is substantial for the research, development 
and production of innovative products from semiconductor industry to solar power industry. Depending on the application, the design of the vacuum pump differs in respect of final pressure, pumping speed or resistance to various media. The bearing is the heart
of the vacuum pump – in a harsh vacuum environment and high 
speeds, only robust bearings guarantee a long life.
Requirements on bearings for turbo molecular pumps:
•	Long life
•	Absolute reliability
•	High speeds
•	Low noise level
•	Low vibration
•	Cleanliness
In close cooperation with industrial partners, GMN develops overall 
concepts for complex bearing systems, especially for turbo molecular 
pumps (TMP).
Optimized engineering
For turbo molecular pumps GMN develops custom made high precision ball bearings with special dimensions, designs and cages.
Important performance criteria:
•	Product-optimized bearing design
•	Use of shielded bearings for protection from contamination and 
	 to increase life
•	Ceramic balls for higher speeds, minimum friction and optimized 
	 bearing dynamics
•	Total tribology concept (lubrication, preservation, surface quality, 
	 materials)
•	For grease lubrication, use of the GMN TXM cage for low-vibrati- 
	 on, low-noise running


11

•	Special design (dimensions, internal design, cage)


12
Medical Technology / X-Ray
Extraordinary resilience
The extreme operating conditions for the bearing unit of rotating 
anode X-ray tubes are a complex challenge and require experience 
in the area of materials, surface technology as well as the design 
of the system as a whole.
Requirements on bearings for X-ray tube systems:
•	Temperatures up to 550° C surrounding the bearing
•	Ultra-high vacuum (10-7 bis 10-9 mbar)
•	Electric conductivity, high voltage
•	Dry lubrication
•	Surface pressure inside the bearing of up to 3,200 N/mm2
•	Low running noise
•	Low vibrations
•	No bearing-related particles or flitter
Based on bearings and bearing units for more than 100,000 X-ray 
tube systems – amongst them one of the first tubes world-wide 
which enabled X-rays of the heart – GMN has been an innovative 
and reliable partner to medical technology for decades.
Optimized engineering
GMN coats components such as bearing rings, sliding fits and balls 
on its own PVD sputter system.
Ball coatings in lead or silver with a thickness of nanometers 
(10-9 m) have resulted from various research projects and are the 
basis for the low-noise, low-vibration, particle-free GMN bearing 
systems which perform impressively in their various applications.
Accordance of cost and performance
In addition, particle-free tribology enables a simplified design without complex and cost-intensive shielding of the bearings. Calculation tools, trials and design-tocost studies are reflected in the 
design of the systems. Compared to a spring-preloaded system, 
the use of temperature-compensated bearing units increasingly
proves to be the better solution from both a technical and economic point of view.
The sophisticated assembly concept enables an optimum design 
and in addition reduces the number of critical components as well 
as costs. A reliable chain of suppliers for precision vacuum components, GMN measurement technology and production equipment
for plasma cleaning and vacuum packaging provide our customers 
with the required safety in this highly sensitive field of application. 
In this respect, our close contact with leading partners in technology from both industry and research is equally important.

Bearing Systems
Solutions for precise bearing units
Where individual bearings no longer provide a solution, bearing 
systems can be the key to success. Here it makes no difference 
whether your devices are equipped with high-precision optics, for 
instance, or operate under extreme ambient conditions. Bearing 
systems provide your product with a unique characteristic and can 
mature to an economic diversity of variants in the module principle. Here individual requirements regarding lubrication, materials 
used, installation sizes required and necessary precision are taken 
into account.
Requirements on bearing systems:
•	All components must comply with the technical requirements 
	 with regard to quality and characteristics
•	Material selection, bearing design, machining as well as cleaning 
	 and assembly need to be carefully harmonized
•	Appropriate selection of lubricants for maximum durability of 
	 the bearing system
•	Cost optimization due to production grade adapted to custo- 
	 mers’ requirements
GMN develops and produces ready-to-install, complex bearing systems apart from special bearings. The customer can concentrate on 
his core competencies by procuring the entire bearing system.
Optimized engineering and
production from one single source
The success of a product often depends on the interplay of many 
details far beyond the ball bearing layout. Finally, everything has to 
fit perfectly. Thus shaft and housing fits and internal preloads are 
optimized for the respective application and negative side effects 
must not arise from the lubricant used in connection with the existing work environment.
Important performance criteria:
•	Functionality of the system
•	Selection of materials suitable for the respective application
•	Cleanliness of the components thus high purity of the bearing 
	 system and prevention of contamination, e.g. in optical applica- 
	 tions
•	Low-vibration and low-friction running
•	Perfect adaptation of the system to attachment point

Materials
GMN ball bearings with rings and balls made of ball bearing steel 
100Cr6 (SAE52100) are used for normal applications. For applications with high speeds and high loads, hybrid bearings with rings 
made of 100Cr6 and balls made of ceramic (e.g. silicon nitride 
Si3N4) are often a reasonable alternative.
All ball bearings are available as hybrid bearings.
Alternatively, high-temperature steels as well as HNS steel (High 
Nitrogen Steel) are used.
Cages
GMN ball bearings are available with standard cages made of 
textile reinforced phenolic resin which are guided on the outer or 
inner ring. Other bearing designs and materials (such as TORLON, 
Al-Bronze) can be used for customer-specific applications.
More than 20 years ago, GMN developed and launched the lowwear TXM cage made of PEEK (polyetheretherketone). It has been 
sold over a hundred thousand times and is still state of the art. It 
was especially designed for grease lubrication and allows operating temperatures of up to 250 °C. The optimized ball pockets serve 
as a grease reservoir and guarantee a long life. The TXM cage has 
proven to be a reliable solution to cage vibrations.

Cleaning
Before PVD coating or as final treatment for vacuum applications, 
the components are cleaned in several processing steps:
•	Ultrasound cleaning
•	Degreasing
•	Vacuum drying
•	Plasma cleaning
For many applications additional purification annealing of the 
components is required.
Coating thickness measurement and material 
analysis (XRF)
GMN applies the latest high technology to analyse coatings. 
Coating thickness measurements at the nanoscale and analyses 
of coating materials are measurements necessary and helpful for 
high-end bearings in medical and ultra-high vacuum engineering.
•	High-precision and programmable XY(Z) measuring table
•	Analysis and coating thickness measurement of very thin films 
	 and multi-coating systems
•	Analysis of the basic material through a coating system
