Perfect solution for cage creep issues 
by a built-in rack and pinion mechanism as an original design.
■ Easy Replacement
Since they have the same external dimensions to 
those of the existing Crossed Roller Way and 
Crossed Roller Way Unit, existing Crossed Roller 
Way and Crossed Roller Way Unit can be replaced 
without any mounting dimensions modiﬁcation.
Interchangeable in Mounting Dimensions!
Adoption of original structure of arranging a rack inside the way keeps the 
same mounting dimensions as conventional Crossed Roller Way CRW.
* The mounting dimensions of CRWG1…
H and CRW1 are different.
■ Improved Running Accuracy
Extremely high running accuracy can be achieved without 
run deﬂection by recirculating type linear motion rolling 
guide.
■ Suitable for Micro-Feeding
Improvement of precision positioning accuracy and 
superior corresponding feature to micro-feeding command 
can be expected because of the linear motion without 
stick-slip by extremely small frictional resistance.
Smooth and Extremely-High Accurate Operation!
Combination of precisely ﬁnished 
raceways and non-recirculating type 
linear motion rolling guide with super 
high precision rollers provides superbly 
smooth motion with very high accuracy.

IKO Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way CRWG is a 
product with a cage creep IKO proof function using a 
rack and pinion mechanism originated from the 
Crossed Roller Way CRW featuring smooth linear 
motion with super high accuracy.
CRWG … H is high load capacity type of CRWG, 
which has achieved greatly increased load rating by 
redesigning of raceway of CRWG.
IKO Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way Unit 
CRWUG is a product with a cage creep proof 
function-provided Crossed Roller Way CRWG 
mounted into a ground-ﬁnished rigid table and bed.

● Superior load balance
This unit has a roller cage with cylindrical rollers 
alternately orthogonalized between two ways whose two 
V-shaped surfaces are used as track groove, which 
allows receiving of loads in any direction.
● Solves cage creep problem
CRWG and CRWG…H units, which have 
originally-designed rack and pinion mechanism built-in, 
solve the cage creep issue and support high-speed & 
high-tact operation and vertical axis application.
● High load capacity type CRWG…H
CRWG…H has achieved greatly increased load rating by 
redesigning of raceway of CRWG, thereby downsizing the 
machine and equipment and prolonging their lifetime.
● Standard type and module type
There are two types in the CRW: one is standard type of 
using four ways and two roller cages in combination as a 
set and the other is module type of integrating two 
internal ways in a single structure.
● Easy mounting
The mounting holes of the way are provided with boring 
and female thread, so that the mounting structure is not 
restricted. The module type with two internal ways 
integrated in a single structure is simple in mounting 
structure, thus producing high accuracy linear motion.
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistance to corrosion, 
so that they are suitable for applications where rust prevention oil is 
not preferred, such as in a cleanroom environment.

Load Rating and Allowable Load    

Basic dynamic load rating C, basic static load rating C0, and allowable load F 
of the CRWG series and CRWG…H series show values for downward loads 
in case of parallel arrangement of four ways and two pairs of roller cages as 
one set. (Refer to Fig. 5) In addition, the upward and lateral load rating is the 
same as downward load rating.
For the CRW series, since the number of cylindrical rollers that share load of 
each direction varies, the load rating for each load direction and allowable 
load must be obtained. In addition, basic dynamic load rating CU, basic static 
load rating C0U, and allowable load FU in the dimension table show values per 
cylindrical roller.
Basic dynamic load rating C, basic static load rating C0, and allowable load F 
of the CRW series are obtained based on the equation indicated in Table 8.1 
and Table 8.2.
For more information on the definition of load rating and calculated load, see 
page Ⅲ-3.
Allowable load
Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on contact surface to 
which maximum contact stress is applied and the sum of whose elastic 
deformation of rolling elements and raceway is small.
Therefore, use applied load within the allowable load range if very smooth 
rolling motion and high accuracy are required.

Selection of CRW Series    

For selection of CRW series specifications, stroke length 
and the number of cylindrical rollers, as well as accuracy, 
load rating and allowable load, must be determined.
Stroke length and the number of cylindrical rollers
Stroke length of the CRW series affects the way length and 
the number of cylindrical rollers.
Therefore, select specifications by following the procedure 
below taking into account the stroke length used and 
applied load.
❶ Calculation of way length
The way length, which should be 1.5 times longer than the 
stroke length used, is obtained from the equation below.
L≧1.5S  
(13)
Where   L: Way length  mm
 S: Stroke length used  mm
❷ Calculation of maximum stroke length
Ideally the stroke length used should be less than 80% of 
the maximum stroke length, which is obtained from the 
equation below.
S1≧
0.8  S  
(14)
Where  S1: Maximum stroke length  mm
S : Stroke length used  mm
L≧1.5S
❸ Calculation of cage length and the number of rollers
With the way length and maximum stroke length determined, 
the allowable length for cage can be calculated.
Calculation method of the cage length varies depending on 
specifications of end screws and end stopper fitted to the 
way end.
(1)  With standard end screws and end stopper SA (excluding Size 1 series)
The dimensions between rollers at both ends is obtained from 
the following equation by using a value obtained by subtracting 
a half of the maximum stroke length from the way length.
LR＝L－S1
(15)
Where  LR :  Allowable dimensions between rollers at both 
ends  mm
L  : Way length  mm
S1 : Maximum stroke length  mm
The number of rollers to be incorporated in a roller cage is 
obtained by the following equation.
Z＝LR－DW
(16)
Where  Z   :  Number of cylindrical rollers (figures after the 
decimal fractions are omitted)
LR  :  Allowed dimensions between rollers at both 
ends  mm
DW:  Diameter of cylindrical rollers (refer to the 
dimension table)  mm
p   :  Inter-pitch dimensions of cylindrical rollers 
(refer to the dimension table)  mm
LR
S1/2
S1/2
(2) For Size 1 series
The stroke length is regulated by cage and end stopper and 
the cage length is obtained by the following equation.
R＝L－S1
(17)
Where  R: Allowable cage length  mm
L: Way length  mm
S1: Maximum stroke length  mm
The number of rollers to be incorporated in a roller cage is 
obtained by the following equation.
Z＝R－2e ＋1

(18)
Where Z :  Number of cylindrical rollers (figures after the 
decimal fractions are omitted)
R: Allowable cage length  mm
e :  End dimension of cage (refer to the dimension 
table)  mm
p :  Inter-pitch dimensions of cylindrical rollers (refer 
to the dimension table)  mm
(3) For end stopper SB and wiper seal
The stroke length is regulated by cage and end stopper or 
wiper seal and the cage length is obtained by the following 
equation.
R=L－t2－S1  
(19)
Where  R : Allowable cage length  mm
L : Way length  mm
S1 : Maximum stroke length  mm
t2 :  Thickness of end stopper SB or wiper seal mm 
(See Table 6 in page Ⅱ-13, and Table 7 in page 
Ⅱ-14)
The number of rollers to be incorporated in a roller cage is 
obtained by the equation (18) as with the Size 1 series.
S1/2
S1/2
Calculation examples
Form of use   ………………………………………… CRW 6
Applied load  ………………………………………… P ＝ 7000 N
Stroke length ………………………………………… S ＝ 195 mm
Select specifications for parallel use of Crossed Roller Way 
under the above conditions (refer to Fig. 26 in page Ⅱ-23).
❶ Calculation of way length
The way length L is calculated from the equation (13).
L≧1.5S＝1.5×195＝292.5
Therefore, select L = 300 mm based on the standard length 
in the dimension table.
❷ Calculation of maximum stroke length
The maximum stroke length S1 is calculated from the 
equation （14）.
S1≧
S＝
0.8  ×195≒244
Allowable dimensions between rollers at both ends LR is 
calculated from the equation (15).
LR＝ L－S1 ＝300－244
2  ＝178
❸ Calculation of the number of rollers
The number of cylindrical rollers Z is calculated from the 
equation (16). However, D W and p in this form are 
DW = 6 mm、p = 9 mm according to the dimension table.
Z＝LR－DW ＋1＝178－6
＋1≒20.1
Therefore, it should be Z = 20 by omitting figures after the 
decimal fractions.
❹ Calculation of allowable load
Allowable load in parallel arrangement F is calculated from 
equation (9) described in Table 8.2 in page Ⅱ-16. However, 
allowable load per cylindrical roller FU is FU = 769 N 
according to the dimension table.
F＝2( Z
―2)F
U＝2(20
―2 )×769＝15380
Therefore, allowable load F is larger than applied load P = 
7000 N. When allowable load becomes smaller than applied 
load, it is necessary to increase the number of cylindrical 
rollers by extending way length, or increase the cylindrical 
roller diameter.
❺ Determination of specifications
Specifications obtained in accordance with the above is 
CRW6-300 and the number of cylindrical rollers is 20.

Ⅱ－19


Grease is not pre-packed in the CRWG series, CRWG…H 
series and CRW series, so please perform adequate 
lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the CRWG series, CRWG…H series and CRW series. 
Generally, oil lubrication should be selected for high speed or 
low frictional resistance, and grease lubrication for low speed. 
For grease lubrication, use of high-quality lithium-soap base 
grease is recommended. For light load and low speed, apply 
grease or oil to raceway, rack and pinion gear first and then 
reapply accordingly. However, the structure as indicated in 
the Fig. 6 allows for easy reapplication. In addition, since the 
clearance between ways is small for CRWG…H series, apply 
grease or oil directly to raceway for re-greasing.
Fig. 6  Example of lubrication system
Since the CRWG series, CRWG…H series and CRW series 
are finished with high accuracy, harmful foreign substances 
such as dust and particles entering into the bearing will cause 
low life or impaired accuracy. To prevent harmful foreign 
substances such as dust, particles and water from outside 
from entering, it is recommended to attach non-contact type 
labyrinth seal as indicated in Fig. 7, or contact type wiper seal 
as indicated in the Fig. 8 to both sides.
Fig. 7  Example of labyrinth seal
Fig. 8  Example of wiper seal
❶ Handling
As the CRWG series, CRWG…H series and CRW series are 
designed highly precisely, take extra care for handling.
A pinion gear and cylindrical roller are incorporated with the 
cage for the CRWG series and CRWG…H series. When the 
cage is dropped or handled roughly, the pinion gear and 
cylindrical roller may come off. Especially for CRWG…H, 
grabbing the cylindrical roller may take it off, so be sure to 
hold the cage body for handling. In addition, do not cut off 
the cage as doing so may cause pinion gear coming off and 
breakage of gear joint section.
A rack is incorporated with the way for the CRWG series 
and CRWG…H series. In operation, take note that the rack 
may come off when the end screw is removed.
Though the cage for the CRW series may cut off to 
necessary length, handle it with care not to deform it when 
cutting.
❷ Accuracy of mounting part
Examples of typical mounting surface processing are shown 
in Fig. 9.1 and Fig. 9.2.
General processing accuracy of mounting surface is 
according to Table 9. However, care should be exercised as 
mounting surface accuracy directly affects running accuracy. 
Especially when high running accuracy is required, the 
processing accuracy higher than that indicated in Table 9 is 
required.
Fig. 9.1 Example of processing of CRWG,  
CRWG…H and CRW mounting surface
Fig. 9.2 Example of processing of CRWM mounting 
Table 9  Accuracy of mounting part
Accuracy of A 
・Directly affects running accuracy.
For the flatness of two mounting surfaces 
on table and bed sides, allowable value 
approximate to the parallelism indicated 
in Fig. 1 in page Ⅱ-11 is recommended.
Accuracy of B 
and C surfaces
・Flatness
Affects preload (refer to ❹ Preload 
adjustment mechanism).
Ⅱ－11Allowable value approximate to the 
parallelism indicated in Fig. 1 in page Ⅱ
-11 is recommended.
・Squareness
Affects rigidity in preload direction of the 
mounting part of the CRWG series, 
CRWG…H series and CRW series.
Process to sufficiently high accuracy.
❸ Shape of mounting part
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it is 
recommended to have relieved fillet as indicated in Fig. 10.
In addition, a clearance of 0.5 mm or higher should be made 
between the way and the mating member material.
Fig. 10  Shape of mounting part
❹ Preload adjustment mechanism
For use with preload, use the preload adjusting screw as 
indicated in Fig. 11 as a general way. Preload adjusting 
screw nominal dimensions and mounting position should be 
in accordance with the way fixing bolt dimensions and 
position. Press the center of the way H dimensions.
Preload amount varies depending on operational conditions 
of your machine and device. However, as excessive preload 
may lead to short life and damage on the raceway, it is 
typically ideal to adjust to zero clearance or slight preload 
state. When accuracy and rigidity are required, use a push 
plate or tapered jib as indicated in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, 
respectively.
Fig. 11  Example of typical preload adjustment
0.5 or higher
0.5 or higher
Fig. 12  Example of push plate
Fig. 13  Example of tapered jib
❺ Operating temperature
As synthetic resin components are used for the CRWG 
series and CRWG…H series, the maximum operating 
temperature is 120°C, while it should be lower than 100°C 
for continuous use. When it exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
As synthetic resin components are not used for the CRW 
series, it may be used at high temperature. However, when it 
exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
❻ Maximum velocity
Operating velocity should be lower than 50 m/min for the 
CRWG series and CRWG…H series, and lower than 30 m/
min for the CRW series.
❼ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the CRWG series, 
CRWG…H series and CRW series is indicated in Table 10. 
When vibration and shock are large or moment load is 
applied, it is recommended to fix by using the torque 1.3 
times larger than that indicated in the table. In addition, 
when high running accuracy is required with no vibration 
and shock, it may be fixed by using torque smaller than that 
indicated in the table, however, it is recommended to use 
adhesive agent to fasten the screw, or to use stop bolts.

temporary adjustment until the clearance between ways 
becomes zero. 
・Fully stroke the table softly and correct the roller cage 
position to the center.
Fig. 30  Position alignment before operation
❻ Preload adjustment
・Preload adjustment is performed with fixing screws of the 
preload-adjusting-side way tightened temporarily.
・Preload adjustment is started from the preload adjusting 
screw at the center of way length and then both ends in 
turn.
・While measuring the clearance on the table sides, tighten 
the preload adjusting screws subsequently until deflection 
of the dial gauge stops. Measure the tightening torque for 
preload adjusting screws at this point.
・When adjusting preload adjusting screw near either end, 
stroke the table softly and check that the cylindrical roller 
is on the preload adjusting screw section.
・After the above procedure, the clearance becomes zero or 
in slight preload state, but preload is still not adjusted 
evenly. With the same procedure again, re-adjust all the 
preload adjusting screws evenly to the torque previously 
measured.

Mounting
Mating marks module type CRW series
CRWM has mating marks to ensure the best running 
accuracy after mounting based on the parallelism 
measurement result of reference mounting surface and 
raceway. When assembling the ways, align the mating marks 
of ways with the same end side as indicated in Fig. 36.

❼ Full tightening of preload-adjustment-side way
・Fixing screws are lightly tightened to even torque. As with 
preload adjusting screws, temporarily fix them to torque 
similar to the specified torque in turn from the way center 
to both ends.
・When tightening fixing screws near either end, stroke the 
table softly and check that the cylindrical roller is on fixing 
screw section.
・Finally with the same procedure, fully tighten all the fixing 
screws evenly to the specified torque.
❽ Check after assembly
・Fully stroke the table softly and check that running is 
smooth without abnormal noise.
・Measure the table upper and side surfaces with dial gauge 
or the like and check the running accuracy.
Fig. 32  Accuracy check after assembly
Mounting of module type CRW series
Typical mounting structure of CRWM is shown in Fig. 33. 
For mounting at this point, generally follow the procedure 
below.
Fig. 33  Example of mounting of CRWM
❶ Preparation for mounting
・Crossed Roller Way CRWM is packed by set (1 center 
way, 2 ways and 2 pairs of roller cages). Be careful not to 
mix with other sets.
・Remove end screws and end stopper, clean up each part 
with clean wash fluid and then apply rust prevention and 
lubrication oil.
❷ Cleanup of mounting surface
・Remove burrs and blemishes on the machine mounting 
surface with an oil-stone, etc. Be careful about corner 
groove on the mounting surface, too.
・Wipe off dust and dirt with clean cloth and apply rust 
prevention and lubrication oil lightly.
❸ Mounting of center way
・Roughly align the center way to the mounting surface and 
lightly fix it with fixing screws.
・While measuring mounting parallelism of the center way 
and raceway to the reference surface of running 
parallelism for position correction, temporarily tighten the 
fixing screws to the even tightening torque.
・Evenly tighten all the fixing screws to the specified 
tightening torque.

❹ Processing of dowel pin hole
・When dowel pins are used, machine holes on the bed in 
alignment with dowel pin holes near either end of the 
center way.
・Dowel pin hole of the center way is finished for H7. Finish 
bed holes in the same way.
・Diameter and its allowance of dowel pin hole of the center 
way vary depending on the dimension table.
・Eliminate cutting chips and clean up again as necessary. 
When machines for mounting of the center way are large, 
clean them up with the center way removed and then 
reassemble.
・Load the dowel pins and check the parallelism of the 
reference surface of the running parallelism and the 
raceway of the center way again.

❺ Mounting of table-side way
・Follow the mounting of standard type CRW series.
❻ Operation of table and bed
・Follow the mounting of standard type CRW series.
❼ Preload adjustment
・Follow the mounting of standard type CRW series.
❽ Full tightening of preload-adjustment-side way
・Follow the mounting of standard type CRW series.

● Solves cage creep issue
As CRWG with cage creep proof function is incorporated 
with CRWUG, there is no risk of cage creep and it works 
reliable in high-speed and high-tact operation, or in 
vertical axis.
● Easy mounting
Mounting surface is precisely grounded. In addition, 
female screws and boring are used for table and bed, 
respectively to ensure appropriate preload state. 
Therefore, highly reliable linear motion can be achieved 
just by ﬁtting them to the machine and device.
● High rigidity and high accuracy
Since CRWG or CRW with excellent load balance is 
incorporated with grounded high rigidity table and bed, 
elastic deformation is small for load in every direction, 
leading to highly accurate and stable linear motion.
● Wide variation
Three types of CRWU with different sectional shapes are 
available with many size variations. You can select an 
optimal product for the speciﬁcations of your machine 
and device.

　Accuracy    


Indicate values for down direction for load rating of CRWUG 
and CRWU series.
In addition, the upward and lateral load rating is the same as 
downward load rating.
For more information on the definition of load rating and 
calculated load, see page Ⅲ-3.

Accuracy of CRWUG series and CRWU series is indicated in 
Table 2. Parallelism at the center of the table represents 
parallelism of height when the table is stroked.
Parallelism at the side of the table represents parallelism of 
the side (preload adjusting screw side) when the table is 
stroked.
In addition, though allowance of unit height H is designed as 
±0.1 mm, units with height variation of less than 0.01 mm 
among multiple units are also available. When special 
accuracy is needed, contact IKO.

Allowable load
Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on 
contact surface to which maximum contact stress is applied 
and the sum of whose elastic deformation of rolling elements 
and raceway is small.
Therefore, use applied load within the allowable load range if 
very smooth rolling motion and high accuracy are required.

Grease is not pre-packed in the CRWUG series and CRWU 
series, so please perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the CRWUG series and CRWU series. Generally, oil 
lubrication should be selected for high speed or low 
frictional resistance, and grease lubrication for low speed. 
For grease lubrication, use of high-quality lithium-soap base 
grease is recommended.
Since the CRWUG series and CRWU series are finished with 
high accuracy, harmful foreign substances such as dust and 
particles entering into the bearing will cause low life or 
impaired accuracy. For applications in other than clean 
environment, cover the entire unit with a protective case, 
etc. to prevent harmful foreign substances such as dust, 
particles and water from outside from entering.
❶ Handling
As the CRWUG series and CRWU series are designed highly 
precisely, take extra care for handling.
Cage of the CRWUG series has a pinion gear incorporated. 
When the cage is dropped or handled roughly, the pinion 
gear may come off. In addition, do not cut off the cage as 
doing so may cause pinion gear coming off and breakage of 
gear joint section.
Way of the CRWUG series has a rack incorporated. In 
operation, take note that the rack may come off when the 
end screw is removed.
For the CRWU series, the cage may be deviated from the 
right position due to offset load or irregular and high-velocity 
motion, etc. Fully stroke it once in certain operating time or 
certain number of reciprocating motion to correct the cage 
position.
❷ Preload re-adjustment
Preload amount of the CRWUG series and CRWU series is 
adjusted to zero or slight preload state, so they may be used 
as they are.
Preload amount of the CRWUG series, CRWU, and CRWU…
R may be re-adjusted by following the procedure below.
Preload adjustment is started from the preload adjusting 
screw at the center of way length and then both ends in turn, 
with fixing screws of the preload adjusting side way 
temporarily fixed.
While measuring the clearance on the table sides, tighten the 
preload adjusting screws subsequently until deflection of the 
dial gauge stops. Measure the tightening torque for preload 
adjusting screws at this point.
When adjusting preload adjusting screw near either end, 
stroke the table softly and check that the cylindrical roller is 
on the preload adjusting screw section.
After the above procedure, the clearance becomes zero or in 
slight preload state, but preload is still not adjusted evenly. 
With the same procedure again, re-adjust all the preload 
adjusting screws evenly to the torque previously measured.
Fig. 3  Example of preload adjustment method
❸ Operating temperature
As synthetic resin components are used for the CRWUG 
series, the maximum operating temperature is 120°C, while 
it should be lower than 100°C for continuous use. When it 
exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
As synthetic resin components are not used for the CRWU 
series, it may be used at high temperature. However, when it 
exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
❹ Maximum velocity
Operating velocity should not exceed 30 m/min during 
operation.
❺ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Table 3 shows typical tightening torque for mounting 
CRWUG Series and CRWU Series. When vibration and 
shock are large or moment load is applied, it is 
recommended to fix by using the torque 1.3 times larger 
than that indicated in the table. In addition, when high 
running accuracy is required with no vibration and shock, it 
may be fixed by using torque smaller than that indicated in 
the table, however, it is recommended to use adhesive 
agent to fasten the screw, or to use stop bolts.

❻ Dowel pin hole of CRWU…R
A dowel pin hole is machined on the center way of the 
CRWU…R. When a dowel pin is used, machine a hole on 
the mounting surface of the machine after mounting of the 
center way.
Refer to the dimension table for diameter and its tolerances 
of dowel pin hole of the center way.
❼ Mounting part dimensions of CRWU…R
Not to allow the table to interfere with the mounting surface, 
it is necessary to set mounting surface height referring to 
the dimensions H1 and H in the dimension table.
Example bed mounting dimensions are indicated in Table 4.

● High accuracy
Simultaneous grinding process of two-row track grooves 
is applied to table and bed, which provides small 
processing errors and realizes linear motion of high 
accuracy.
Stainless steel highly resistant to corrosion is used for all 
steel components, so that they are suitable for 
applications where rust prevention oil is not preferred, 
such as in a cleanroom environment.
● Simple limited linear motion guide structure
Small and simple limited stroke type structure incorporated 
with balls and retainer between integrated table and bed.
With two-row four-point contact structure, stable accuracy 
and rigidity can be achieved even in applications where 
ﬂuctuating load and complex load are applied.
● Smooth operations
As each component is ﬁnished with accuracy without 
recirculation resistance of the balls, light and smooth 
operations are obtained.

Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on 
contact surface to which maximum contact stress is applied 
and the sum of whose elastic deformation of rolling 
elements and raceway is small.
Therefore, use applied load within the allowable load range 
if very smooth rolling motion and high accuracy are required.
The BWU series must be used with its load rating corrected 
in accordance to the load direction. The basic dynamic load 
rating and basic static load rating shown in the dimension 
table should be corrected to values in Table 2.

（1）  Parallelism at the center of the table represents parallelism 
of height when the table is stroked.
（2）  Parallelism at the side of the table represents parallelism 
of the side (the opposite side of 
 mark) when the 
table is stroked.
Preload for the BWU series is adjusted to proper preload 
state.
Grease is not pre-packed in the BWU series, so please 
perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Upon delivery, anti-rust oil is applied. Therefore, perform 
cleaning with clean solution before mounting and apply 
high-quality lubrication oil or grease before use. For grease 
lubrication, use of high-quality lithium-soap base grease is 
recommended.
Since no grease nipple or oil hole is provided, apply grease 
directly to the raceway part of the bed when supplying the 
grease.
No dust protection seal is provided for BWU series. For 
applications in other than clean environment, cover the 
entire unit with a protective case, etc. to prevent harmful 
foreign substances such as dust and particles from outside 
from entering.




 Precaution for Mounting    

Ⅱ－80
Ⅱ－79
❶ Reference mounting surface
Reference mounting surface of the BWU series is the 
opposite side of the 
 mark. (See Fig. 1)
Fig. 1  Reference mounting surface and mounting examples
❷ Typical mounting structure
As indicated in Fig.1, reference mounting surfaces B and D, 
and mounting surfaces A and C are precisely ground. 
Therefore, by machining the reference mounting surface of 
the mating member and the mounting surface, such as 
machine or device, to high accuracy and mounting them 
properly, stable linear motion with high accuracy is realized.
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved fillet as indicated in the 
illustration in Table 5. The value indicated in Table 5 is 
recommended for the shoulder height on the mating side.

table side

❸ When lateral load is the primary load
As indicated in Fig. 2, firmly fix the sides of the table and 
bed with pressure plates.
Fig. 2  Mounting example when lateral load is the primary load
❹ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the BWU series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 6. If 
the mating member material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, 
reduce the tightening torque depending on the strength 
characteristics of the mating member material.

Remark:   The tightening torque is calculated based on property

❶ Handling
When high running accuracy is required, set the load point 
at the center of the table (or bed) and use with sufficient 
stroke length.
For the BWU series, the retainer may be deviated from the 
right position due to offset load or irregular and high-velocity 
motion, etc. Fully stroke it once in certain operating time or 
certain number of reciprocating motion to correct the 
retainer position.
Since there is no built-in mechanical stopper to regulate 
linear motion in the event of collision, install a stopper 
mechanism in proximity if risk of overstroke exists.
The fixing thread depth of mounting screws for table must 
not exceed the maximum fixing thread depth indicated in 
the table of dimensions. Since the mounting screw hole for 
the table is penetrated, the bed or retainer will be pushed by 
the screw if the fixing thread depth is too deep, and the 
running accuracy and life may be adversely affected.
❷ Operating temperature
As synthetic resin components are not used for the BWU 
series, it may be used at high temperature. However, when it 
exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
❸ Maximum velocity
Operating velocity should not exceed 30 m/min during 
operation.

● Light weight and compact
Weight is saved by precise forming of stainless steel plate to 
U shape and integration of the way and mounting surface, 
and downsizing was realized by functional allocation of parts.
● Stable performance
With simple two-row four-point contact structure, motion 
accuracy with stable load carrying capacity and high motion 
accuracy can be achieved for load in every direction.
● Quiet and smooth operations
The excellent retaining and guiding mechanism of the ball and 
precisely-ﬁnished raceway realizes very quiet and smooth operations.
High response characteristics and positioning accuracy are obtained 
for micro-feeding operation as well.
● High safety
Since non-combustible or self-extinguishing materials are 
used for all synthetic resin components, they may be used 
for wide range of applications including household ofﬁce 
automation equipment that requires incombustibility.
Stainless steel highly resistant to corrosion is used for all 
steel components, so that they are suitable for 
applications where rust prevention oil is not preferred, 
such as in a cleanroom environment.

Characteristics
BSP
Retainer made of special synthetic resin 
is used to prevent interference noise from 
contact of balls. This type performs very 
smooth and light limited linear motion 
without stick-slip.
BSPG
A pinion gear assembled in the retainer 
integrated with two-row ball raceway is engaged 
with the racks fixed to the table and bed to 
prevent creeping of retainer position. Like BSP, 
this type also performs smooth linear motion.
BSR
The ball circulation structure made of 
special synthetic resin realizes quiet and 
smooth endless linear motion according 
to the length of a track rail.

 Precaution for Mounting    

❶ Applied load
For use with stable and high running accuracy, it is 
recommended to use applied load around 20% or lower of 
the basic static load rating.
❷ Handling
When high running accuracy is required for BSP and BSPG, 
set the load point at the center of the table (or bed) and use 
with sufficient stroke length.
For the BSP, the retainer may be deviated from the right 
position due to offset load or irregular and high-velocity 
motion, etc. Fully stroke it once in certain operating time or 
certain number of reciprocating motion to correct the 
retainer position. If it is difficult to correct the retainer 
position, use BSPG or BSR.
Since BSP, BSPG and BSR have no built-in mechanical 
stopper to regulate linear motion in the event of collision, 
install a stopper mechanism in proximity if risk of overstroke 
exists.
❸ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120°C and 
temperature up to 100°C is allowed for continuous 
operation. However, when it exceeds 100°C, contact IKO.
❹ Maximum velocity
Operating velocity should not exceed 30 m/min during 
operation.
❶ Reference mounting surface
Reference mounting surface is the opposite side of the 
 mark.
BSP・BSPG
BSR
Fig. 1  Reference mounting surface
❷ Typical mounting structure
The mating surface to mount BSP, BSPG and BSR should 
be finished to high accuracy as much as possible so as not 
to affect the motion accuracy.
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved fillet as indicated in Fig. 1, 
but you may also mount it based on R1 dimension indicated 
in Table 5. The value indicated in Table 5 is recommended 
for the shoulder height on the mating side.
❸ Mounting
The fixing thread depth of fixing screws must not exceed the 
maximum fixing thread depth indicated in the dimension 
table.
When mounting BSP and BSPG, use female screws of the 
table and bed, or insert screws smaller by one size to the 
female screws. However, note that BSP 715 SL through BSP 
740 SL cannot be mounted from the inside of the table and 
bed.
When mounting the track rail of BSR, use female screws of 
the track rail or insert screws smaller by one size to the 
female screws. However, note that BSR 1530 SL through 
BSR 2040 SL cannot be mounted from the inside of the 
track rail. In addition, when BSR 1230 SL through BSR 1260 
SL are to be mounted from the inside of the track rail, 
contact IKO.
❹ Tightening torque for fixing screw
If the fixing force of BSP, BSPG and BSR toward the mating 
surface is too strong, performance and accuracy are 
adversely affected. Although it depends on material, rigidity 
and finishing condition of the mating surface, it is generally 
recommended to use smaller tightening torque for fixing 
screws and use value comparable to Table 6. In addition, 
use a stopper measure such as adhesive agent if fixing 
screw may be loosened by vibration, etc.

● Smooth operations
Since the ball is guided by the retainer made of synthetic 
resin and rotates on high accuracy round shank way, it 
can obtain a light and smooth motion.
● Excellent corrosion resistance
The ball and way are mode of stainless steel and the 
surface of table and bed have anodic oxidization coating, 
allowing high corrosion resistance.
● Light weight linear motion guide unit
Since the product uses aluminum alloy for table and bed, 
it is a light weight and compact limited linear motion guide 
unit.
● Easy mounting
Since the product is properly preloaded, it can easily gain 
a stable linear motion only by ﬁxing it against precisely 
grounded mounting surface with bolts.

Allowable Load    


Ⅱ－97
Ⅱ－98
Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on 
contact surface to which maximum contact stress is applied 
and the sum of whose elastic deformation of rolling 
elements and raceway is small.
Fig.1  Direction of allowable load
❶ Running accuracy
Parallelism at the table center against the bed mounting 
surface (see Fig. 2): 10 μm / 10 mm
Fig.2  Parallelism at the table center
❷ Allowance of deviation at the table center
Deviation at the table center after stroking the table and 
returning to the same position (see Fig. 3.): 1.5 μm
Fig.3  Deviation at the table center
Accuracy    

❶ Mounting
The fixing thread depth of fixing screws must not exceed the 
maximum fixing thread depth indicated in the dimension 
table. Since the fixing screw hole for the table is penetrated, 
the bed or retainer will be pushed by the screw if the fixing 
thread depth is too deep, and the running accuracy and life 
may be adversely affected.
❷ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the BSU…A series 
to the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 2. 
If the mating member material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, 
reduce the tightening torque depending on the strength 
characteristics of the mating member material.
Table 2  Tightening torque for fixing screw
Tightening torque
M5×0.8
Remark:   The tightening torque is calculated based on property 
division A2-70 of stainless steel hexagon socket head bolt.
Grease is not pre-packed in the BSU…A series, so perform 
adequate lubrication as needed.
Perform cleaning with clean solution before mounting and 
apply high-quality lubrication oil or grease to the raceway 
before use.
❶ Handling
When high running accuracy is required, set the load point 
at the center of the table (or bed) and use with sufficient 
stroke length.
For the BSU…A series, the retainer may be deviated from 
the right position due to offset load or irregular and highvelocity motion, etc. Fully stroke it once in certain operating 
time or certain number of reciprocating motion to correct 
the retainer position.
Since BSU…A series have small allowable load F, handling 
requires special care. Especially when clearance adjustment 
is performed, too much tightening of clearance adjustment 
screw will create impression on ball or way, which can 
adversely affect the friction, noise and vibration of the 
bearing. When performing clearance adjustment, gradually 
rotate the clearance adjustment screw by checking the 
motion status and paying special attention.
❷ Operating temperature
The table and bed of BSU…A series are made of aluminum 
alloy, and the clearance may change by the operating 
temperature. When using in the temperature outside the 
normal temperature, contact IKO. When using in wide 
operating temperature range, it is recommended to use IKO 
High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit.
❸ Maximum velocity
Operating velocity should not exceed 30 m/min during 
operation.

Features of Linear Ball Spline series ①
IKO Linear Ball Spline is a linear motion rolling guide in 
which an external cylinder or slide unit makes linear 
motion along the spline shaft. Since the structure lets a 
ball to rotate on the spline track groove, it can receive 
not only the radial load but also rotating torque. 
Therefore it best ﬁts the structure in which torque 
transmission and linear motion take place in parallel.
Both high speed durability performance and maintenance free performance are achieved
C-lube Linear Ball Spline MAG realizes a long term maintenance free using the built-in lubrication parts C-Lube for 
ball recirculation way in external cylinder. Since the lubrication oil inside C-Lube maintains the lubrication 
performance for a long time, it reduces the annoying lubricating management works and also allows total system 
cost saving by reducing the oil supply structures.
High rigidity despite of compact size
The structure places large diameter balls in two rows 
and has four-point contact with the track, allowing 
greater rigidity and compact design.
Low frictional resistance and smooth motion
The optimum design based on the thorough analysis of 
ball recirculating route realized low frictional resistance 
and smooth linear motion durable for high speed 
operations.
Allows high accuracy and accurate positioning
Preload removes the clearance along the rotation direction, allowing accurate 
positioning along the rotation direction.
Wide variation
A wide variety of models and sizes, such as super miniature size of 2 mm spline shaft diameter, 
block types and limited stroke types, is provided for your selection to meet each requirement.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP Grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in MAG and LSAG series. Additionally, MAG series 
has C-Lube placed in the recirculation part of balls, so that 
the interval for reapplicating lubricant can be extended and 
maintenance works such as grease job can be reduced 
significantly.
Perform re-greasing as below. 
(1) Size 2, 3, and 4 series 
Specify either direct application of grease to the spline shaft 
raceway surface or oil hole specification (/OH). Note that the 
oil hole specification (/OH) is not available for the Size 2 
series. 
(2) Size 5 and higher series 
Apply grease directly to the spline shaft raceway surface or 
the rolling elements. You may also specify the oil hole 
specification (/OH). 
The external cylinders of MAG and LSAG series are equipped 
with special rubber seals as standard for dust protection. 
However, if large amount of contaminant or dust are floating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the spline shaft, it is recommended to 
attach a protective cover to the linear motion mechanism.
The Size 2, 3, and 4 series are not provided with seals. If the 
Size 3 and 4 series with seals is needed, contact IKO.
❶Fitting of external cylinder
Generally, transition fit (J7) is used for fitting between the 
external cylinder and the housing bore. When high accuracy 
and high rigidity are not required, clearance fit (H7) can also 
be used.
❷ Typical mounting structure
Mounting examples of the external cylinder are shown in 
Fig. 1.
The rotation detent for external cylinders of the Size 2, 3, 
and 4 series should be mounted using the countersink 
provided on the external cylinder. Use screws M1.2 to M1.6 
for Size 2, M1.6 to M2 for Size 3, and M2 to M2.5 for Size 4. 
At this point, be careful not to deform the external cylinder 
with screws.
Fig. 1  Mounting examples of external cylinder
❸ Multiple external cylinders used in close proximity
When using multiple external cylinders in close proximity, 
greater load may be applied than the calculated value 
depending on the accuracy of the mounting surfaces and 
reference mounting surfaces of the machine or device. In 
such cases, allowance for greater applied load than the 
calculated value should be made.
If two or more external cylinders are assembled on a spline 
shaft and two or more keys are used to fix the rotational 
direction of the external cylinder, the keyway position of the 
external cylinders are aligned before delivery. Please contact 
IKO.
Rotation detent for external cylinder for size 2, 3 and 4
Mounting example for standard type
(Oil hole /OH speciﬁcation)
Mounting example for ﬂange type
(Oil hole /OH speciﬁcation)
❹ Additional machining of spline shaft end
The spline shaft is hardened by induction hardening. When 
additional machining on the shaft end is needed, make sure 
that the maximum diameter of the shaft end machining part 
does not exceed the dimension d1 in the dimension table.
Spline shafts with special shaft end shapes can be prepared 
upon request. Contact IKO for further information.
❺ Operating temperature
MAG Series contains C-Lube. The operating temperature 
should not exceed 80˚C. The maximum operating 
temperature for LSAG series is 120˚C and temperature up to 
100˚C is allowed for continuous operation. When the 
temperature exceeds 100˚C, contact IKO.
When specifying LSAG series special specification with 
C-Lube plate (supplemental code /Q), utilize it below 80˚C.
❻  Arrangement of flange type (non-interchangeable 
specification) external cylinder
Table 16 shows arrangements of multiple flange type 
external cylinders in non-interchangeable specification. 
Arrangements that are not in Table 16 can be prepared upon 
request. Contact IKO for further information.
Table 16   Arrangement of flange type (Noninterchangeable specification) external cylinder
Number of 
external cylinders
Arrangement of external cylinders





❼  When mounting multiple assembled sets at the same 
time
For interchangeable specification products, assemble an 
external cylinder and a spline shaft with the same 
interchangeable code ("S1" or "S2").
For non-interchangeable specification products, use the 
same combination of external cylinder and spline shaft upon 
delivery.
❽ Assembly of external cylinder on spline shaft
When assembling the external cylinder on the spline shaft, 
correctly fit the grooves of the external cylinder and the 
spline shaft and move the external cylinder softly in parallel 
direction. Rough handling may result in damaging of seals 
or dropping of steel balls.
The non-interchangeable specification products are already 
adjusted so as to provide the best accuracy when the 
 marks of the external cylinder and the spline shaft 
face the same direction (see Fig. 2). Be careful not to change 
the assembly direction.
Fig. 2  Assembly direction of external cylinder
❾ Mounting of external cylinder
When press-fitting the external cylinder to the housing, 
assemble them correctly by using a press and a suitable jig 
fixture. (See Fig. 3.)

❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the LSB, properly align the reference 
mounting surface D of the slide unit with the reference 
mounting surface of the table and fix it. (See Fig. 2)
Outside diameter surface of the spline shaft, reference 
mounting surface D and mounting surface C are precisely 
ground. Machining the mounting surface of the table and 
bed, such as machine or device, to high accuracy and 
mounting them properly will ensure stable linear motion with 
high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the 
 mark. (See Fig. 3)
Fig. 2  Reference mounting surface and typical mounting structure
Fig. 3  Reference mounting surface
❷ Shoulder height of reference mounting surface
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved fillet as indicated in Fig. 4. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height on the mating 
side is indicated in Table 15.
Fig. 4  Corner of the mating reference mounting
Table 15  Shoulder height
❸ Additional machining of spline shaft end
The spline shaft is hardened by induction hardening. When 
additional machining on the shaft end is needed, make sure 
that the maximum diameter of the shaft end machining part 
does not exceed the dimension d1 in the dimension table.
Spline shafts with special shaft end shapes can be prepared 
upon request. Contact IKO for further information.
❹ Multiple slide units used in close proximity
When using multiple slide units in close proximity, greater 
load may be applied than the calculated value depending on 
the accuracy of the mounting surfaces and reference 
mounting surfaces of the machine or device. In such cases, 
allowance for greater applied load than the calculated value 
should be made.
In addition, special products with variation between H and N 
dimensions aligned can be prepared upon request. Contact 
IKO for further information.
❺ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120°C and 
temperature up to 100°C is allowed for continuous 
operation. When the temperature exceeds 100°C, contact 
IKO.
❻  When mounting multiple assembled sets at the same 
time
Assemble a slide unit and a spline shaft with the same 
interchangeable code ("S1" or "S2").
❼ Assembly of slide unit on spline shaft
When inserting a slide unit to the spline shaft, handle with 
care not to pry open the shaft and drop the balls.
❽ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the LSB series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 16. 
When vibration and shock of the machine or device are 
large, fluctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, fix 
it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening 
torque depending on the strength characteristics of the 
mating member material.

M2×0.4

Note （1）  The tightening torque is calculated based on strength 
division 12.9 and property division A2-70.
The slide units of LSB series are equipped with end seals as 
standard for dust protection. However, if large amount of 
contaminant or dust are floating, or if large particles of 
foreign substances such as chips or sand may adhere to the 
spline shaft, it is recommended to attach a protective cover 
to the linear motion mechanism.

● Supports special shapes
We manufacture special shapes to meet the customer's 
uses such as end machining and external cylinder with 
holders. Please ask IKO for your needs.
● Achieved extremely smooth motion
By building the high accuracy retainer into the limited stroke type with small 
recirculation resistance of the balls, a light and smooth motion with extremely small 
ﬂuctuation of frictional resistance even in vertical shaft use has been achieved.
End machining, holder speciﬁcation (example)
● Best for nozzle part for chip mounter

Grease is not pre-packed in the LS series, so please perform 
adequate lubrication as needed.
Upon delivery, anti-rust oil is applied. Therefore, perform cleaning 
with clean solution before mounting and apply high-quality 
lubrication oil or grease before use. For grease lubrication, use of 
high-quality lithium-soap base grease is recommended.
Since no grease nipple or oil hole is provided, apply grease 
directly to the raceway part of the spline shaft when supplying the 
grease.
No dust protection seal is provided for LS series. For 
applications in other than clean environment, cover the 
entire unit with a protective case, etc. to prevent harmful 
foreign substances such as dust and particles from outside 
from entering.
❶ Fitting of external cylinder
Generally, transition fit (J7) is used for fitting between the 
external cylinder and the housing bore. When high accuracy and 
high rigidity are not required, clearance fit (H7) can also be used.
❷ Typical mounting structure
Mounting examples of the external cylinder are shown in Fig. 1.
The rotation detent for external cylinder can be made by using 
the screw hole provided on the external cylinder. The fixing thread 
depth must not exceed the maximum fixing thread depth 
indicated in the dimension table. Since the screw hole for the 
external cylinder is penetrated, the spline shaft or retainer will be 
pushed by the screw if the fixing thread depth is too deep, and 
the running accuracy and life will be adversely affected.
Since there is no built-in mechanical stopper to regulate linear 
motion, install a stopper mechanism in proximity if risk of 
overstroke exists.
Fig. 1  Mounting example
❸ Handling upon operation
Stroke should be used within the effective stroke range 
shown in the dimension table.
The retainer may be deviated from the right position due to 
offset load or irregular and high-velocity motion, etc. Fully 
stroke it once in certain operating time or certain number of 
reciprocating motion to correct the retainer position.
❹ Additional machining of spline shaft end
The spline shaft is hardened by induction hardening. When 
additional machining on the shaft end is needed, make sure 
that the maximum diameter of the shaft end machining part 
does not exceed the dimension d1 in the dimension table.
Spline shafts with special shaft end shapes can be prepared 
upon request. Contact IKO for further information.
❺ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature for LS series is 120°C and 
temperature up to 100°C is allowed for continuous operation. 
When the temperature exceeds 100°C, contact IKO. 
❻ Assembly of external cylinder on spline shaft
When assembling the external cylinder on the spline shaft, 
correctly fit the grooves of the external cylinder and the 
spline shaft and move the external cylinder softly in parallel 
direction. Rough handling may result in dropping of steel 
balls. After assembling, correct the position of the retainer to 
be in the center of the external cylinder. After assembling 
the external cylinder to the housing, insert the shaft softly. 
Move the retainer as well as the shaft until they contact one 
side of the surface and stop. Then push the shaft softly not 
to damage balls or raceway to the position a half of the 
maximum stroke length and return it by the same length (a 
half of the maximum stroke) so that the retainer is positioned 
regularly at the center of the external cylinder.
The products are already adjusted so as to provide the best 
accuracy when the 
 marks of the external cylinder and 
the spline shaft face the same direction. Be careful not to 
change the assembly direction. (See Fig. 2)
Fig. 2  Mounting direction of external cylinder
❼ Mounting of external cylinder
When press-fitting the external cylinder to the housing, 
assemble them correctly by using a press and a suitable jig 
fixture. (See Fig. 3)
Fig. 3  Press-fitting of external cylinder
Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on 
contact surface to which maximum contact stress is applied 
and the sum of whose elastic deformation of rolling elements 
and raceway is small.
Therefore, use applied load within the allowable load range if 
very smooth rolling motion and high accuracy are required.
The LS series must be used with its load rating corrected in 
accordance to the load direction. The basic dynamic load 
rating and basic static load rating shown in the dimension 
table should be corrected to values in Table 7.

To order an assembled set of LMG series, please specify the number of 
sets based on the number of shafts with grooved raceway. For external 
cylinders or single shafts with grooved raceway, please specify the 
number of units.
Grease is not pre-packed in the LMG series, so please 
perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Both oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the LMG series. For grease lubrication, use of high-quality 
lithium-soap base grease is recommended.
No dust protection seal is provided for LMG series. For applications in 
other than clean environment, cover the entire unit with a protective 
case, etc. to prevent harmful foreign substances such as dust and 
particles from outside from entering.
The special specification with end seals (supplemental code / U) has a 
dust protection effect. However, if large amount of contaminant or dust 
are floating, or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the shaft with grooved raceway, it is recommended 
to attach a protective cover to the linear motion mechanism.
❶ Fitting of external cylinder
Generally, clearance fit (H7) is recommended for fitting 
between the external cylinder and the housing bore. The 
transition fit (J7) may be applied for special use.
❷ Typical mounting structure
Mounting examples of the external cylinder are shown in Fig. 1.
The fixing thread depth of mounting screws for the external 
cylinder must not exceed the maximum fixing thread depth 
indicated in the dimension table. Since the screw hole for 
the external cylinder is penetrated, the shaft with grooved 
raceway will be pushed by the screw if the fixing thread 
depth is too deep, and the running accuracy and life will be 
adversely affected.
Fig. 1  Mounting examples of external cylinder
❸ Multiple external cylinders used in close proximity
When using multiple external cylinders in close distance to 
the same housing, it is recommended to ensure that the 
distance between the external cylinders is three times as 
long as the length of the external cylinder. When using 
multiple external cylinders in closer distance, contact IKO.
❹ Loaded condition with rotating torque
Use IKO Linear Ball Spline G under loaded conditions with a 
rotating torque bi-directionally or repeatedly.
❺ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C and 
temperature up to 100˚C is allowed for continuous operation. 
When the temperature exceeds 100˚C, contact IKO.
❻ Mounting of external cylinder
When press-fitting the external cylinder to the housing, 
assemble them correctly by using a press and a suitable jig 
fixture. (See Fig. 2.)

● Wide range of variations for your needs
For each dimensional series, standard, adjustable 
clearance, and open types are available with and without 
seals. You can select an optimal Linear Bushing for the 
speciﬁcations of your machine and device.
● Simple replacement for rolling guide
Since the structure adopts the raceway to be run along 
the shaft, the rolling guide of conventional bushing type 
can be easily modiﬁed to rolling guide without major 
design changes.
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistant to 
corrosion, so that they are suitable for applications where 
rust prevention oil is not preferred, such as in a cleanroom 
environment.
● Stainless steel superior in corrosion

only high class (no symbol) is available, and the 
accuracy values are applicable only before cutting the 
external cylinders.
For details of accuracy, see the dimension table on 
pages Ⅱ-167 to Ⅱ-188.
Note  
（1） It is specification with the dimensions and tolerances generally used in Europe. 

（2） The cage will be always stainless steel even when high carbon steel (no symbol) is specified.

: Product with high accuracy used generally over a wide range
Adjustable clearance type : This type has a cut-away slit in an axial direction of external cylinder, which is capable of clearance adjustment. If 
installed in a housing whose inscribed circle diameter is adjustable, it enables radial clearance to be freely adjusted 
without optional fitting and also enables preloading to operate.
:  This type is in sectoral form with the external cylinder cut away in slit by one-row raceway or two-row raceways of 
ball in an axial direction. In order to avoid the occurrence of long shaft deflection, it is possible to accordingly add 
the shaft support block tailored to (E) dimension of the sectoral form shown in the dimension table, in a midway 
point. And, it is also capable of clearance adjustment.

Grease is not pre-packed in the LM series, so please perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in the LM series. For grease lubrication, 
use of high-quality lithium-soap base grease is recommended.
❶Fitting
For fitting with a housing hole, clearance fit is usually used 
but transition fit can also be used for special usage.
For adjustable clearance type and open type, the shaft 
diameter shall be set as much as possible to less than the 
lower limit of the allowance of the inscribed circle diameter, 
and while the dimension of a housing hole shall be set to 
more than the upper limit of the allowance of the outside 
diameter of the external cylinder.

❷Clearance
For adjustable clearance type and open type, clearance 
adjustment can be easily performed if the unit is mounted 
into a housing with the bore diameter dimension adjustable.
However, if a large preload is produced due to the clearance 
adjustment, the deformation at the contact portion of the 
external cylinder and ball may become large, thereby 
deteriorating the life. Therefore, it is recommended to finish 
the shaft dimension within the allowance of the 
recommended fitting and set the clearance at zero or under 
a slightly-preloaded condition.
Although the clearance adjustment is performed while 
measuring the clearance with a dial gauge after fitting in a 
shaft, a method is generally taken to rotate the shaft under 
unloaded condition during clearance adjustment and stop 
the adjustment at the timing when detecting a slight 
resistance. At this time, the Linear Bushing clearance is at 
zero or under a slight preload condition. Meanwhile, the 
clearance adjustment for open type with three-row ball 
raceways cannot be performed.
Fig. 2  Example of clearance adjustment
❸Raceway
Since LM series operates with a shaft as a raceway surface, 
the shaft should be heat-treated and ground. Recommended 
values for surface hardness and roughness of the shaft are 
shown in Table 3 and the recommended value for the 
minimum effective hardening depth is shown in Table 4.
Table 3  Surface hardness and roughness of shaft
Recommended 
value
Remark
58～64HRC
When the surface hardness is 
low, multiply the load rating by 
hardness factor （1）.
roughness
0.2 μmRa or lower
（0.8 μmRy or lower）
Where accuracy standard is 
low, around 0.8 μmRa  
(3.2 μmRy) is also allowed.
Note （1） For hardness factor, refer to Fig. 3 in page Ⅲ-5.

❹When accompanied by rotational motion
LM series units support only linear motion but do not 
support rotational motion. When performing rotational 
motion and linear motion of short stroke length, 
IKO Stroke Rotary Bushing is recommended to be used. 
And, for the usage requiring rotational motion and linear 
motion of long stroke length, it is recommended to use in 
combination with IKO needle bearing as shown in Fig. 3.

❺ Precaution for use of open type with three-row linear bushing
The open type with three-row Linear Bushing of balls may only 
be used with load direction indicated in Fig. 4.1. In addition, if 
two of them are used in parallel, mount them as indicated in 
4.2, taking into account the load distribution to rolling elements. 
And, note that the clearance adjustment cannot be performed.
Fig. 4.1
Fig. 4.2
❻Operating temperature
If the retainer is made of carbon steel, it can withstand higher 
temperature. However, if you use it in an environment 
exceeding 100˚C, please contact IKO. The maximum operating 
temperature of synthetic resin made products is 100˚C and 
temperature up to 80˚C is allowed for continuous operation.
❼Mounting
When pressing an external cylinder into the housing hole, do is softly 
while applying a jig to the sides of the external cylinder not to hit the 
end plate (see Fig. 5). After pressing-in, use a stop ring or stopper 
plate to fix it in an axial direction. When inserting shaft after mounting 
the external cylinder, be careful not to shock the ball or retainer.
In addition, when two shafts are used, mount one accurately and 
then the other by referring to the first one so as to ensure parallelism 
with it. Typical mounting example is shown in Fig. 6.

Slide shaft
To make full use of performance of the LM series, we also 
offer shaft with high accuracy for Linear Bushing grounded 
after heat treatment. If you are interested, contact IKO.
Conventional ordinary type shafts are also available.
Felt seals for Linear Bushing
Though the type with seal is standardized for the LM series, 
the type without seal and felt seals may be used together 
when emphasis is put on rolling friction resistance. 
Dimensions for felt seals are shown in Table 5.

● Wide variation
As the lineup of two types of external cylinder length are 
available, i.e. standard and long, you can select an optimal 
Linear Bushing for the speciﬁcations of your machine and 
device.
● Compact design
The ultra-small size allows for compact machine and 
device design.
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistant to 
corrosion, so that they are suitable for applications where 
rust prevention oil is not preferred, such as in a cleanroom 
environment.

Relationship between Load Rating and Ball Raceway    
Related Products    

The load rating of LMS series varies according to the loading direction 
and position of ball raceway. The dimension table describes two types of 
values shown in Fig. 1.1 and Fig. 1.2 according to the loading direction 
and position of ball raceway.
Fig. 1.1 shows the case where the loading direction and ball raceway 
position coincides with each other, representing the loading direction A in 
the dimension table. Generally, this is applied when the ball raceway 
position cannot be specified to indeterminate direction load or loading 
direction.
Fig. 1.2 shows the case where the loading direction is positioned between 
ball raceways, representing the loading direction B in the dimension table. 
Generally, this can be subjected to load bigger than loading direction A.

 Miniature Linear Bushing   

Grease is not pre-packed in the LMS series, so please 
perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the LMS series. For grease lubrication, it is typically applied 
lightly to the shaft and each row. Use of high-quality lithiumsoap base grease is recommended for the grease to use.
Shaft for Miniature Linear Bushing
To make full use of performance of the LMS series, we also offer 
shaft with high accuracy for Miniature Linear Bushing grounded 
after heat treatment. If you are interested, contact IKO.
❶ Fitting of external cylinder
Recommended fit for the LMS series is indicated in Table 2. As the external cylinder is 
thin, use epoxy type adhesive agent for fixing to the housing hole, instead of press-fitting.

❷ Raceway
LMS series operates with a shaft as a raceway surface, the shaft should 
be heat-treated and ground. Recommended surface hardness, roughness, 
and minimum effective hardening depth of shaft are indicated in Table 3.
Table 3   Surface hardness, roughness, and effective 
hardening depth of shaft
Recommended value
Remark
58～64HRC
When the surface hardness 
is low, multiply the load 
rating by hardness factor （1）.

（0.8 μmRy or lower）
Effective 
hardening depth 0.8 mm or higher
Note （1） For hardness factor, refer to Fig. 3 in page Ⅲ-5.
❸ When accompanied by rotational motion
LMS series units support only linear motion but do not support rotational 
motion. When performing rotational motion and linear motion of short stroke 
length, IKO Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing is recommended to be used.
❹ Insertion of shaft
When inserting a shaft to the external cylinder, be careful not to let the shaft 
pried open as it may cause dropping of balls or deformation of the retainer.
❺ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C and 
temperature up to 100˚C is allowed for continuous operation. 
When the temperature exceeds 100˚C, contact IKO.

● Small rolling frictional resistance
By building a ball with high accuracy into the precisely 
polished external cylinder, a small rolling frictional 
resistance and extremely smooth rolling motion together 
with reciprocal motion have been achieved.
● Wide variation
Ordinary type and heavy load type with different load 
rating are provided, and each are available with and 
without seals. You can select an optimal product for the 
speciﬁcations of your machine and device.
● Rotational and linear motions
With the combination of an external cylinder with 
cylindrical raceway and balls incorporated in the retainer, 
rotary and linear motion in the axial direction is possible 
simultaneously with rotational motion.
● Small inertia
The retainer has a high rigidity and light weight so that it 
has small motion inertia suitable for rolling motion and 
reciprocal motion in the high-speed operation.

Accuracy    

Grease is not pre-packed in the ST series, so please perform 
adequate lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the ST series. For grease lubrication, use of high-quality 
lithium-soap base grease is recommended. Oil is fed from 
❶ Fitting
Recommended fit for the ST series is indicated in Table 5.
As the ST series performs rotation and rotary and linear 
motion at the same time, the radial internal clearance must 
be smaller when shock load or load accompanied by 
vibration is applied. Especially when vertical axis application 
or high accuracy motion is required, it is recommended to 
set the radial internal clearance at zero or under a slightlypreloaded condition.
Excessive preload will shorten the life, so be careful not to 
set lower limit value of radial internal clearance below the 
value stated in Table 6.

Since ST series operates with a shaft as a raceway surface, 
the shaft should be heat-treated and ground. Recommended 
values for surface hardness and roughness of the shaft are 
shown in Table 7 and the recommended value for the 
minimum effective hardening depth is shown in Table 8.

Remark
58～64HRC
When the surface hardness 
is low, multiply the load 
rating by hardness factor （1）.

（0.8 μmRy or lower）
Where accuracy standard 
is low, around 0.8 μmRa 
(3.2 μmRy) is also allowed.
Note （1） For hardness factor, refer to Fig. 3 in page Ⅲ-5.
Since outside diameter of external cylinder is deformed by 
stop ring tension, calculate the measurement point from the 
equation (1) and use the average diameter value at the point.

Allowance of Velocity    　
The ST series is capable of rotation and rotary and linear 
motion. However, allowance of velocity for these motions 
performed at the same time is obtained from the equation 
(2). Typical values are indicated in Table 4.

❸ Stroke length
For stroke length used, 80% of the maximum stroke length 
stated in the dimension table is recommended.
❹ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C and 
temperature up to 100˚C is allowed for continuous operation. 
When the temperature exceeds 100˚C, contact IKO.
❺ Assembly operation of external cylinder and shaft
When inserting a shaft, be careful not to shock the ball. After 
assembling, correct the position of the retainer to be in the 
center of the external cylinder. After assembling the external 
cylinder to the housing, insert the shaft softly. Move the 
retainer as well as the shaft until they contact one side of 
the surface and stop. Then push the shaft not to damage 
balls or raceway to the position a half of the maximum 
stroke length and return it by the same length (a half of the 
maximum stroke) so that the retainer is positioned regularly 
at the center of the external cylinder.

● Super small size
With the ultra-small sized balls incorporated in a thin 
external cylinder, small diameter and small sectional height 
are realized.
● Extremely smooth operation
Since each component is precisely grounded and 
adjusted to ideal preload condition, extremely smooth and 
stable operation with small frictional resistance for long 
term can be achieved.
● Rotational and linear motions
With the combination of an external cylinder with 
cylindrical raceway and balls incorporated in the retainer, 
rotary and linear motion in the axial direction is possible 
simultaneously with rotational motion.
● Super precision
Balls of high accuracy are incorporated with super-ﬁnished 
external cylinder and shaft to be adjusted to zero or 
minimal amount of preload, which realizes rotational 
motion and rotary and linear motion of high accuracy.

Accuracy    

❶ Fitting
The STSI series is assembled to slight preload state to 
obtain high motion accuracy. Use external cylinder and 
housing hole of the STSI series with clearance fit to avoid 
any effect of press-fitting on inscribed circle diameter. In 
addition, for combination of an external cylinder, a ball cage 
and a shaft, select an external cylinder and a shaft with the 
same selection code to be combined with a ball cage.
❷ Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C and 
temperature up to 100˚C is allowed for continuous operation. 
When the temperature exceeds 100˚C, contact IKO.
❸ Mounting
Typically, to fix the external cylinder and housing hole, the 
external cylinder end is fixed to the axial direction with stop 
ring or adhesive agent is used.
The ball cage is mounted through the shaft after the external 
cylinder is fixed to the housing hole. At this point, mounting 
becomes easier if the ball cage is shifted by one half of 
assembly insertion amount of the shaft in insert direction of 
the shaft so that the ball cage is positioned at the regular 
position after mounting.
❹ Insertion of shaft
When inserting a shaft into an external cylinder, be careful 
not to pry open or give shock to the shaft.

Load rating of the STSI series represents the value obtained 
when load is evenly distributed without the ball incorporated 
in the ball cage being dropped from the external cylinder 
and shaft end.
Load Rating    

Grease is not pre-packed in the STSI series, so please 
perform adequate lubrication as needed.
Both of oil lubrication and grease lubrication are available in 
the STSI series. For grease lubrication, it is typically applied 
lightly to the shaft and raceway of the external cylinder. Use 
of high-quality lithium-soap base grease is recommended 
for the grease to use.

● Superior high speed operation
As the retainers have high rigidity and light in weight with 
low inertia, this series is suitable for abrupt operations 
such as high-speed rotary and linear motion in axial 
direction.
● Long life
Each ball held in the retainer is arranged in a spiral 
formation in order to prevent the balls from tracing the 
same path. Rolling contact fatigue of the shaft and 
housing raceways is thereby minimized, and stable high 
accuracy can be assured for long periods of time.
● Rotational and linear motions
High-accuracy balls incorporated into the retainer make 
use of the raceway accuracy to allow high-accuracy 
rotational motion and rotary and linear motion.
● Large load rating and high rigidity
In the retainer, balls are incorporated as many as possible. 
So the load ratings are large and the rigidity is high with 
small elastic deformation even under ﬂuctuating load or 
offset load.

The specification of BG series is indicated by the identification number. Indicate 
the identification number, consisting of a model code and dimensions.
The BG series is capable of rotation and rotary and linear motion. However, 
allowance of velocity for these motions performed at the same time is 
obtained from the equation (1). Typical values are indicated in Table 1.

❶ Fitting
BG series is generally used with a slight radial internal 
clearance fit. Recommended fits are shown in Table 2.
When it is used for a guide post of the press die set or high 
operation accuracy is required, a preload is generally given. 
The tolerances of dimensions of the shaft and housing bore 
in this case are shown in Table 3. However, since excessive 
preload shortens the life of Stroke Rotary Cage, it is 
suggested that the lower limit of radial clearance is not 
smaller than the value shown in Table 4.

BG series is used with a shaft and housing hole as raceway 
surfaces. Recommended values for surface hardness and 
roughness of mating raceway are shown in Table 5 and the 
recommended values for the minimum effective hardening 
depth are shown in Table 6.
When some of the balls held in the retainer escape the 
housing raceway and operate in linear motion, it is 
recommended that the housing raceway ends should be 
slightly chamfered so that the balls enter or exit smoothly.

● High rigidity and accuracy
Since the high accuracy roller is built into the highly ﬂat surface 
way ﬁnished by accurate ground, the product has a high rigidity 
and high accuracy. Also because the variation of operation 
height can be selected in the unit of 2 μm, the load can be 
evenly distributed even in the multiple-use environment.
The structure of all models lets the roller to be guided 
accurately without creating skew, yielding an extremely

❸ Groove machining on SR and GSN mounting surface
When mounting SR and GSN to the groove-machined 
mounting surface, the groove depth E should be deeper 
than the height from the bottom surface of the way to the 
bottom of the SR and GSN to provide clearance for oil pool. 
(See Fig. 2.)
Other than the above, groove width W corresponding to the 
width W1 for SR should be as wide as clearance fit and the 
relation between the clearance and the groove position on 
the reference surface side must be considered.

● Low section
Flat Roller Cage is a limited linear motion guide consisting 
of high accuracy rollers and a very precise retainers and 
features low cross sectional height which is as high as the 
roller diameter.
● Large load rating
Rollers are assembled in a cage with a small pitch 
distance, so load ratings are large and the rigidity is high.
● Simple replacement for rolling guide
A single row model and a double row model with a 90° are 
standardized and can be easily used to modify the 
conventional plain guide ways of machine tools, etc. into a 
rolling guide type without a large-scale redesign of the bed.
● Smooth operations and low noise
As a retainer processed with high accuracy guides the rollers, 
the frictional resistance is very low without stick-slip, and stable 
linear motion is obtained. Retainers made of synthetic resin are 
most suitable for applications where low noise is required.
● Easy handling
The rollers are caged in a retainer securely, allowing easy 
handling.

Load Rating and Life    

Life of linear motion rolling guides
Even in normal operational status, a linear motion rolling guide 
will reach the end of its life after a certain period of operations. 
As repeated load is constantly applied onto a raceway and 
rolling elements of the linear motion rolling guide, this leads to 
leprous damage (scale-like wear fragments) called fatigue 
flaking due to rolling contact fatigue of materials, it will be 
unusable at the end. Total traveling distance before 
occurrence of this fatigue flaking on a raceway or rolling 
elements is called the life of linear motion rolling guide.
As the life of linear motion rolling guide may vary depending 
on material fatigue phenomenon, rating life based on statistic 
calculation is used.
Rating life
Rating life of linear motion rolling guide refers to the total 
traveling distance （1） 90% of a group of the same linear 
motion rolling guide can operate without linear motion rolling 
guide material damages due to rolling contact fatigue when 
they are operated individually under the same conditions.
Note （1）  Stroke Rotary Bushing is represented as total number of rotations.
Basic dynamic load rating   C
Basic dynamic load rating refers to load with certain 
direction and size that is logically endurable for rating life 
indicated in Table 1 when a group of the same linear motion 
rolling guides is operated individually under the same 
conditions.
Table 1  Load rating
Rating life
100×103m

50×103m

106 rotations
Basic static load rating  C0
Basic static load rating refers to static load generating a 
certain contact stress at the center of contact parts of the 
rolling elements and a raceway under maximum load, which 
is the load at the allowable limit for normal rolling motion. 
Generally, it is used considering static safety factor.
Allowable load  F
Allowable load refers to load of smooth rolling motion on 
contact surface to which maximum contact stress is applied 
and the sum of whose elastic deformation of rolling 
elements and raceway is small.
Therefore, use applied load within the allowable load range 
if very smooth rolling motion and high accuracy are required.
Dynamic torque rating  T
Dynamic torque rating refers to a torque with a certain 
direction and size with which 90% of a group of the same 
linear ball splines can run 50 x 103m without material 
damages due to rolling contact fatigue when they are 
operated individually.
Static torque rating  T0
Static moment rating  T0, TX, TY
Static torque rating and static moment rating refer to static 
torque or moment load generating a certain level of contact 
stress at the center of contact parts of rolling elements and 
a raceway under the maximum load when the torque or 
moment load (see Fig. 1) are loaded, which is the torque or 
moment load at the allowable limit for normal rolling motion. 
Generally, it is used considering static safety factor.
Load direction and load rating
Linear motion rolling guide is used with its load rating 
corrected in accordance to the load direction. Basic 
dynamic load rating and basic static load rating indicated in 
the dimension table should be corrected before use. As the 
values to be corrected vary depending on series, please see 
an explanation for each series.

Calculating formula of life
Rating life and basic dynamic load rating of a linear motion 
rolling guide are correlated as indicated in Table 2.1 and 
Table 2.2.
Temperature factor
As the allowable contact stress is decreased at operating 
temperature above 150°C, the basic dynamic load rating 
should be corrected by the following equation:
Ct=ft C  
  where, Ct	:  Basic dynamic load rating taking into 
account temperature increase,  N

ft	: Temperature factor (see Fig. 2)

C : Basic dynamic load rating,　N
Load factor
Load applied to a linear motion rolling guide can be larger 
than theoretical load due to machine vibration or shock. 
Generally, the applied load is obtained by multiplying it by 
the load factor indicated in Table 3.
Table 3  Load factor

Objectives of preload
In some cases, the linear motion rolling guide is used with clearance given to 
the linear motion rolling guide when light motion with small load is required. 
However, for some applications it may be used with play in the guiding 
mechanism removed or with preload to increase rigidity.
Preload is applied to the contact parts of a raceway and rolling elements with 
internal stress generated in advance. When a external load is applied on the 
preloaded linear motion rolling guide, shock absorbing with this internal stress 
makes elastic deformation smaller, and its rigidity is increased. (See Fig.4)
Preload setting
Preload amount is determined by considering the characteristics of the machines 
or equipments on which the linear motion rolling guide is mounted and the nature 
of load acting on the linear motion rolling guide. The standard amount of preload 
for linear motion rolling guides is, in general, approx. 1/3 of load when the rolling 
elements are balls (steel balls) and approx. 1/2 of load when they are rollers 
(cylindrical rollers). If the linear motion rolling guides are required to have very high 
rigidity to withstand vibration or fluctuating load, a larger preload may be applied.
Precaution for preload selection
Even when high rigidity must be required, excessive preload should be 
avoided, because it will produce an excessive stress between rolling elements 
and raceways, and eventually result in short life of linear motion rolling guides. 
It is important to apply a proper amount of preload, considering the 
operational conditions. When using with a large preload, contact IKO.
Linear Bushing and Stroke Rotary Bushing should never be given a large 
amount of preload.
Hardness factor
Hardness of a raceway must be 58 to 64 HRC. When it is 
lower than 58 HRC, correct basic dynamic load rating by the 
following equation:
CH=fH C  
（2）
  where, CH	:  Basic dynamic load rating taking into 
account the hardness,  N

Static safety factor
Generally, basic static load rating and static moment rating (or static torque rating) 
is considered as load at the allowable limit for normal rolling motion. However, 
static safety factor must be considered according to operating conditions and 
required performance of the linear motion rolling guide.
Static safety factor can be obtained by the following equation and typical values 
are indicated in Table 4.
Equation (4) is a representative equation for moment load or torque. Static moment 
rating and maximum moment load in each direction is applied for the calculation.

Friction    

Friction of linear motion rolling guide
The static friction (start-up friction) of linear motion rolling 
guides is much lower than that of conventional plain guides. 
Also, the difference between static friction and dynamic 
friction is small, and frictional resistance varies little when 
velocity changes. These are excellent features of linear 
motion rolling guides, and account for their ability to reduce 
power consumption, suppress operating temperature rise, 
and increase traveling speed.
Since frictional resistance and variation are small, high 
speed response characteristics to motion commands and 
high accuracy positioning can be achieved.
Friction coefficient
The frictional resistance of linear motion rolling guides varies 
with their model, applied load, velocity and characteristics 
of lubricant. Generally, lubricant or seals are major factors in 
determining the frictional resistance in light load or high 
speed operation, while the amount of load is the major 
factor in heavy load or low speed operation. The frictional 
resistance of linear motion rolling guides depends on various 
factors, but generally the following formula is used.
F＝μP  
（3）
  where,  F : Frictional resistance,  N

μ : Dynamic friction coefficient

P : Applied load,  N
For sealed guides, seal resistance is added to the above 
value, but this resistance varies greatly depending on the 
interference amount of seal lip and lubrication conditions.
Where the lubrication and mounting condition are correct 
and the load is moderate, the friction coefficients of linear 
motion rolling guide in operation are within the range shown 
in Table 5. Generally, friction coefficient is large under small 
load.

Objectives of lubrication
The objectives of applying lubricant for linear motion rolling guides 
is to keep raceways, rolling elements, etc. in a linear motion rolling 
guide from metal contact, and thereby reduce friction and wear 
preventing heat generation and seizure. When an adequate oil film 
is formed at the rolling contact area between the raceways and 
rolling elements, the contact stress due to load can be reduced. 
To manage the formation of adequate oil film is important for 
ensuring the reliability of linear motion rolling mechanism.
Selection of lubricant
To obtain the full performance of linear motion rolling guides, it 
is necessary to select an appropriate lubricant and lubrication 
method by considering the model, load and velocity of each 
linear motion rolling guide. However, as compared with plain 
guides, lubrication of linear motion rolling guides is much 
simpler. Only a small amount of lubrication oil is needed and 
replenishment interval is longer, so maintenance can be greatly 
reduced. Grease and oil are the two most commonly used 
lubricants for linear motion rolling guides.
Grease lubrication　
For linear motion rolling guides, lithium-soap base grease 
(Consistency No.2 of JIS) is commonly used. For rolling 
guides operating under heavy load conditions, grease 
containing extreme pressure additives is recommended.
In clean and high-vacuum environments, where low dust 
generating performance and low vaporization characteristics 
are required, greases containing a synthetic-base oil or a 
soap other than the lithium-soap base are used. For 
applications in these environments, due consideration is 
necessary to select a grease that is suitable for the operating 
conditions of linear motion rolling guide and achieves 
satisfactory lubrication performance at the same time.

Grease replenishment interval
The quality of any grease will gradually deteriorate as operating 
time passes. Therefore, periodic replenishment is necessary. 
Grease replenishment interval varies depending on the operating 
conditions. A six month interval is generally recommended, and 
if the machine operation consists of reciprocating motions with 
many cycles and long strokes, replenishment every three month 
is recommended.
In addition, linear motion rolling guides in which the lubrication 
part "C-Lube" is built deliver long-term maintenance free 
performance. This eliminates the need for lubrication mechanism 
and workload which used to be necessary for linear motion 
rolling guides and significantly reduces maintenance cost.
Grease replenishment method
New grease must be supplied through a grease feed device 
such as a grease nipple until old grease is discharged. After 
grease is replenished, running-in is performed and excess 
grease will be discharged to outside of the linear motion rolling 
guide. Discharged grease must then be removed before 
starting the operation.
The amount of grease required for standard replenishment is 
about 1/3 to 1/2 of the free space inside the linear motion 
rolling guide. When grease is supplied from a grease nipple for 
the first time, there will be grease lost in the replenishment 
path. The amount lost should be taken into consideration.
Generally, immediately after grease is replenished, frictional 
resistance tends to increase. If additional running-in is 
performed for10 to 20 reciprocating cycles after excess grease 
is discharged, frictional resistance becomes small and stable.
For applications where low frictional resistance is required, the 
replenishment amount of grease may be reduced, but it must 
be kept to an appropriate level so as not to give a bad 
influence on the lubrication performance.
Mixing of different type of grease
Mixing different types of grease may result in changing the 
properties of base oil, soap base, or additives used, and, in 
some cases, severely deteriorate the lubrication 
performance or cause trouble due to chemical changes of 
additives. Old grease should therefore be removed 
thoroughly before filling with new grease.
Oil lubrication
For oil lubrication, heavy load requires high oil viscosity and 
high velocity requires low oil viscosity. Generally, for linear 
motion rolling guides operating under heavy load, lubrication 
oil with a viscosity of about 68 mm2/s is used. For linear 
motion rolling guides under light load at high speed 
operation, lubrication oil with a viscosity of about 13 mm2/s 
is used.
Lubrication part "C-Lube"
C-Lube Linear Ball Spline MAG has built-in lubrication part, 
"C-Lube".
C-Lube is a porous resin with molding formed fine resin 
powder. It is a lubrication part impregnated with a large 
amount of lubrication oil in its open pores by capillary inside.
Lubrication oil is supplied directly to balls (steel balls), not to 
the spline shaft. When the balls have contact with C-Lube 
built in the external cylinder, lubrication oil is supplied to the 
surface of the balls. As the steel balls circulate, the lubricant 
is distributed to the loading area along the track rail. This 
results in adequate lubrication oil being properly maintained 
in the loading area and lubrication performance will last for a 
long time.
The surface of C-Lube is always covered with the lubrication 
oil. Lubrication oil is continuously supplied to the surface of 
steel balls by surface tension in the contact of C-Lube 
surface and steel balls.

Introduction of Technical Service Site
"IKO Technical Service Site" can be accessed from our home page. The site provides various tools for 
selecting Linear Ways and Linear Roller Ways. Please utilize these tools for assistance when selecting 
products. Additionally the site also provides CAD data and product catalogs for the Needle Series, 
Linear Motion Rolling Guide Series, and Mechatronics Series for download. Please utilize them to 
improve your design efﬁciency.
1. Technical calculations
For Linear Way/Linear Roller Way load and life calculation, you 
can obtain the calculated load and the rating life by entering the 
operating conditions. Also you can derive the motor torque 
required for operation and the effective thrust force during operation in the sections of motor torque calculation and calculation 
of effective thrust force of linear motor tables respectively, and 
output the calculation results in PDF format, as well as save the 
histories.
2. Selection of Identiﬁcation Number
By selecting such speciﬁcation as model code, dimensions, part code, material 
code, preload symbol, classiﬁcation symbol, interchangeable code and 
supplemental code of Linear ways/Linear roller ways, you can easily specify 
the identiﬁcation number used for ordering.
Also you can browse the CAD data of the selected products, calculate the load, 
and output the selection results in PDF format, as well as save the histories.
4. Downloading Catalog and Operation Manual
3. Downloading CAD data
There are two types of ﬁgures, brief ﬁgure and detailed ﬁgure. The 
brief ﬁgure shows only the external view lines, and the detailed 
ﬁgure shows the detailed lines. The drawing consists of three 
drawings: front view, side view and plain view. The scale shows 
only the original size (1:1), and it does not show dimension lines.
2-dimensional CAD data (DXF ﬁle)
It is linked to the mechanical parts CAD library 
"PART community". Entering the rail dimension 
and option contents to the detail, you can view 
the 2D/3D CAD data suitable for the speciﬁcation 
for free of charge.
3-dimensional CAD data
You can download product catalogs of needle series, linear motion rolling guide series and mechatronics 
series, operation manuals of precision positioning tables and various electrical components in PDF format, 
as well as support software for precision positioning tables. If you would like a copy of our catalog, please 
visit the IKO ofﬁcial website and apply for the catalog, or contact our regional ofﬁce or sales ofﬁce nearby.

Gentle to The Earth
Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. is working to develop global environment-friendly products. 
It is committed to developing products that make its customers’ machinery and 
equipment more reliable, thereby contributing to preserving the global environment. 
This development stance manifests well in the keyword “Oil Minimum.” 
Our pursuit of Oil Minimum has led to the creation of
IKO’s proprietary family of lubricating parts as “C-Lube.”
Products Underpin Sustain
Technology Leaps
Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. was the ﬁrst Japanese manufacturer to develop 
needle bearings on its own and has since expanded into the arena of linear 
motion rolling guides (Linear Motion Series and Mechatro Series) on the 
support of its advanced expertise. The company now offers a vast assortment 
of ingenious products, including the world’s ﬁrst C-Lube Maintenance-Free 
Series, to address increasingly diversiﬁed customer needs and thus sustain 
technology leaps.
C-Lube Maintenance-Free Series Products 
Evolving from the “Oil Minimum” Concept
We have developed lubricating parts impregnated with a large amount of 
lubricant as C-Lube Series to save the customer’s oiling management workload 
and built them into bearings and linear motion rolling guides.
The C-Lube Series not only keeps products maintenance-free for long by giving 
them an optimal and minimal amount of a lubricant for an extended period of 
time but also contributes greatly to preserving the global environment.

          Gentle to The Earth
Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. is working to develop global 
environment-friendly products.
It is committed to developing products that make its 
customer's machinery and equipment more reliable, 
thereby contributing to preserving the global environment.
This development stance manifests well in the keyword 
"Oil Minimum".
"C-Lube" minimizes usage of lubrication oil and supplies the 
optimal amount of lubrication oil for long period of time. So it 
realizes long term maintenance free and contributes to the 
global environment preservation.
Interchangeable is a collective name of "systems of products selection 
from users' perspective" which allows free interchange and replacement 
totally retaining the accuracy and preload of slide units and track rails.
Our pursuit of Oil Minimum has led to the creation of           ’s 
proprietary family of lubricating parts as "C-Lube".
The "Interchangeable" is a result of our  consideration 
to the environment and radical pursuit of 
elimination of material and inventory waste.
The integration of maintenance free and 
advanced interchangeable system with 
C-Lube is the "Free & Interchangeable".

The surface of capillary lubricating element is always covered 
with the lubrication oil.
Lubrication oil is continuously supplied to the surface of 
rolling elements by surface tension in the contact of capillary 
lubricating element surface and rolling elements.
On the surface of capillary lubricating element with which the 
rolling elements make contact, new lubrication oil is always 
supplied from the other sections.
The lubrication oil is supplied directly to the rolling elements, 
not to the track rail.
When rolling elements make contact with the capillary lubricating element integrated with the circulation path of slide 
unit rolling elements, the lubrication oil is supplied to 
surfaces of rolling elements and carried to the loading area 
through circulation of rolling elements.
This results in adequate lubrication oil being properly maintained in the loading area and lubrication performance will 
last for a long time.

Driving force follow-up property is superior and 
energy is saved by improvement of accuracy and 
reduction of friction loss.
As C-Lube Linear Way and C-Lube Linear Roller 
Way are integrated with lubrication part C-Lube, 
their slide units are not long unlike types with

The Linear Roller Way Super X prevents skew of cylindrical 
roller and achieves smooth motion by adopting unique retaining method to accurately guide cylindrical roller ends with 
retaining plate.
The Linear Roller Way Super X has good response characteristics to micro-feeding and allows for accurate positioning, 
thanks to small frictional resistance against preload and load 
and excellent frictional characteristics relative to plain guides 
and ball type linear motion rolling guide.

● Wide range of variations for your needs
The slide unit shape can be selected from two types, the 
standard type and the wide type suited for single-row 
track rail uses, and there are four types with different 
lengths of slide unit with same section. Furthermore, the 
track rail has the variation of standard type and tapped rail 
type with the screw thread implanted, allowing you to 
select an optimal product for the speciﬁcations of your 
machine and device.
Super small-size linear motion rolling guide produced by 
two-row four-point contact simple structure and original 
small sizing technology. The track rail width of LWL1, the 
smallest size, is only 1mm.
● Ball retained type for easy operation
The slide unit of ball retained type incorporates the ball 
retaining band, which prevents the ball from dropping 
down when the slide unit is removed from the track rail.
This safety structure brings you an easy operation to the 
machines / equipment.
Stainless steel highly corrosion-resistant is used as the 
basic speciﬁcation, so that the products are suitable for 
applications where rust prevention oil is not preferred, 
such as in cleanroom environment. High carbon steel 
products suited to general purposes are also provided.
● Widely supports special environment uses
C-Lube Linear Way L for special environment uses are 
provided as a series. Increasingly varied special environment 
uses are supported, such as by high-speed / low-noise 
speciﬁcations by combining silicon nitride ceramics and low 
dust-generation speciﬁcations.

ー Special Speciﬁcation ー

Lithium-soap base grease (MULTEMP PS No.2 [KYODO YUSHI 
CO., LTD.]) is pre-packed in ML(F) and LWL(F) series. 
Additionally, ML(F) series has C-Lube placed in the recirculation 
part of balls, so that the interval for reapplicating lubricant can 
be extended and maintenance works such as grease job can 
be reduced signiﬁcantly.
ML(F) series and LWL(F) series have grease nipple or oil hole as 
indicated in Table 14. Since the Size 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 series do 
not have an oil hole, apply grease directly to the raceway part 
of the track rail for re-greasing. Supply nozzles fit to each 
shapes of grease nipple and dedicated supplying equipment 
(miniature greasers) ﬁt to oil holes are also available. For order 
of these parts for lubrication, see Table 13 and Table 14.1 on 
Page Ⅲ－23, and Table 15 on page Ⅲ－24.
The slide units of ML(F) series and LWL(F) series are 
equipped with end seals as standard for dust protection. 
However, if large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to 
attach a protective cover to the linear motion mechanism.
No end seal is provided for size 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 series. For 
applications in the environment not clean enough, cover the 
entire unit with a protective case, etc. to prevent harmful 
foreign substances such as dust and particles from outside 
to enter.

❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
general mounting structure
When mounting the ML(F) series and LWL(F) series, properly 
align the reference mounting surfaces B and D (D1 or D2)of 
the track rail and slide unit with the reference mounting 
surface of the table and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 2)
Reference mounting surfaces B and D (D1 or D2) and 
mounting surfaces A and C are precisely ground. By 
machining the mounting surface of the mating member, 
such as machine or device, to high accuracy and mounting 
them properly, stable linear motion with high accuracy is 
obtained.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit of size 2 or 
higher is the opposite side of the 
 mark. The track rail 
reference mounting surface is identified by locating the 
 mark on the top surface of the track rail. It is the side 
surface above the mark (in the direction of the arrow). (See 
Fig. 5.2)
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit of size 1 is 
located at both right and left sides (D1 and D2). (See Fig. 
5.1)
The track rail of LWL1…Y has the mounting structure of 
lateral direction. Two types of mounting structure as shown 
in Fig. 3.1 and Fig. 3.2 are available.

❷ Mounting screws for slide unit
To mount a slide unit, tightly fasten the bolt against female 
thread of slide unit.
The female thread is created through holes of the slide unit 
for size 1 series, and also through holes for the slide unit 
and track rail for size 2, 3, 4 and 6 series. When the ﬁxing 
thread depth of the mounting screw goes too deep, it can 
interfere with the track rail and impact the running accuracy 
or product life so that the fixing thread depth should be 
within the screwing depth speciﬁed in the dimension table.
Also prepare the small screws dedicated to precision 
devices (head diameter 1.8 mm or smaller) for the mounting 
bolt of slide unit of size 1.
❸ Mounting screws for track rail
In the size 2 and 3 series and tapped rail specifications, 
track rail mounting bolts are not appended. Prepare 
mounting bolts whose ﬁxing thread depth is less than H4 in 
dimension table.
❹  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 6 
Recommended value for the shoulder height on the mating 
side is indicated in Table 16.
Fig. 6  Corner of the mating reference mounting
❺ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting ML(F) series and 
LWL(F) series to the steel mating member material is 
indicated in Table 15. When vibration and shock of the 
machine or device are large, fluctuating load is large, or 
moment load is applied, ﬁx it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 
times larger than the value indicated in the table as 
necessary. If the mating member material is cast iron or 
aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening torque depending on 
the strength characteristics of the mating member material.

Remarks 1.  The tightening torque is calculated based on strength 
division 8.8 and property division A2-70.

2.  It is recommended that the tightening torque of slide 
unit mounting holes for series size 1 is to be 70 to 80 % 
of the values in the table.

Super small-size linear motion rolling guide produced by 
two-row four-point contact simple structure and original 
small sizing technology.
● Extremely small size realized by simple 
structure
● Cost performance
● Ball retained type for easy operation
● Stainless steel selections for excellent 
corrosion resistance
● Long term maintenance free
The built-in "C-Lube", the capillary lubricating element, in 
the ball circulation pipes of the slide unit makes it long 
term maintenance free.
Lubrication oil is continuously supplied to the surface of 
rolling elements by surface tension in the contact of the 
capillary lubricating element surface and rolling elements.
Preserving the basic performance of C-Lube Linear Way 
ML as is, lower cost has been achieved by reviewing the 
structure including the ball recirculation part.
The slide unit incorporates the ball retaining band, which 
prevents the ball from dropping down when the slide unit 
is removed from the track rail. This safety structure brings 
you an easy operation to the machines/equipment.
Stainless steel highly corrosion-resistant is used as the 
basic speciﬁcation, so that the products are suitable for 
applications where rust prevention oil is not preferred, 
such as in cleanroom environment.

Lithium-soap base grease (MULTEMP PS No.2 [KYODO 
YUSHI CO., LTD.]) is pre-packed in MLV series. Additionally, 
MLV series has C-Lube placed in the recirculation part of 
balls, so that the interval for reapplicating lubricant can be 
extended and maintenance works such as grease job can 
be reduced signiﬁcantly.
MLV series have an oil hole. (See Table 5)
Dedicated supplying equipment (miniature greasers) ﬁt to oil 
holes are also available. For order of these parts for 
lubrication, see Table 13 on Page Ⅲ－23.
No end seal is provided for the MLV series. For applications 
in other than clean environment, cover the whole unit with a 
protective case, etc. to prevent harmful foreign substances 
such as dust and particles from entering.
We can also attach end seals (supplemental code "/US") on 
both sides of the slide unit. If needed, indicate the 
supplemental code.
Even with the use of the end seals to prevent dust from 
entering, if large amount of contaminants or dust are ﬂoating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to 
attach a protective cover to the linear motion mechanism.
❶ Handling
A strong grip on the circulation pipes of the MLV series slide 
unit, will distort the circulation path, which may affect the 
operating performance; handle with care.
❷  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the MLV series, properly align the reference 
mounting surfaces B and D of the track rail and the slide 
unit with the reference mounting surface of the table and the 
bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig.2)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the upper 
surface when you see the 
 mark on the C surface in 
normal position. The track rail reference mounting surface is 
identiﬁed by locating the 
 mark on the top surface of 
the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark (in the 
direction the arrow point). (See Fig.3)
Fig. 2  Reference mounting surface and typical mounting structure
Fig. 3  Reference mounting surface
❸  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 4. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height on the mating 
side is indicated in Table 6.

❹ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the MLV series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 7. 
When vibration and shock of the machine or device are 
large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx 
it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening 
torque depending on the strength characteristics of the 
mating member material.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in MV series. Additionally, MV series has C-Lube 
placed in the recirculation part of balls, so that the interval 
for reapplicating lubricant can be extended and 
maintenance works such as grease job can be reduced 
signiﬁcantly.
MV series has grease nipple as indicated in Table 11. Supply 
nozzles fit to each shapes of grease nipple are also 
available. When these parts are desired, see Tables 14.1 and 
14.2 on page Ⅲ-23 and Table 15 on page Ⅲ-24 to order.
The slide units of MV series are equipped with end seals as 
standard for dust protection. However, if large amount of 
contaminant or dust are floating, or if large particles of 
foreign substances such as chips or sand may adhere to the 
track rail, it is recommended to cover the whole unit with 
bellows or telescope type shield, etc.
It is also effective to apply special specifications such as 
caps for rail mounting holes, under seal, double end seals 
and scrapers according to the use environment.
❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the MV series, properly align the reference 
mounting surface B and D of the track rail and slide unit with 
the reference mounting surface of the table and bed and ﬁx 
them. (See Fig.2)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the 
 mark. The track rail reference mounting 
surface is identiﬁed by locating the 
 mark on the top 
surface of the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark 
(in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig.3)

For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig.4. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height and corner 
radius on the mating side is indicated in Table 12.

❸ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the MV series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 13.
When vibration and shock of the machine or device are 
large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx 
it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening 
torque depending on the strength characteristics of the 
mating member material.

● Wide range of variations for your needs
As two shapes of slide unit, ﬂange type and block type 
(with small width) and 3 types with different slide unit 
length with same section are available, you can select an 
optimal product for the speciﬁcations of your machine and 
device.
● Compact and versatile series with utility
Versatile linear motion rolling guide that has achieved utility 
pursuing compactness in every aspect.
● Stainless steel selections superior in corrosion 
     resistance are listed on lineup.
P.Ⅰ-39
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistant to 
corrosion, so that they are suitable for applications where 
rust prevention oil is not preferred, such as in cleanroom 
environment.
● Achieved smooth and quiet motion 
Due to resin separator built-in balls, Low Decibel Linear Way 
E achieved smooth and quiet motion by eliminating of direct 
contact of balls each other. This feature reduces noise level 
in factory and contributes to a human-friendly environment.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in ME and LWE (…Q) series. Additionally, ME series 
has C-Lube placed in the recirculation part of balls, so that 
the interval for reapplicating lubricant can be extended and 
maintenance works such as grease job can be reduced 
signiﬁcantly.
ME and LWE (…Q) series have grease nipple as indicated in 
Table 15. Supply nozzles ﬁt to each shapes of grease nipple 
are also available. For order of these parts for lubrication, 
see Table 14.1 on page Ⅲ－23 and Table 15 on page Ⅲ－24.
The slide units of ME and LWE (…Q) series are equipped 
with end seals as standard for dust protection. However, if 
large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, or if large 
particles of foreign substances such as chips or sand may 
adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to cover the 
whole unit with bellows or telescope type shield, etc.
ME series and LWE (…Q)  series are provided with speciﬁc 
bellows. The bellows are easy to mount and provide excellent 
dust protection. If needed, please refer to Ⅲ－26 for ordering.
❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface, and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the ME and LWE (…Q) series, properly align the 
reference mounting surface B and D of the track rail and slide unit with 
the reference mounting surface of the table and bed and ﬁx them. (See 
Fig. 2)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting surfaces A and 
C are precisely ground. Machining the mounting surface of the table and 
bed, such as machine or device, to high accuracy and mounting them 
properly will ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite side of the 
 mark. The track rail reference mounting surface is identiﬁed by 
locating the 
 mark on the top surface of the track rail. It is the side 
surface above the mark (in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig. 3.)

❷  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 4. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height on the mating 
side is indicated in Table 17.
Fig. 4  Corner of the mating reference mounting
❸ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the ME and LWE (…Q) 
series to the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 
16. When vibration and shock of the machine or device are large, 
ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx it by using 
the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value indicated in the 
table as necessary. If the mating member material is cast iron 
or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening torque depending on 
the strength characteristics of the mating member material.

● Wide range of variations for your needs
As the lineup of 5 types of slide unit shape including the 
ﬂange type, block type with small width and side mounting 
type, etc., and 3 types with different slide unit length with 
same section are available, you can select an optimal 
product for the speciﬁcations of your machine and device.
High rigidity linear motion rolling guides designed to evenly 
support high load capacity by incorporating large-diameter 
balls.
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistant to 
corrosion, so that they are suitable for applications where 
rust prevention oil is not preferred, such as in cleanroom 
environment.
Products of ultra seal speciﬁcations have excellent dust 
protection performance thanks to the combination of the 
dedicated track rail ﬁnished with total ground and slide unit 
with end seal and under seal of special shapes. Special 
speciﬁcation with inner seal further improves dust 
protection property of the ball circulation section against 
foreign substances from the upper surface of the track rail.
C-Lube Maintenance Free Series

The aquamarine end plate is the 
symbol of maintenance free.
long term maintenance free supported!
● Series of ultra seal speciﬁcation for 
excellent dust protection performance
● High rigidity series with the largest-class load 
rating among ball types
● Stainless steels selections superior in corrosion 
resistance are listed on lineup.

For applicable models and sizes, see Table 1.1 and Table 1.2.
Each speciﬁcation of ultra seal speciﬁcation with track rail mounting 
from bottom is in compliance to the ultra seal speciﬁcation.
Ultra seal speciﬁcation with track rail mounting from bottom applies 
to products to ﬁx the track rail on the mounting surface side by 
pressing in the aluminum alloy caps for rail mounting holes to the 
mounting hole of the track rail in advance. As the upper surface of 
the track rail is ﬂat, adhesion to the seal is high and dust protection 
effect is improved further.
For track rail speciﬁcations, see Table 2.3 and Table 2.4.

YUSHI) is pre-packed, and in the series of size 15 to 65, 
lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP grease 2, [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked. Additionally, MH series has C-Lube placed in the 
recirculation part of balls, so that the interval for 
reapplicating lubricant can be extended and maintenance 
works such as grease job can be reduced signiﬁcantly.
MH series and LWH series have grease nipple or oil hole as 
indicated in Table 15. Supply nozzles ﬁt to each shapes of 
grease nipple and dedicated supplying equipment (miniature

The slide units of MH series and LWH series are equipped with 
end seals and under seals as standard for dust protection. 
However, if large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to cover 
the whole unit with bellows or telescope type shield, etc.
MH series and LWH series are provided with speciﬁc bellows. 
The bellows are easy to mount and provide excellent dust 
protection. If needed, please refer to Ⅲ－26 for ordering.
And, track rail mounting from bottom with no mounting hole 
on the upper surface of the track rail (Figure 3) is also 
available. If needed, contact IKO.
❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the MH series and LWH series, properly align 
the reference mounting surfaces B and D of the track rail and 
slide unit with the reference mounting surface of the table 
and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 4.)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the
 mark. The track rail reference mounting 
surface is identified by locating the
 mark on the top 
surface of the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark 
(in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig. 5.)
❷  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 6. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height and corner 
radius on the mating side is indicated in Table 16.
❸ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the MH series and 
LWH series to the steel mating member material is indicated 
in Table 17. When vibration and shock of the machine or 
device are large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is 
applied, ﬁx it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than 
the value indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating 
member material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the 
tightening torque depending on the strength characteristics 
of the mating member material.

● Slide unit shapes for various usage
As the lineup of three types of slide unit shape including  
two ﬂange types with different dimensional series and 
block type with small width are available, you can select 
an optimal product for the speciﬁcations of your machine 
and device.
● Wide rail type series resistant to moment load
As track rail width is wide and distance between moment 
load points is long, this is a linear motion rolling guide 
resistant to moment load and complex load and suitable 
for serial use.
Products made of stainless steel are highly resistant to 
corrosion, so that they are suitable for applications where 
rust prevention oil is not preferred, such as in a cleanroom 
environment.
● Stainless steel selections superior in corrosion 
     resistance are listed on lineup.

❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the LWF series, properly align the reference 
mounting surface B and D of the track rail and slide unit with 
the reference mounting surface of the table and bed and ﬁx 
them. (See Fig. 3.)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the
mark. The track rail reference mounting 
surface is identified by locating the
mark on the top 
surface of the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark 
(in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig. 4)

❷  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it 
is recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 5. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height and corner 
radius on the mating side is indicated in Table 17.1 and 
Table 17.2.
Fig. 5  Corner of the mating reference mounting
❸ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the LWF series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 16. 
When vibration and shock of the machine or device are 
large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx 
it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening 
torque depending on the strength characteristics of the 
mating member material.

Because of the high rigidity of the track rail, the track rail 
can be used as a structure beam, such as a cantilever or 
both-end support in the machine and equipment. 
Therefore, freedom of design is expanded for user.
● Original U-shaped track rail
MUL and LWU series are the linear motion rolling guides 
adopting the U-shaped track rail to greatly increase rigidity 
of track rail under moment load and torsion.
● Additional machining available for 
corresponding to needs
High carbon steel track rail can be machined additionally 
to ﬁx mechanical components such as a driving 
mechanism on the track rail directly at user.
The main metal components made of corrosion-resistant 
stainless steel are available for small size of 25 mm and 30 mm 
of track rail width. They are suitable for applications where rust 
prevention oil is not preferred, such as in a cleanroom 
environment.

Moment of Inertia of Sectional Area    

High rigidity design of C-Lube Linear Way MUL and LWU 
are achieved by adopting a U-shaped track rail. The moment 
of inertia of sectional area of track rails are shown in Table 9.
In the MUL series, lithium soap base grease (MULTEMP PS 
No.2, KYODO YUSHI) is prepacked, and in the LWU…B 
series, lithium soap base grease with extreme-pressure 
additive (Alvania EP grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. 
K.]) is prepacked. Additionally, MUL series has C-Lube 
placed in the recirculation part of balls, so that the interval 
for reapplicating lubricant can be extended and 
maintenance works such as grease job can be reduced 
signiﬁcantly.
MUL series and LWU series have grease nipple or oil hole as 
indicated in Table 11. Supply nozzles ﬁt to each shapes of 
grease nipple and dedicated supplying equipment (miniature 
greasers) ﬁt to oil holes are also available. For order of these 
parts for lubrication, see Table 13 and Table 14.1 on page

The slide units of MUL series and LWU series are equiped 
with end seals and upper seals as standard for dust 
protection. However, if large amount of contaminant or dust 
are ﬂoating, or if large particles of foreign substances such 
as chips or sand may adhere to the track rail, it is 
recommended to attach a protective cover to the linear 
motion mechanism. 
❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the MUL series and LWU series, properly 
align the reference mounting surfaces B and D of the track 
rail and slide unit with the reference mounting surface of the 
table and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 2)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surfaces of slide unit and track rail of 
the MUL series and LWU series are the opposite side of the 
 mark. (See Fig. 3)

❸ Tightening torque for ﬁxing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the MUL series and 
LWU series to the steel mating member material is indicated 
in Table 12. When vibration and shock of the machine or 
device are large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is 
applied, ﬁx it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than 
the value indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating 
member material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the 
tightening torque depending on the strength characteristics 
of the mating member material.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in MX series and LRX series. Additionally, MX series 
has C-Lube placed in the recirculation part of cylindrical 
roller, so that the interval for reapplicating lubricant can be 
extended and maintenance works such as grease job can 
be reduced signiﬁcantly.
MX series and LRX series have grease nipple or oil hole as 
indicated in Table 15. Supply nozzles ﬁt to each shapes of 
grease nipple and dedicated supplying equipment (miniature 
greasers) ﬁt to oil holes are also available. For order of these 
parts for lubrication, see Table 13 and Table 14.1 on Page

The slide units of MX series and LRX series are equipped with 
end seals and under seals as standard for dust protection. 
However, if large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to cover 
the whole unit with bellows or telescope type shield, etc.
MX series and LRX series are provided with speciﬁc bellows. 
The bellows are easy to mount and provide excellent dust 
protection. If needed, please refer to Ⅲ－26 for ordering.
Also the rail cover sheet to cover the mounting hole of track 
rail (Fig. 3) and track rail mounting from bottom with no 
mounting hole on the upper surface (Fig. 4) are available. If 
needed, please contact IKO.

❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the MX series and LRX series, properly align 
the reference mounting surfaces B and D of the track rail 
and slide unit with the reference mounting surface of the 
table anend bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 5.)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable liar motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the
 mark. The track rail reference mounting 
surface is identiﬁed by locating the
 mark on the top 
surface of the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark 
(in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig. 6.)
Fig. 5  Reference mounting surface and typical mounting structure
Fig. 6  Reference mounting surface
❷ Fixing the slide unit
Slide unit is also provided with mounting holes in the middle of 
width direction (see Fig. 7) and some products have the 
arrangement to receive the applied load in a good balance. When 
designing machines or equipment, consider the arrangement so 
that the mounting holes in the middle of slide unit can also be used 
to ﬁx the units, to use the highest performance out of the product.
To ﬁx the slide unit of compact block type or low proﬁle block type, 
we recommend to secure the ﬁxing thread depth of Table 16.1and 
Table 16.2. Also, with the low proﬁle ﬂange type and low proﬁle 
block type, make sure that the ﬁxing thread depth for the mounting 
screw in the middle of slide unit width direction should be less than 
the maximum ﬁxing thread depth of the dimension table.

❸  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference mounting surface
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it is 
recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 8, but 
you may also use it with providing corner radius R as shown 
in Table 17. Recommended value for the shoulder height and 
corner radius on the mating side is indicated in Table 17.

❹ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the MX series and LRX 
series to the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 
18. When vibration and shock of the machine or device are large, 
ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx it by using 
the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value indicated in the 
table as necessary. If the mating member material is cast iron or 
aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening torque depending on the 
strength characteristics of the mating member material.

Remarks 1.  The tightening torque is calculated based on strength 
division 12.9 for product size 12 to 65, strength division 
10.9 for product sizes 85 and 100, and property division 
A2-70 for stainless steel bolts.
2.  It is recommended that the tightening torque of slide 
unit middle mounting holes for size 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 of 
ﬂange type (MXC, MX, MXG, MXL, LRXC, LRX, LRXG) 
is to be 70 to 80% of the values in the table.
❺ Remarks
・ As LRX(D)(G,L)85 and LRXG100 are heavyweight 
products, we recommend the use of eyebolts for 
transport and assembly. For eyebolt mounting, use the 
slide unit mounting holes and the track rail female threads 
for eyebolts (Fig. 9). For the LRXG100 track rail, also use 
the LRXG100 track rail dedicated eyebolt adapter (Fig. 10).
・ LRX(D)(G,L)85 slide unit eyebolts (JIS B1168 M20) and 
LRX85 track rail dedicated eyebolts (Fig. 11) are not 
appended. If needed, please contact IKO.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP Grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in LRWX series.
The slide units of LRWX series are equipped with end seals 
and under seals as standard for dust protection. However, if 
large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, or if large 
particles of foreign substances such as chips or sand may 
adhere to the track rail, it is recommended to cover the 
whole unit with bellows or telescope type shield, etc.
LRWX series is provided with speciﬁc bellows. The bellows 
are easy to mount and provide excellent dust protection. If 

❶Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the LRWX series, properly align the 
reference mounting surfaces B and D of the track rail and 
slide unit with the reference mounting surface of the table 
and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 3)
Reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are ground precisely. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Reference mounting surface of the slide unit is the opposite 
side of the 
 mark. The track rail reference mounting 
surface is identified by locating the 
 mark on the top 
surface of the track rail. It is the side surface above the mark 
(in the direction of the arrow). (See Fig. 4)
❷Fixing the slide unit
Slide unit of LRWX25… B and LRWXH is also provided with 
mounting holes in the middle of width direction (see Fig. 5) 
and has the arrangement to receive the applied load in a 
good balance. When designing machines or equipment, 
consider the arrangement so that the mounting holes in the 
middle of slide unit can also be used to ﬁx the units, to use 
the highest performance out of the product.
Fig. 5  Slide unit middle mounting hole
❸Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it is 
recommended to have relieved ﬁllet as indicated in Fig. 6, but 
you may also use it with providing corner radius R as shown in 
Table 11. Recommended value for the shoulder height and 
corner radius on the mating side is indicated in Table 11.

❹Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of the LRWX series to 
the steel mating member material is indicated in Table 12. 
When vibration and shock of the machine or device are 
large, ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx 
it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening 
torque depending on the strength characteristics of the 
mating member material.

division 10.9 for product size 75.

Lithium-soap base grease with extreme-pressure additive 
(Alvania EP Grease 2 [SHOWA SHELL SEKIYU K. K.]) is prepacked in Linear Way Module series.
Though grease nipples are not appended to Linear Way 
Module series, oil holes are provided to slide member so that 
the grease or lubrication oil supplied from machines / 
devices is directly guided to the rolling elements recirculation 
route. Lubrication is easily conducted by providing the 
supply route in the machines / devices as shown in Fig. 3.
The slide members of Linear Way Module series are equipped 
with end seals as standard for dust protection. However, if 
large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, or if large 
❶  Mounting surface, reference mounting surface and 
typical mounting structure
When mounting the Linear Way Module series, properly align the reference 
mounting surfaces B and D of the track rail and slide member with the 
reference mounting surface of the table and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 4)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting surfaces A and C 
are precisely ground. Machining the mounting surface of the table and 
bed, such as machine or device, to high accuracy and mounting them 
properly will ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.
Fig. 4  Reference mounting surface and typical mounting structure
❷ Fixing the slide member
Typical mounting structure of Linear Way Module series is shown in 
Fig. 5. As a convenient means to eliminate play or to give preload 
in linear motion rolling mechanism, preload adjusting screws are 
often used.
Set the preload adjusting screws at the positions of ﬁxing bolts of 
slide member and in the middle of the height of slide member, and 
then press the slide member by tightening the screw.
For mounting the slide member of Linear Way Module LWLM, it is 
recommended to ﬁx the slide member from the table side, because 
the allowance for the preload adjustment in the bolt hole of slide 
member is small. In this case, the bolt hole and the counterbore in 
the table should be made larger to give the adjustment allowance.
Fig.5  Mounting by preload adjusting screws
adjusting screw
Preload amount varies depending on operational conditions of 
your machine and device. However, as excessive preload may 
lead to short life and damage on the raceway, it is typically 
ideal to adjust to zero clearance or slight preload state.
❸  Shoulder height and corner radius of the reference 
For the opposite corner of the mating reference mounting, it is 
recommended to have relieved fillet as indicated in Fig. 6. 
Recommended value for the shoulder height and corner radius on 
the mating side is indicated in Table 7.1, Table 7.2 and Table 7.3.
Fig. 6  Corner of the mating reference mounting
❹ Tightening torque for fixing screw
Typical tightening torque for mounting of Linear Way Module series to the 
steel mating member material is indicated in Table 6. When vibration and 
shock of the machine or device are large, fluctuating load is large, or 
moment load is applied, ﬁx it by using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger 
than the value indicated in the table as necessary. If the mating member 
material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, reduce the tightening torque 
depending on the strength characteristics of the mating member material.

Load Rating and Life  

Life of linear motion rolling guides
Even in normal operational status, a linear motion rolling 
guide will reach the end of its life after a certain period of 
operations. As repeated load is constantly applied onto a 
raceway and rolling elements of the linear motion rolling 
guide, this leads to leprous damage (scale-like wear 
fragments) called fatigue flaking due to rolling contact 
fatigue of materials, it will be unusable at the end. Total 
traveling distance before occurrence of this fatigue ﬂaking 
on a raceway or rolling elements is called the life of linear 
motion rolling guide.
As the life of linear motion rolling guide may vary depending 
on material fatigue phenomenon, rating life based on 
statistic calculation is used.
Rating life
Rating life of linear motion rolling guide refers to the total 
traveling distance 90% of a group of the same linear motion 
rolling guide can operate without linear motion rolling guide 
material damages due to rolling contact fatigue when they 
are operated individually under the same conditions.
Fig. 1  Direction of load rating
Basic dynamic load rating C 
Complying with ISO 14728-1
Basic dynamic load rating refers to load with certain 
direction and size that is logically endurable for rating life of 
50×103 m when a group of the same linear motion rolling 
guides is operated individually under the same conditions.
Basic static load rating C0 
Complying with ISO 14728-2
Basic static load rating refers to static load generating a 
certain contact stress at the center of contact part of the 
rolling elements and a raceway under maximum load, which 
is the load at the allowable limit for normal rolling motion. 
Generally, it is used considering static safety factor.
Static moment rating T0, TX, TY
Static moment rating refers to static moment load 
generating a certain contact stress at the center of contact 
parts of rolling elements and a raceway under the maximum 
load when the moment load shown in Fig. 2 is loaded, which 
is the moment load at the allowable limit for normal rolling 
motion. Generally, it is used considering static safety factor.

Load factor
Load applied to a linear motion rolling guide can be larger 
than theoretical load due to machine vibration or shock. 
Generally, the applied load is obtained by multiplying it by 
the load factor indicated in Table 1.

Static safety factor
Generally, basic static load rating and static moment rating 
is considered as load at the allowable limit for normal rolling 
motion. However, static safety factor must be considered 
according to operating conditions and required performance 
of the linear motion rolling guide.
Static safety factor can be obtained by the following 
equation and typical values are indicated in Tables 2.1 and 
2.2.

Mean Equivalent Load for Fluctuating Load   

Calculated Load
When the load on the Linear Way and Linear Roller Way 
varies, instead of dynamic equivalent load P, the mean 
equivalent load Pm is used for calculating formula of life.
The mean equivalent load is a load converted to give life 
equal to that for fluctuating load. It is obtained by the 
following formula:
Pm＝    
(12)
　where, 
Pm	: Mean equivalent load, N

L : Total traveling distance, m

Pn	: Fluctuating load, N

p : Exponent (ball type: 3, roller type: 10/3)
Table 7 gives calculation examples of the mean equivalent 
load for typical ﬂuctuating loads.

The life and static safety factor in the case of Example 1 is 
calculated. Load factor fW is assumed to be 1.5.
❶Calculation of load on the slide unit
Due to the applied load and the table weight, moment load 
occurs around each coordinate axis of the Linear Way as 
shown below.
Mr ＝Σ（FYZ）＋Σ（FZY）＝FY1Z1＋FZ1Y1＋m1gY2＋m2gY3

＝2000×83＋1000×50＋10×9.8×0＋10×9.8×80 

≒224000
Mp ＝ Σ｛FX（Z－Zd）｝＋Σ（FZX）＝FX1（Z1－Zd）＋FZ1X1＋m1gX2 
＋m2gX3

＝ 1000×（83－10）＋1000×60＋10×9.8×0＋10×9.8 
×75≒140000
My ＝－Σ｛FX（Y－Yd）｝＋Σ（FYX）＝－FX1（Y1－Yd）＋FY1X1

＝－1000×（50－150）＋2000×60＝220000
where,  Mr :  Moment load in the rolling direction, N・mm

Mp :  Moment load in the pitching direction, N・mm

Accuracy  

Objectives of preload
In some cases, the linear motion rolling guide is used with clearance given to 
the linear motion rolling guide when light motion with small load is required. 
However, for some applications, it may be used with play in the guiding 
mechanism removed or with preload to increase rigidity.
Preload is applied to the contact parts of a raceway and rolling elements with 
internal stress generated in advance. When a external load is applied on the 
preloaded linear motion rolling guide, shock absorbing with this internal stress 
makes elastic deformation smaller, and its rigidity is increased. (See Fig. 3)
Preload setting
Preload amount is determined by considering the characteristics of the machines 
or equipments on which the linear motion rolling guide is mounted and the nature 
of load acting on the linear motion rolling guide. The standard amount of preload 
for linear motion rolling guides is, in general, approx. 1/3 of load when the rolling 
elements are balls (steel balls) and approx. 1/2 of load when they are rollers 
(cylindrical rollers). If the linear motion rolling guides are required to have very high 
rigidity to withstand vibration or ﬂuctuating load, a larger preload may be applied.
For applicable preload amount, see Table 9. For details, see an explanation of 
each series.
Precaution for preload selection
Even when high rigidity must be required, excessive preload should be 
avoided, because it will produce an excessive stress between rolling elements 
and raceways, and eventually result in short life of linear motion rolling guides. 
It is important to apply a proper amount of preload, considering the 
operational conditions. When using with a large preload, contact IKO.

Friction  

Friction of linear motion rolling guide
The static friction (start-up friction) of linear motion rolling 
guides is much lower than that of conventional plain guides. 
Also, the difference between static friction and dynamic 
friction is small, and frictional resistance varies little when 
velocity changes. These are excellent features of linear 
motion rolling guides, and account for their ability to reduce 
power consumption, suppress operating temperature rise, 
and increase traveling speed.
Since frictional resistance and variation are small, highspeed response characteristics to motion commands and 
high accuracy positioning can be achieved.
Friction coefﬁcient
The frictional resistance of linear motion rolling guides varies 
with their model, applied load, velocity and characteristics 
of lubricant. Generally, lubricant or seals are major factors in 
determining the frictional resistance in light load or highspeed operation, while the amount of load is the major 
factor in heavy load or low speed operation. The frictional 
resistance of linear motion rolling guides depends on various 
factors, but generally the following formula is used.
　　F＝μP  
(13)
　　　where, F : Frictional resistance, N
μ : Dynamic friction coefﬁcient
P : Applied load, N
For sealed guides, seal resistance is added to the above 
value, but this resistance varies greatly depending on the 
interference amount of seal lip and lubrication conditions.
Where the lubrication and mounting condition are correct 
and the load is moderate, the friction coefﬁcients of Linear 
Way and Linear Roller Way in operation are within the range 
shown in Table 10. Generally, friction coefficient is large 
under small load.

Note （1） These friction coefﬁcients do not include seal.
Objectives of lubrication
The objectives of applying lubricant for linear motion rolling guides is to keep raceways, 
rolling elements, etc. in a linear motion rolling guide from metal contact, and thereby 
reduce friction and wear preventing heat generation and seizure. When an adequate oil 
ﬁlm is formed at the rolling contact area between the raceways and rolling elements, 
the contact stress due to load can be reduced. To manage the formation of adequate 
oil ﬁlm is important for ensuring the reliability of linear motion rolling mechanism.
Selection of lubricant
To obtain the full performance of linear motion rolling guides, it is necessary to select an 
appropriate lubricant and lubrication method by considering the model, load and velocity 
of each linear motion rolling guide. However, as compared with plain guides, lubrication of 
linear motion rolling guides is much simpler. Only a small amount of lubrication oil is 
needed and replenishment interval is longer, so maintenance can be greatly reduced. 
Grease and oil are the two most commonly used lubricants for linear motion rolling guides.
Grease lubrication　
For linear motion rolling guides, lithium-soap base grease (Consistency No.2 of JIS) is 
commonly used. For rolling guides operating under heavy load conditions, grease 
containing extreme pressure additives is recommended.
In clean and high-vacuum environments, where low dust generating performance and 
low vaporization characteristics are required, greases containing a synthetic-base oil 
or a soap other than the lithium-soap base are used. For applications in these 
environments, due consideration is necessary to select a grease that is suitable for the 
operating conditions of linear motion rolling guide and achieves satisfactory lubrication 
performance at the same time.

Grease replenishment interval
The quality of any grease will gradually deteriorate as operating 
time passes. Therefore, periodic replenishment is necessary. 
Grease replenishment interval varies depending on the operating 
conditions. A six month interval is generally recommended, and if 
the machine operation consists of reciprocating motions with many 
cycles and long strokes, replenishment every three month is 
recommended.
In addition, linear motion rolling guides in which the lubrication part 
"C-Lube" is built deliver long-term maintenance free performance. 
This eliminates the need for lubrication mechanism and workload 
which used to be necessary for linear motion rolling guides and 
signiﬁcantly reduces maintenance cost.
Grease replenishment method
New grease must be supplied through a grease feed device such 
as a grease nipple until old grease is discharged. After grease is 
replenished, running-in is performed and excess grease will be 
discharged to outside of the linear motion rolling guide. Discharged 
grease must then be removed before starting the operation.
The amount of grease required for standard replenishment is about 
1/3 to 1/2 of the free space inside the linear motion rolling guide. 
When grease is supplied from a grease nipple for the ﬁrst time, 
there will be grease lost in the replenishment path. The amount lost 
should be taken into consideration.
Generally, immediately after grease is replenished, frictional 
resistance tends to increase. If additional running-in is performed 
for 10 to 20 reciprocating cycles after excess grease is discharged, 
frictional resistance becomes small and stable.
For applications where low frictional resistance is required, the 
replenishment amount of grease may be reduced, but it must be 
kept to an appropriate level so as not to give a bad inﬂuence on 
the lubrication performance.
Mixing of different type of grease
Mixing different types of grease may result in changing the 
properties of base oil, soap base, or additives used, and, in some 
cases, severely deteriorate the lubrication performance or cause 
trouble due to chemical changes of additives. Old grease should 
therefore be removed thoroughly before ﬁlling with new grease.
Lubrication part "C-Lube"
C-Lube is a porous resin with molding formed ﬁne resin powder. It 
is a lubrication part impregnated with a large amount of lubrication 
oil in its open pores by capillary inside.
Lubrication oil is supplied directly to balls (steel balls) or rollers 
(cylindrical rollers), not to the track rail. When the balls or rollers 
have contact with C-Lube built in the slide unit, lubrication oil is 
supplied to the surface of the balls or rollers. As the balls or rollers 
circulate, the lubricant is distributed to the loading area along the 
track rail. This results in adequate lubrication oil being properly 
maintained in the loading area and lubrication performance will last 
for a long time.
The surface of C-Lube is always covered with the lubrication oil. 
Lubrication oil is continuously supplied to the surface of balls or 
rollers by surface tension in the contact of C-Lube surface and 
balls or rollers.
Oil lubrication
For oil lubrication, heavy load requires high oil viscosity and high 
velocity requires low oil viscosity. Generally, for linear motion rolling 
guides operating under heavy load, lubrication oil with a viscosity 
of about 68 mm2/s is used. For linear motion rolling guides under 
light load at high-speed operation, lubrication oil with a viscosity of 
about 13 mm2/s is used.

Purpose of dust protection
To obtain the full performance of linear motion rolling guides, 
it is important to protect them from the intrusion of dust and 
other harmful foreign substances. Select an effective sealing 
or dust-protection device to withstand any operating 
conditions that might be imposed.
Method of dust protection
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way have end seals as a 
standard speciﬁcation. In addition, double seals or scrapers 
are provided as special speciﬁcations for improvement in dust 
protection performance. Also caps and a rail cover sheet to 
cover the mounting hole of track rail (Fig. 5) and track rail 
mounting from bottom with no mounting hole on the upper 
surface (Fig. 6) will further increase the reliability of dust 
protection.
However, if large amount of contaminant or dust are ﬂoating, 
or if large particles of foreign substances such as chips or 
sand may adhere to the raceway, complete dust protection 
becomes difﬁcult. In this case, it is recommended to cover the 
whole unit with bellows (Fig. 7), telescope type shield, etc.
When rail cover sheet or track rails mounting from bottom 
speciﬁcation is needed, please contact IKO.

Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature for linear motion rolling 
guide with integrated C-Lube is 80°C. The maximum 
operating temperature for linear motion rolling guide without 
integrated C-Lube is 120°C and temperature up to 100°C is 
allowed for continuous operation. When the temperature 
exceeds 100°C, please contact IKO.
When specifying special specification with C-Lube plate 
(supplemental code "/Q"), utilize it below 80°C.
Multiple slide units used in close 
proximity
When using multiple slide units in close proximity, greater 
load may be applied than the calculated value depending on 
the deviation of slide unit mounting accuracy for the 
machine or device. In such cases, allowance for greater 
applied load than the calculated value should be made.
Lateral or upside-down mounting
For lateral or upside-down mounting of the Linear Way E 
and Linear Way F, specify the special specification 
(supplemental code "/U") with under seal as necessary to 
prevent foreign substances from entering into the slide unit.
Operation velocity
Operation velocity limit value of the Linear Way and Linear 
Roller Way depends on operation conditions such as motion 
characteristics, applied load, lubrication status, mounting 
accuracy and environment temperature.
Reference values based on actual performance and 
experienced values as a reference of maximum velocity 
under typical operating conditions are indicated in Table 19.

Cleaning and removing fat
Never clean up a linear motion rolling guide with integrated 
C-Lube with organic solvent or white kerosene with property 
of removing fat.
Lubrication oil supply point for oil 
lubrication
If the lubrication oil is supplied by a gravity drip system, 
enough lubrication oil may not be supplied to ways above 
the supply point, so lubrication path and supply point must 
be considered. For such applications, please contact IKO.
When mounting multiple assembled 
sets at the same time
● Interchangeable speciﬁcation products
For interchangeable speciﬁcation products, assemble a slide unit 
and a track rail with the same interchangeable code ("S1" or "S2").
● Non-interchangeable speciﬁcation products
Do not change the combination of delivered slide unit and track rail.
● Product including multiple assembled sets
For special specification (supplemental code "/W") products with 
multiple assembled sets, the delivered combination is managed as a 
group for variation. So do not mix with different group for mounting.
Assembling of slide unit and track rail
When assembling the slide unit on the track rail, correctly ﬁt the grooves of the slide 
unit and the track rail and move the slide unit softly in parallel direction. Rough handling 
may result in damaging of seals or dropping of steel balls and cylindrical roller.
For product including a dummy rail as a standard accessory, operation of the slide unit 
to the track rail can be made easier by using the dummy rail.
Though the dummy rail is included as an accessory of products indicated in Table 21.1 
and Table 21.2, it is also available for other products. If these parts are necessary, 
please contact IKO.
Mounting accuracy
Deviation of accuracy of Linear Way and Linear Roller Way mounting surface or deviation of 
accuracy in mounting may generate large load over the calculated value. Note that such 
load could affect the life adversely. It enhances the reliability of Linear Way and Linear Roller 
Way to ensure high machining accuracy and assembly accuracy depending on operational 
conditions of the track rail and slide unit such as required motion accuracy and rigidity and 
to consider mounting structure that can maintain the accuracy and performance.
Typical reference values for mounting parallelism between multiple assembled sets used 
are shown in Table 20.

Tightening torque for ﬁxing screw
Typical fixing screw tightening torque to mount the Linear 
Way and Linear Roller Way is indicated in Table 22. When 
vibration and shock of the machine or device are large, 
ﬂuctuating load is large, or moment load is applied, ﬁx it by 
using the torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the value 
indicated as necessary.
If the mating member material is cast iron or aluminum alloy, 
reduce the tightening torque depending on the strength 
characteristics of the mating member material.
For details, see an explanation of each series.

Precaution for Mounting
Mounting surface, reference mounting 
surface and typical mounting structure
When mounting Linear Way and Linear Roller Way, properly 
align the reference mounting surface B and D of the track 
rail and slide unit with the reference mounting surface of the 
table and bed and ﬁx them. (See Fig. 11)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting 
surfaces A and C are precisely ground. Machining the 
mounting surface of the table and bed, such as machine or 
device, to high accuracy and mounting them properly will 
ensure stable linear motion with high accuracy.

・As indicated in Fig. 37, tighten the preload adjusting screw 
at the center ﬁrst and then all the rest preload adjusting 
screws in order while measuring the clearance by using 
the dial gauge.
・The position where the dial gauge deflection stops after 
moving the table to right and left indicates zero preload or 
slight preload state.
・After preload adjustment, tighten the fixing bolt to fix 
them.

Mounting Examples
Mounting of reference side track rail
Mounting methods of reference side track rail are indicated 
below. Select a method suitable for the specifications of 
your machine or device.
❶ Method to use reference mounting surface
・Stick track rail reference mounting surface to the reference 
mounting surface of the bed by using a pressure plate or 
small type vise, and tighten the fixing bolt at the same 
position. Repeat this method from one end to ﬁx the track 
rail in order.
❷ Method to use temporary reference surface
・Prepare temporary reference surface around the mounting 
surface of the bed, temporarily fix the track rail, fix the 
measurement stand on the upper surface of the slide unit 
as indicated in Fig. 39, place an indicator onto the 
temporary reference surface, and ﬁx them from one end of 
the track rail in order while maintaining straightness.
Fig. 39  Method to use temporary reference surface
❸ Method with straight-edge
・After temporary ﬁxing of the track rail, apply an indicator 
to the reference mounting surface of the track rail as 
indicated in Fig. 40 and ﬁx them from one end of the track 
rail in order referring to the straight-edge while maintaining 
straightness.

Mounting of driven side track rail
Mounting methods of driven side track rail are indicated 
below. Select a method suitable for the specifications of 
your machine or device.
❶ Method to use reference mounting surface
・Stick track rail reference mounting surface to the reference 
mounting surface of the bed by using a pressure plate or 
small type vise, and tighten the fixing bolt at the same 
position. Repeat this method from one end to ﬁx the track 
rail in order.
❷ Method to follow the reference side track rail
・Correctly mount the reference side track rail and one of 
the driven slide units in motion direction, temporarily fix 
the rest of slide units and track rails, and fix them from 
one end of the driven side track rail in order ensuring 
smooth motion status.
❸ Method with straight-edge
・After temporary ﬁxing of the track rail, apply an indicator 
to the reference mounting surface of the track rail as 
indicated in Fig. 40 and ﬁx them from one end of the track 
rail in order referring to the straight-edge while maintaining 
straightness.
❹ Method to use reference side Linear Way
・Fix a measurement stand onto the upper surface of the 
reference side slide unit as indicated in Fig. 41, place an 
indicator onto the reference mounting surface of the 
driven side track rail, and ﬁx them from one end in order 
while maintaining parallelism.

Mounting procedures when track rails 
are butt-jointed
When multiple track rails are butt-jointed, it is necessary to 
specify special specification butted track rails (noninterchangeable specification, supplemental code "/A") or 
butt-jointing track rails (interchangeable specification, 
supplemental code "/T").
Butt-jointing track rails have a butt-jointing mark on the 
track rail end surface as indicated in Fig. 42. Typical method 
to butt-joint the track rails is as follows.
❶ Align the butt-jointing mark on the track rail end surface 
and temporarily fix it. Since butt-jointing track rails are 
interchangeable, no butt-jointing position is specified.
❷ Correctly align the reference mounting surface of the 
track rail with that of the bed in order. At this point, use a 
small type vise or the like to stick the reference mounting 
surfaces of the bed and track rail together so as to eliminate 
any step at the joint part of the track rail. (See Fig. 43)

Introduction of Technical Service Site
"IKO Technical Service Site" can be accessed from our home page. The site provides various tools for 
selecting Linear Ways and Linear Roller Ways. Please utilize these tools for assistance when selecting 
products. Additionally the site also provides CAD data and product catalogs for the Needle Series, 
Linear Motion Rolling Guide Series, and Mechatronics Series for download. Please utilize them to 
improve your design efﬁciency.
1. Technical calculations
For Linear Way/Linear Roller Way load and life calculation, you 
can obtain the calculated load and the rating life by entering the 
operating conditions.
Also you can derive the motor torque required for operation and 
the effective propulsion force during operation in the sections of 
motor torque calculation and calculation of effective propulsion 
force of linear motor tables respectively, and output the calculation results in PDF format, as well as save the histories.
2. Selection of Identiﬁcation Number
By selecting such speciﬁcation as model code, dimensions, part code, material 
code, preload symbol, classiﬁcation symbol, interchangeable code and 
supplemental code of Linear ways/Linear roller ways, you can easily specify 
the identiﬁcation number used for ordering.
Also you can browse the CAD data of the selected products, calculate the load, 
and output the selection results in PDF format, as well as save the histories.
4. Downloading Catalog and Operation Manual
3. Downloading CAD data
There are two types of ﬁgures, brief ﬁgure and detailed ﬁgure. The 
brief ﬁgure shows only the external view lines, and the detailed 
ﬁgure shows the detailed lines. The drawing consists of three 
drawings: front view, side view and plain view. The scale shows 
only the original size (1:1), and it does not show dimension lines.
2-dimensional CAD data (DXF ﬁle)
It is linked to the mechanical parts CAD library 
"PART community". Entering the rail dimension 
and option contents to the detail, you can view 
the 2D/3D CAD data suitable for the speciﬁcation 
for free of charge.
3-dimensional CAD data
You can download product catalogs of needle series, linear motion rolling guide series and mechatronics 
series, operation manuals of precision positioning tables and various electrical components in PDF format, 
as well as support software for precision positioning tables. If you would like a copy of our catalog, please 
visit the IKO ofﬁcial website and apply for the catalog, or contact our regional ofﬁce or sales ofﬁce nearby.

IKO Linear Motion Rolling Guides are manufactured through a control system 
that alleviates their impact on the global environment to meet the quality 
requirements of ISO 14001 in compliance with the quality requirements level 
of ISO 9001 for quality improvement.
The standard products listed in this catalog comply with the specifications of 
the six hazardous materials mentioned cited in the European RoHS Directive.
Gentle to The Earth
Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. is working to develop global environment-friendly products. 
It is committed to developing products that make its customers’ machinery and 
equipment more reliable, thereby contributing to preserving the global environment. 
This development stance manifests well in the keyword “Oil Minimum.” 
Our pursuit of Oil Minimum has led to the creation of
IKO’s proprietary family of lubricating parts as “C-Lube.”
Products Underpin Sustain
Technology Leaps
Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. was the ﬁrst Japanese manufacturer to develop 
needle bearings on its own and has since expanded into the arena of linear 
motion rolling guides (Linear Motion Series and Mechatro Series) on the 
support of its advanced expertise. The company now offers a vast assortment 
of ingenious products, including the world’s ﬁrst C-Lube Maintenance-Free 
Series, to address increasingly diversiﬁed customer needs and thus sustain 
technology leaps.
C-Lube Maintenance-Free Series Products 
Evolving from the “Oil Minimum” Concept
We have developed lubricating parts impregnated with a large amount of 
lubricant as C-Lube Series to save the customer’s oiling management workload 
and built them into bearings and linear motion rolling guides.
The C-Lube Series not only keeps products maintenance-free for long by giving 
them an optimal and minimal amount of a lubricant for an extended period of 
time but also contributes greatly to preserving the global environment.
