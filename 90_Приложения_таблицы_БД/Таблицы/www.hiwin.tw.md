(1) High positional accuracy
When a load is driven by a linear motion guideway, the frictional contact between the load and the bed desk is rolling 
contact. The coefficient of friction is only 1/50 of traditional contact, and the difference between the dynamic and the 
static coefficient of friction is small. Therefore, there would be no slippage while the load is moving.
(2) Long life with high motion accuracy
With a traditional slide, errors in accuracy are caused by the counter flow of the oil film. Insufficient lubrication causes 
wear between the contact surfaces, which become increasingly inaccurate. In contrast, rolling contact has little wear; 
therefore, machines can achieve a long life with highly accurate motion.
(3) High speed motion is possible with a low driving force
Because linear guideways have little friction resistance, only a small driving force is needed to move a load. This 
results in greater power savings, especially in the moving parts of a system. This is especially true for the reciprocating 
parts.
(4) Equal loading capacity in all directions
With this special design, these linear guideways can take loads in either the vertical or horizontal directions. 
Conventional linear slides can only take small loads in the direction parallel to the contact surface. They are also more 
likely to become inaccurate when they are subjected to these loads.
(5) Easy installation
Installing a linear guideway is fairly easy. Grinding or milling the machine surface, following the recommended 
installation procedure, and tightening the bolts to their specified torque can achieve highly accurate linear motion. 
(6) Easy lubrication
With a traditional sliding system, insufficient lubrication causes wear on the contact surfaces. Also, it can be quite 
difficult to supply sufficient lubrication to the contact surfaces because finding an appropriate lubrication point is 
not very easy. With a linear motion guideway, grease can be easily supplied through the grease nipple on the linear 
guideway block. It is also possible to utilize a centralized oil lubrication system by piping the lubrication oil to the 
piping joint.
(7) Interchangeability
Compared with traditional boxways or v-groove slides, linear guideways can be easily replaced should any damage 
occur. For high precision grades consider ordering a matched, non-interchangeable, assembly of a block and rail.
Preface
A linear guideway allows a type of linear motion that utilizes rolling elements such as balls or rollers. By using recirculating rolling elements between the rail and the block, a linear guideway can achieve high precision linear 
motion. Compared to a traditional slide, the coefficient of friction for a linear guideway is only 1/50. Because of the 
restraint effect between the rails and the blocks, linear guideways can take up loads in both the up/down and the 
left/right directions. With these features, linear guideways can greatly enhance moving accuracy, especially, when 
accompanied with precise ball screws.

(1) Static load rating (C0)
Localized permanent deformation will be caused between the raceway surface and the rolling elements when a linear 
guideway is subjected to an excessively large load or an impact load while either at rest or in motion. If the amount 
of this permanent deformation exceeds a certain limit, it becomes an obstacle to the smooth operation of the linear 
guideway. Generally, the definition of the basic static load rating is a static load of constant magnitude and direction 
resulting in a total permanent deformation of 0.0001 times the diameter of the rolling element and the raceway at the 
contact point subjected to the largest stress. The value is described in the dimension tables for each linear guideway. 
A designer can select a suitable linear guideway by referring to these tables. The maximum static load applied to a 
linear guideway must not exceed the basic static load rating.
(2) Static permissible moment (M0)
The static permissible moment refers to a moment in a given direction and magnitude when the largest stress of 
the rolling elements in an applied system equals the stress induced by the Static Load Rating. The static permissible 
moment in linear motion systems is defined for three directions: MR, MP and MY.
(1) Dynamic load rating (C)
The basic dynamic load rating is an important factor used for calculation of service life of linear guideway. It is defined 
as the maximum load when the load that does not change in direction or magnitude and results in a nominal life of 
50km of operation for a ball type linear guideway and 100km for a roller type linear guideway. The values for the basic 
dynamic load rating of each guideway are shown in dimension tables. They can be used to predict the service life for a 
selected linear guideway.
(3) Static safety factor
This condition applys when the guideway system is static or under low speed motion. The static safety factor, which 
depends on environmental and operating conditions, must be taken into consideration. A larger safety factor is 
especially important for guideways subject to impact loads (See Table 1-1). The static load can be obtained by using 
Eq. 1.1

1-4  Service Life of Linear Guideways
1-4-1 Service Life
When the raceway and the rolling elements of a linear guideway are continuously subjected to repeated stresses, 
the raceway surface shows fatigue. Flaking will eventually occur. This is called fatigue flaking. The life of a linear 
guideway is defined as the total distance traveled until fatigue flaking appears on the surface of the raceway or rolling 
elements.
1-4-2 Nominal Life (L)
The service life varies greatly even when the linear motion guideways are manufactured in the same way or operated 
under the same motion conditions. For this reason, nominal life is used as the criteria for predicting the service 
life of a linear motion guideway. The nominal life is the total distance that 90% of a group of identical linear motion 
guideways, operated under identical conditions, can travel without flaking. When the basic dynamic rated load is 
applied to a linear motion guideway, the nominal life is 50km.
1-4-3 Calculation of Nominal Life
The acting load will affect the nominal life of a linear guideway. Based on the selected basic dynamic rated load and 
the actual load. The nominal life of ball type and roller type linear guideway can be calculated by Eq.1.2 and Eq. 1.3 
respectively.
If the environmental factors are taken into consideration, the nominal life is influenced greatly by the motion 
conditions, the hardness of the raceway, and the temperature of the linear guideway. The relationship between these 
factors is expressed in Eq.1.4 and Eq. 1.5.

1-4-4 Factors of Normal Life
(1) Hardness factor (  fh )
In general, the raceway surface in contact with the rolling elements must have the hardness of HRC 58~62 to an 
appropriate depth. When the specified hardness is not obtained, the permissible load is reduced and the nominal life 
is decreased. In this situation, the basic dynamic load rating and the basic static load rating must be multiplied by the 
hardness factor for calculation.

Transform the nominal life into the service life time by using speed and frequency.
1-5   Applied Loads
1-5-1 Calculation of Load
Several factors affect the calculation of loads acting on a linear guideway (such as the position of the object's center of 
gravity, the thrust position, and the inertial forces at the time of start and stop). To obtain the correct load value, each 
load condition should be carefully considered.

No impacts & vibration
 V ≦ 15 m/min
1   ~  1.2
Small impacts
15 m/min ＜V ≦ 60 m/min
1.2 ~ 1.5
Normal  load
60m/min ＜ V ≦ 120 m/min
1.5 ~ 2.0
With impacts & vibration 
 V ＞120 m/min
2.0 ~ 3.5
(2) Temperature factor (  ft )
Due to the temperature will affect the material of linear guide, therefore the permissible load will be reduced and 
the nominal service life will be  decreased when over 100oC. Therefore, the basic dynamic and static load rating must 
be multiplied by the temperature factor. As some accessories are plastic which can’t resist high temperature, the 
working enviornment is recommended to be lower than 100oC.
(3) Load factor (  fw )
The loads acting on a linear guideway include the weight of slide, the inertia load at the times of start and stop, 
and the moment loads caused by overhanging. These load factors are especially difficult to estimate because 
of mechanical vibrations and impacts. Therefore, the load on a linear guideway should be divided by the 
empircal factor.

1-5-2 Calculation of The Mean Load for Variable Loading
When the load on a linear guideway fluctuates greatly, the variable load condition must be considered in the life 
calculation. The definition of the mean load is the load equal to the bearing fatigue load under the variable loading 
conditions. It can be calculated by using table 1-5.

1-5-3 Calculation for Bidirectional Equivalent Loads
HIWIN linear guideways can accept loads in several directions simultaneously. To calculate the service life of the 
guideway when the loads appear in multiple directions, calculate the equivalent load (Pe ) by using the equations 
below.
HG/EG/WE/QH/QE/QW/RG/QR Series
MG Series
1-5-4 Calculation Example for Service Life
A suitable linear guideway should be selected based on the acting load. The service life is calculated from the ratio of 
the working load and the basic dynamic load rating.

Eq.1.10

1-6 Friction
As  mentioned in the preface, a linear guideway allows a type of rolling motion, which is achieved by using balls or 
rollers. The coefficient of friction for a linear guideway can be as little as 1/50 of a traditional slide. Generally, the 
coefficient of friction of ball type linear guideway is about 0.004 and roller type is about 0.003 .

When a load is 10% or less than the basic static load rate, the most of the resistance comes from the grease viscosity 
and frictional resistance between balls.  In contrast, if the load is more than the basic static load rating, the resistance 
will mainly come from the load.

1-8  The Butt-joint Rail
Jointed rail should be installed by following the arrow sign and ordinal number which is marked on the surface of 
each rail.
For matched pair, jointed rails, the jointed positions should be staggered. This will avoid  accuracy problems due to 
discrepancies between the 2 rails (see figure).
Stagger the joint position 
when installing matched jointed rail.

1-7-2 Oil
The recommended viscosity of oil is about 32~150cSt. The standard grease nipple may be replaced by an oil piping joint 
for oil lubrication. Since oil evaporates quicker than grease, the recommended oil feed rate is approximate 0.3cm3/hr. 
1-7  Lubrication
Supplying insufficient lubrication to the guideway will greatly reduce the service life due to an increase in rolling 
friction. The lubricant provides the following functions;
	 Reduces the rolling friction between the contact surfaces to avoid abrasion and 

 surface burning of the guideway.
	 Generates a lubricant film between the rolling surfaces and decreases fatigue.
	 Anti-corrosion .
1-7-1 Grease
Linear guideway must be lubricated with the lithium soap based grease before installation. After the linear guideway 
is installed, we recommend that the guideway be re-lubricated every 100 km. It is possible to carry out the lubrication 
through the grease nipple. Generally, grease is applied for speeds that do not exceed 60 m/min  faster speeds will 
require high-viscosity oil as a lubricant.

1-9  Mounting Configurations
Linear guideways have  equal load ratings in the radial, reverse radial and lateral directions. 
The application depends on the machine requirements and load directions.
Typical layouts for linear guideways are shown below:
 Use of one rail and mounting reference side
use of two rails(block fixed)
HGW type block with mounting holes in 
different directions.
 use of two internal rails
 use of two external rails

Three installation methods are recommended based on the required running accuracy and the degree of impacts and 
vibrations.
1-10-1 Master and Subsidiary Guide
For non-interchangeable type Linear Guideways, there are some differences between the master guide and 
subsidiary guide. The accuracy of the master guide’s datum plane is better than the subsidiary’s and it can be a 
reference side for installation. There is a mark “MA” printed on the rail, as shown in the figure below.

(1) Mounting methods
It is possible that the rails and the blocks will be displaced when the machine is subjected to vibrations and impacts. 
To eliminate these difficulties and achieve high running accuracy, the following four methods are recommended 
for fixing.
 Mounting with taper gib
 Mounting with needle roller
Mounting with push screws
 Mounting with a push plate 
(2) Procedure of rail installation
Before starting, remove all dirt from the mounting   
surface of the machine.
Tighten the mounting bolts with a torque wrench to  
the specified torque. 
Install the remaining linear guideway in the 
same way.
Oil stone
Check for correct thread engagement when  
inserting a bolt into the mounting hole while the rail  
is being placed on the mounting surface of the bed.
Tighten the push screws sequentially to ensure close            
contact between the rail and the side datum plane.
Place the linear guideway gently on the bed. 
Bring the guideway into close contact with 
the datum plane of the bed.

1-10-3  Installation of the Master Guide without Push Screws
To ensure parallelism between the subsidiary guide and the master guide without push screws, the following rail 
installation methods are recommended. The block installation is the same as mentioned previously.
Using a vice
Place the rail into the mounting plane of the bed. 
Tighten the mounting bolts temporarily; then use a

1-10-5 Linear Guideway Mounting Instructions
1. HIWIN guideways are supplied with a coating of anti-corrosion oil before being shipped. Please clean the oil before 
moving or running the blocks. 
2. Recognition of master and subsidiary rails: For 
non-interchangeable type linear guideways, there 
are some differences between the master rail and 
subsidiary rail. The accuracy of the master rail’s 
datum plane is better than the subsidiary’s and it can 
be a reference side for installation. There is a mark 
“MA” printed on the rail. Check for the correct order 
before starting the installation. The rail number of 
master is an odd number and the rail number of 
subsidiary is an even number. Please install the 
rails according to the indication and carry on the 
installation according to the order for multi-rails 
installment (e.g.: 001 pairs 002 ; 003 pairs 004 etc.) 
3. Recognition of datum plane: The datum plane (B) 
of rail is the side indicated by the arrow, which is 
marked on the top surface of the rail. The datum 
plane of block is smooth ground surface which 
shows as D in Figure 2.
1-10-4 When There Is No Side Surface of The Bed On The Master Guide Side
To ensure parallelism between the subsidiary guide and the master guide when there is no side surface, the following 
rail installation method is recommended. The installation of the blocks is the same as mentioned previously.
(2) Installation of the rail on the subsidiary guide side
The method of installation for the rail on the subsidiary guide side is the same as the case without push screws.

plane of the rail from one end to the other. 
Make sure the mounting bolts are tightened 
securely in sequence.
Using a provisional datum plane
Two blocks are fixed in close contact by the 
measuring plate. A datum plane provided 
on the bed is used for straight alignment of 
the rail from one end to the other. Move the 
blocks and tighten the mounting bolts to the 
specified torque in sequence.

4. Butt-joint rail: Butt-joint rail should be installed by following the arrow sign and ordinal number which is marked 
on the surface of each rail as shown in the figure 3. To avoid accuracy problems due to discrepancies between the 2 
rails such as for matched pair, butt-joint rails, the jointed positions should be staggered as shown in figure 4.  
5. Do not remove blocks from rails when assembling the guideways in machines as far as possible. Please use block 
inserts (please see Figure 5) if it is necessary to remove/ mount block from/ onto rail.
6. Please do not randomly mix block units and rails for non 
interchangeable type to avoid any installation problem. 
7. To ensure the straightness of rail, please tighten the mounting 
bolts sequentially with a torque wrench to the specified torque.
(Refer to HIWIN Technical Information).
1-10-6 Linear Guideway Usage Instructions
	 1.	Lubricate the blocks after assembling the guideways in machines. Use a lithium soap-base grease or oil.
	 2.	The guideways are packaged with anti-corrosion oil before delivery. If the rails were cleaned before installation, 
remember to lubricate the rails after assembling the guideways in machine.(Please confirm the compatibility 
between lubricant & anti rust rail)
	 3.	The blocks are composed of various plastic parts, please avoid prolonged exposure of these parts with any 
organic solvent when cleaning the blocks to prevent possible damage.
	 4.	Try to avoid any foreign objects from getting into the block as this could result in damage to the product.
	 5.	Please do not disassemble the parts, the incautious actions of disassembly may bring foreign objects into the 
block and diminish the precision of the guideways or cause possible damage. 
	 6.	When handling the guideways please hold them horizontally. Improper handling can cause the blocks to fall off 
the rail.

2-1 HG Series - Heavy Load Ball Type Linear Guideway
2-1-3  Model Number of HG Series
HG series guideways can be classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes are identical. 
The only difference between the two types is that the interchangeable type of blocks and rails can be freely exchanged, 
and their accuracy can reach up to P class. The model number of HG series contains the size, type, accuracy class, 
preload class, etc..
2-1-1   Features of HG Series 
(1) Self-aligning capability 
By design, the circular-arc groove has contact points at 45 degrees. HG series can absorb most installation errors due 
to surface irregularities and provide smooth linear motion through the elastic deformation of rolling elements and 
the shift of contact points. Self-aligning capability, high accuracy and smooth operation can be obtained with an easy 
installation.
(2) Interchangeability 
Because of precision dimensional control, the dimensional tolerance of HG series can be kept in a reasonable range, 
which means that any blocks and any rails in a specific series can be used together while maintaining dimensional 
tolerance. And a retainer is added to prevent the balls from falling out when the blocks are removed from the rail. 
(3) High rigidity in all four directions 
Because of the four-row design, the HG series linear guideway has equal load ratings in the radial, reverse radial 
and lateral directions. Furthermore, the circular-arc groove provides a wide-contact width between the balls and the 
groove raceway allowing large permissible loads and high rigidity.
(Double seals and scraper)
Grease nipple
End cap
Bolt cap
HG series linear guideways are designed with load capacity and rigidity higher than other similar products with 
circular-arc groove and structure optimization. It features equal load ratings in the radial, reverse radial and lateral 
directions, and self-aligning to absorb installation-error. Thus, HIWIN HG series linear guideways can achieve a long 
life with high speed, high accuracy and smooth linear motion.

(2) Preload classes
HIWIN offers three classes of standard preload for various applications and conditions.
2-1-6  Preload
(1) Definition 
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Oversized 
balls are used. Generally, a linear motion guideway 
has a negative clearance between groove and balls in 
order to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. 
The figure shows the load is multiplied by the preload, 
the rigidity is doubled and the deflection is reduced 
by one half. The preload no larger than ZA would be 
recommended for the model size under HG20 to avoid 
an over-preload affecting the guideway’s life.

Table 2-1-18  Dimensions of Bolt Caps for Rail Mounting Holes
 Bolt caps for rail mounting holes
Caps are used to cover the mounting holes to prevent chips 
or other foreign objects from collecting in the holes. The 
caps will be enclosed in each rail package.

2-1-10 The Accuracy Tolerance of Mounting Surface
(1) The accuracy tolerance of rail-mounting surface
Because of the Circular-arc contact design, the HG linear 
guideway can compensate for some surface-error on 
installation and still maintain smooth linear motion.
As long as the accuracy requirements for the mounting 
surface are followed, high accuracy and rigidity of linear 
motion of the guideway can be obtained without any difficulty. 
In order to satisfy the needs of fast installation and smooth 
movement, HIWIN offers the normal clearance type of preload 
to customers of its high absorption ability of the deviation in 
mounting surface accuracy.

2-1-11  Cautions for Installation
(1) Shoulder heights and fillets
Improper shoulder heights and fillets of mounting 
surfaces will cause a deviation in accuracy and the 
interference with the chamfered part of the rail or 
block. As long as the recommended shoulder heights 
and fillets are followed, installation inaccuracies 
should be eliminated.

HIWIN offers standard rail lengths for customer needs. For non-standard E-values, the recommended dimension 
should no greater than 1/2 of the pitch (P) dimension. This will prevent an unstable rail end.
Note : 	 1. Tolerance of E value for standard rail is 0.5~-0.5 mm. Tolerance of E value for jointed rail is 0~-0.3 mm.

2. Maximum standard length means the max. rail length with standard E value on both sides.
3. If different E value is needed, please contact HIWIN.

Low Profile Ball Type
2-2-1 Features of the EG Series Linear Guideway
The design of the EG series offers a low profile, high load capacity, and high rigidity. It also features an equal load 
rating in all four directions and self-aligning capability to absorb installation-error, allowing for higher accuracies. 
Additionally, the lower assembly height and the shorter length make the EG series more suitable for high-speed, 
automation machines and applications where space is limited.
The retainer is designed to hold the balls in the block even when it is removed from the rail.
2-2-3 Model Number of EG Series
EG series linear guideways are classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes of these two 
types are the same as one another. The main difference is that the interchangeable type of blocks and rails can be 
freely exchanged and they can maintain P-class accuracy. Because of strict dimensional control, the interchangeable 
type linear guideways are a wise choice for customers when rails do not need to be matched for an axis. The model 
number of the EG series identifies the size, type, accuracy class, preload class, etc.

2-2-6 Preload
(1) Definition
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Generally, a linear motion guideway has a negative clearance between 
the groove and balls in order to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. The figure shows that adding a preload 
can improve stiffness of the linear guideway. A preload no greater than ZA would be recommended for model sizes 
smaller than EG20. This will avoid an over-loaded condition that would affect guideway life.

The standard location of the grease fitting is at both ends of the block, the nipple may be mounted in the side or top 
of the block. For lateral installation, we recommend that the nipple be mounted to the non-reference side, otherwise 
please contact us. When lubricating from above, in the recess for the O-ring, a smaller, preformed recess can be 
found. Preheat the 0.8 mm diameter metal tip. Carefully open the small recess with the metal tip and pierce through 
it. Insert a round sealing ring into the recess. (The round sealing ring is not supplied with the block) Do not open the 
small recess with a drill bit this may introduce the danger of contamination. It is possible to carry out the lubrication 
by using the oil-piping joint.

Table 2-2-18   Max. Tolerance of Reference Surface Height (S1)
2-2-10 Mounting Surface Accuracy Tolerance 
Because of the circular-arc contact design, the EG linear guideway can withstand surface-error installation and 
deliver smooth linear motion. When the mounting surface meets the accuracy requirements of the installation, the 
high accuracy and rigidity of the guideway will be obtained without any difficulty. For faster installation and smoother 
movement, HIWIN offers a preload with normal clearance because of its ability to absorb higher deviations in 
mounting surface inaccuracies.

Improper shoulder heights and chamfers of mounting surfaces will cause deviations in accuracy and rail or block 
interference with the chamfered part.
When recommended shoulder heights and chamfers are used, problems with installation accuracy should be 
eliminated.

2-3	 WE Type – Four-Row Wide Rail Linear Guideway
2-3-1 Construction
The WE series features equal load ratings in the radial, reverse radial and the lateral direction with contact points at 
45 degrees. This along with the wide rail, allows the guide way to be rated for high loads, moments and rigidity. By 
design, it has a self-aligning capacity that can absorb most installation errors and can meet high accuracy standards. 
The ability to use a single rail and to have the low profile with a low center of gravity is ideal where space is limited 
and/or high moments are required.
2-3-3 Model Number of WE Series
WE series linear guideways are classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes of these two 
types are the same as one another. The main difference is that the interchangeable type of blocks and rails can be 
freely exchanged and they can maintain P-class accuracy. Because of strict dimensional control, the interchangeable 
type linear guideways are a wise choice for customers when rails do not need to be matched for an axis. The model 
number of the WE series identifies the size, type, accuracy class, preload class, etc.

2-3-6 Preload
(1) Definition
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Generally, 
a linear motion guideway has a negative clearance 
between the groove and balls in order to improve 
stiffness and maintain high precision. The figure 
shows that adding a preload can improve stiffness of 
the linear guideway. 
(2) Preload classes
HIWIN offers three standard preloads for various applications and conditions.

Condition

0~ 0.02C
Certain load direction,low impact, low precision requirement 
Light

 Grease nipple


The standard location of the grease fitting is at both ends of the block, the nipple may be mounted in the side or top 
of the block. For lateral installation, we recommend that the nipple be mounted to the non-reference side, otherwise 
please contact us. When lubricating from above, in the recess for the O-ring, a smaller, preformed recess can be 
found. Preheat the 0.8 mm diameter metal tip. Carefully open the small recess with the metal tip and pierce through 
it. Insert a round sealing ring into the recess. (The round sealing ring is not supplied with the block) Do not open the 
small recess with a drill bit this may introduce the danger of contamination. It is possible to carry out the lubrication 
by using the oil-piping joint.

Because of the circular-arc contact design, the WE linear guideway can withstand surface-error installation and 
deliver smooth linear motion. When the mounting surface meets the accuracy requirements of the installation, the 
high accuracy and rigidity of the guideway will be obtained without any difficulty. For faster installation and smoother 
movement, HIWIN offers a preload with normal clearance because of its ability to absorb higher deviations in 
mounting surface inaccuracies.

HIWIN offers a number of standard rail lengths. Standard rail lengths feature end mounting hole placements set to 
predetermined values (E). For non-standard rail lengths, be sure to specify the E-value to be no greater than 1/2 the 
pitch (P) dimension. An E-value greater than this will result in unstable rail ends.

MGN/MGW series can be used in various applications, such as semiconductor equipment, PCB /IC equipment, 
medical, robotics, measuring equipment, automation equipment, and other miniature sliding machinery.
2-4-10 Model Number of MG Series
MG Series linear guideway can be classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types, which are the 
same size.The interchangeable type is more convenient due to replaceable rails; however, the precision is less than 
non-interchangeable type. With strict dimension and quality control, the interchangeable type linear guideways are 
a suitable choice for customers when rails don’t need to be paired. The model number contains information for the 
size, type, accuracy, preload, and so on.

2-4-13  Preload
MGN/MGW series provides three different preload levels for various applications.
Note: “C” in column preload means basic dynamic load rating.
Table 2-4-6  Preload Classes
2-4-14 Dust Proof Accessories
End seals and standard accessories fixed on both sides of the block can prevent dust from entering the block, so 
the accuracy and service life of a linear guideway can be maintained. Bottom seals are fixed under the skirt portion 
of the block to prevent dust from entering. Customers can order bottom seals by adding the mark “+U” followed by 
the model number. Sizes 9, 12 and 15 provide bottom seals as an option, but size 5, 7 do not offer the option due to 
the space limit of H1. Note that “H1” would reduced if bottom seals are attached, be aware of possible interference 
between block and mounting surface.

2-5	 QH Series – Heavy Load Type Linear Guideway,  

with SynchMotionTM  Technology
The development of HIWIN-QH linear guideway is based on a four-row circular-arc contact. The HIWIN-QH series 
linear guideway with SynchMotionTM Technology offers smooth movement, superior lubrication, quieter operation 
and longer running life. Therefore the HIWIN-QH linear guideway has broad industrial applicability. In the hightech industry where high speed, low noise, and reduced dust generation is required, the HIWIN-QH series is 
interchangeable with the HIWIN-HG series.
2-5-1	Features
(1) Low Noise Design
With SynchMotionTM technology, rolling elements are interposed between the partitions of SynchMotionTM to provide 
impoved circulation. Due to the elimination of contact between the rolling elements, collision noise and sound levels 
are drastically reduced.

(2) Self-Lubricant Design
The partition is a grouping of hollow ring-like structures formed with a through hole to facilitate circulation of the 
lubricant. Because of the special lubrication path design, the lubricant of the partition storage space can be refilled. 
Therefore, the frequency of lubricant refilling can be decreased.
The QH-series linear guideway is pre-lubricated. Performance testing at a 0.2C (basic dynamic load) shows that after 
running 4,000km no damage was apparent to either the rolling elements or the raceway.

(3) Smooth Movement
In standard linear guideways, rolling elements on the load side of the guide block begin rolling and push their way 
through the raceway. When they contact other rolling elements they create counter-rotational friction. This results in 
a great variation of rolling resistance. The QH linear guideway, with SynchMotionTM technology prevents this condition. 
As the block starts to move, the rolling elements begin rolling consecutively and remain separated to prevent contact 
with one another thus keeping the element's kinetic energy extremely stable in order to effectively reduce fluctuations 
in rolling resistance.

(4) High Speed Performance
The Hiwin-QH series offers excellent high-speed 
performance due to the partitions of the SynchMotionTM 
structure. They are employed to separate the adjacent balls 
thereby resulting in low rolling traction and the metallic 
friction between adjacent balls is eliminated.

2-5-3 Model Number of QH Series
HIWIN-QH series guideway can be classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes are 
identical. The main difference is that the interchangeable blocks and rails can be freely exchanged. Because of 
dimensional control, the interchangeable type linear guideway is a perfect choice for the client when rails do not need 
to be paired for an axis. And since the QH and HG share the identical rails, the customer does not need to redesign 
when choosing the QH series. Therefore the HIWIN-QH linear guideway has increased applicability.

(2) Preload classes
HIWIN offers three classes of standard preload for various applications and conditions.
2-5-6  Preload
(1) Definition 
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Oversized 
balls are used. Generally, a linear motion guideway 
has a negative clearance between groove and balls in 
order to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. 
The figure shows the load is multiplied by the preload, 
the rigidity is doubled and the deflection is reduced 
by one half. The preload no larger than ZA would be 
recommended for the model size under QH20 to avoid 
an over-preload affecting the guideway’s life.

2-5-9 The Accuracy Tolerance of Mounting Surface
(1) The accuracy tolerance of rail-mounting surface
Because of the Circular-arc contact design, the QH linear 
guideway can compensate for some surface-error on 
installation and still maintain smooth linear motion.
As long as the accuracy requirements for the mounting 
surface are followed, high accuracy and rigidity of linear 
motion of the guideway can be obtained without any difficulty. 
In order to satisfy the needs of fast installation and smooth 
movement, HIWIN offers the normal clearance type of preload 
to customers of its high absorption ability of the deviation in 
mounting surface accuracy.

2-6-2 Model Number of QE Series
HIWIN-QE series guideway can be classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes are 
identical. The main difference is that the interchangeable blocks and rails can be freely exchanged. Because of 
dimensional control, the interchangeable type linear guideway is a perfect choice for the client when rails do not need 
to be paired for an axis. And since the QE and EG share the identical rails, the customer does not need to redesign 
when choosing the QE series. Therefore the HIWIN-QE linear guideway has increased applicability.

2-6-5 Preload
(1) Definition
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Generally, 
a linear motion guideway has a negative clearance 
between the groove and balls in order to improve 
stiffness and maintain high precision. The figure shows 
that adding a preload can improve stiffness of the 
linear guideway. A preload no greater than ZA would 
be recommended for model sizes smaller than QE20. 
This will avoid an over-loaded condition that would 
affect guideway life.

Condition
Very Light Preload
0~ 0.02C
Certain load direction,low impact, low precision required 
Light Preload
0.03C~0.05C

Medium Preload
0.06C~ 0.08C
High rigidity required, with vibration and impact

2-6-8 Mounting Surface Accuracy Tolerance 
Because of the circular-arc contact design, the QE linear 
guideway can withstand surface-error installation and deliver 
smooth linear motion. When the mounting surface meets the 
accuracy requirements of the installation, the high accuracy and 
rigidity of the guideway will be obtained without any difficulty. 
For faster installation and smoother movement, HIWIN offers a 
preload with normal clearance because of its ability to absorb 
higher deviations in mounting surface inaccuracies.

2-6-9 Cautions for Installation
(1) Shoulder heights and chamfers
Improper shoulder heights and chamfers of mounting surfaces will cause deviations in accuracy and rail or block 
interference with the chamfered part.
When recommended shoulder heights and chamfers are used, problems with installation accuracy should be 
eliminated.
Table 2-6-15  Shoulder Heights and Chamfers
Table 2-6-16  Tightening Torque
(2) Tightening Torque of Bolts for Installation
Improperly tightened mounting bolts will seriously affect the accuracy of linear guide installations. The following 
tightening torques for different sizes of bolts are recommended.

2-7-5 Preload
(1) Definition
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Generally, 
a linear motion guideway has a negative clearance 
between the groove and balls in order to improve 
stiffness and maintain high precision. The figure 
shows that adding a preload can improve stiffness of 
the linear guideway.

(1) Shoulder heights and chamfers
Improper shoulder heights and chamfers of mounting surfaces will cause deviations in accuracy and rail or block 
interference with the chamfered part.
When recommended shoulder heights and chamfers are used, problems with installation accuracy should be 
eliminated.

2-7-8 Mounting Surface Accuracy Tolerance 
Because of the circular-arc contact design, the QW linear guideway can withstand surface-error installation and 
deliver smooth linear motion. When the mounting surface meets the accuracy requirements of the installation, the 
high accuracy and rigidity of the guideway will be obtained without any difficulty. For faster installation and smoother 
movement, HIWIN offers a preload with normal clearance because of its ability to absorb higher deviations in 
mounting surface inaccuracies.

HIWIN offers a number of standard rail lengths. Standard rail lengths feature end mounting hole placements set to 
predetermined values (E). For non-standard rail lengths, be sure to specify the E-value to be no greater than 1/2 the 
pitch (P) dimension. An E-value greater than this will result in unstable rail ends.

(2) Preload classes
HIWIN offers three classes of standard preload for various applications and conditions.
2-8-6  Preload
(1) Definition 
A preload can be applied to each guideway. Oversized 
balls are used. Generally, a linear motion guideway 
has a negative clearance between groove and balls in 
order to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. 
The figure shows the load is multiplied by the preload, 
the rigidity is doubled and the deflection is reduced 
by one half. The preload no larger than ZA would be 
recommended for the model size under HG20 to avoid 
an over-preload affecting the guideway’s life.

CG rail designed with DB type (also known as o arrangemnt) which has better moment load capacity. Moreover, The CG 
series can compensate for some suface-error on installation and still maintain smooth linear motion due to circulararc contact design.

2-8-11  Cautions for Installation
(1) Shoulder heights and fillets
Improper shoulder heights and fillets of mounting surfaces will cause a deviation in accuracy and the interference 
with the chamfered part of the rail or block. As long as the recommended shoulder heights and fillets are followed, 
installation inaccuracies should be eliminated.

(2) Tightening Torque of Bolts for Installation
Improper tightening of bolts will seriously influence the accuracy of Linear Guideway installation. The following 
tightening torques for different sizes of bolts are recommended.

HIWIN offers standard rail lengths for customer needs. For non-standard E-values, the recommended dimension 
should not be greater than 1/2 of the pitch (P) dimension. This will prevent an unstable rail end.
Note : 	 1. Tolerance of E value for standard rail is 0.5~-0.5 mm. Tolerance of E value for jointed rail is 0~-0.3 mm.

2. Maximum standard length means the max. rail length with standard E value on both sides.
3. If different E value is needed, please contact HIWIN.

The acting load will affect the nominal life of a linear guideway. Based on the selected basic dynamic rated load and 
the actual load. The nominal life of ball type and roller type linear guideway can be calculated by Eq.2.5 respectively.
If the environmental factors are taken into consideration, the nominal life is influenced greatly by the motion 
conditions, the hardness of the raceway, and the temperature of the linear guideway. The relationship between these 
factors is expressed in Eq.2.6.
2-9   RG Series – High Rigidity Roller Type Linear Guideway
2-9-1 Advantages and features
The new RG series from Hiwin features a roller as the rolling element instead of steel balls. The roller series offers 
super high rigidity and very high load capacities. The RG series is designed with a 45-degree angle of contact. Elastic 
deformation of the linear contact surface, during load, is greatly reduced thereby offering greater rigidity and higher 
load capacities in all 4 load directions.The RG series linear guideway offers high performance for high-precision 
manufacturing and achieving longer service life.
(2) Super high rigidity
The RG series is a type of linear guideway that uses rollers as 
the rolling elements. Rollers have a greater contact area than 
balls so that the roller guideway features higher load capacity 
and greater rigidity. The figure shows the rigidity of a roller 
and a ball with equal volume.
Lateral Load(kN)
Deformation of Diameter (µm)
(3) Super high load capacity
With the four rows of rollers arranged at a contact angle of 
45-degrees, the RG series linear guideway has equal load 
ratings in the radial, reverse radial and lateral directions. The 
RG series has a higher load capacity in a smaller size than 
conventional, ball-type linear guideways.
(4) Operating life increased
Compare with the ball element, the contact pressure of 
rolling element is distributed on the line region. Therefore, 
stress concentration was reduced siginificantly and the RG 
series offers longer running life. The nominal life of RG series 
can be calculated by using Eq. 
L =
• 100km =
• 62mile

L = fh

(1) Optimal design
FEM analysis was performed to determine 
the optimal structure of the block and the 
rail. The unique design of the circulation path 
allows the RG series linear guideway to offer 
smoother linear motion.

2-9-3 Model Number of RG series
RG series linear guideways are classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes of these two 
types are the same as one another. The main difference is that the interchangeable type of blocks and rails can be 
freely exchanged and they can maintain P-class accuracy. Because of strict dimensional control, the interchangeable 
type linear guideways are a wise choice for customers when rails do not need to be matched for an axis. The model 
number of the RG series identifies the size, type, accuracy class, preload class, etc.

2-9-4 Types
(1) Block types
HIWIN offers two types of guide blocks, flange and square type. Because of the low assembly height and large 
mounting surface, the flange type is excellent for heavy moment load applications. 
(2) Rail types
In addition to the standard top mounting type, HIWIN also offers the bottom mounting type of rails.

The accuracy of the RG series can be classified into 
four classes: high (H), precision (P), super precision (SP) 
and ultra precision (UP). Customers may choose the 
class by referencing the accuracy requirements of the 
applied equipment.

2-9-6 Preload
A preload can be applied to each guideway using oversized rollers. Generally, a linear motion guideway has negative 
clearance between the raceway and rollers to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. The RG series linear 
guideway offers three standard preloads for various applications and conditions.
The figure shows the relationship between 
the rigidity, friction and nominal life. A preload 
no larger than ZA would be recommended 
for smaller model sizes to avoid over-preload 
affecting the life of the guideway.

The standard location of the grease fitting is at both 
ends of the block, but the nipple can be mounted in 
the side or the top of block. For lateral installation, 
we recommend that the nipple be mounted at the 
non-reference side, otherwise please contact us. It 
is possible to carry out the lubrication by using an 
oil-piping joint. The figure shows the locations of 
the grease fitting.

HIWIN offers a number of standard rail lengths. Standard rail lengths feature end mounting hole placements set to 
predetermined values (E). For non-standard rail lengths, be sure to specify the E-value to be no greater than 1/2 the 
pitch (P) dimension. An E-value greater than this will result in unstable rail ends.

n=(Number of rail mounting holes)
Note : 	 1. Tolerance of E value for standard rail is 0.5~-0.5 mm. Tolerance of E value for jointed rail is 0~-0.3 mm.

2. Maximum standard length means the max. rail length with standard E value on both sides.

2-10   QR series - Roller type Linear Guideway,

with SynchMotionTM  Technology
HIWIN-QR series offers super high rigidity and very high load capacities. The HIWIN-QR series with SynchMotionTM 
Technology offers low friction, smooth movement, quieter operation and longer running life. In the industry where 
high accuracy, low noise and high rigidity is required, the QR series is interchangeable with the RG series.
2-10-1 Advantages and features
(1) Super high load capacity in linear guideway, with the four rows of rollers 
arranged at a contact angle of 45-degrees, the QR series linear guideway has 
equal load ratings in the radial, reverse radial and lateral directions. The QR 
series has a higher load capacity in a smaller size than conventional, ball-type 
linear guideways.
(2) Low Noise Design With SynchMotionTM technology, rolling elements are interposed between the partitions of 
SynchMotionTM to provide improved circulation. Due to the elimination of contact between the rolling elements, 
collision noise and sound levels are drastically reduced.
(3) Smooth Movement In standard linear guideways, rolling elements on the load side of the guide block begin rolling 
and push their way through the raceway. When they contact other rolling elements they create counter-rotational 
friction. This results in a great variation of rolling resistance. The QR linear guideway, with SynchMotionTM 
technology prevents this condition.
(4) The QR series is a type of linear guideway that uses rollers 
as the rolling elements. Elastic deformation of the linear 
contact surface, during load, is greatly reduced thereby 
offering greater rigidity and higher load capacities in all 4 
load directions.

2-10-3 Model Number of QR series
QR series linear guideways are classified into non-interchangeable and interchangeable types. The sizes of these two 
types are the same as one another. The main difference is that the interchangeable type of blocks and rails can be 
freely exchanged and they can maintain p-class accuracy. Because of strict dimensional control, the interchangeable 
type linear guideways are a wise choice for customers when rails do not need to be matched for an axis. The model 
number of the QR series identifies the size, type, accuracy class, preload class, etc.

2-10-6 Preload
A preload can be applied to each guideway using oversized rollers. Generally, a linear motion guideway has negative 
clearance between the raceway and rollers to improve stiffness and maintain high precision. The QR series linear 
guideway offers three standard preloads for various applications and conditions.
The figure shows the relationship between 
the rigidity, friction and nominal life. A preload 
no larger than ZA would be recommended 
for smaller model sizes to avoid over-preload 
affecting the life of the guideway.

E2 Type
Self Lubrication Kit
(2) Clean and environmentally friendly: Optimized oil usage prevents leaking, making it the ideal solution for clean 
working environments.
(3) Long last and low maintenance: Self-lubricating block is maintenance free in most applications.
(4) No installed limitations: The linear guideway can be lubricated by E2 self-lubricating module irrespective of 
mounting directions.
(5) Easy to be assembled and dismantled: The cartridge can be added or removed from the block even when the 
guideway is installed on a machine.
(6) Different oils can be selected: The replaceable oil cartridge can be refilled with any approved lubrication oil 
depending on different requirements.
(7)	Applications for special environments: Sealing grease into the block leads to better lubrication effects, especially 
in dusty, dirty, or wet environments.
2-11  E2 Type - Self lubrication Kit for Linear Guideway
E2 self-lubricating linear guideway contains a lubricator between the end cap and end seal. Outside of the block is 
equipped with a replaceable oil cartridge, the configuration of which is listed below.
Lubrication oil flows from the replaceable oil cartridge to the lubricator and then lubricates grooves of rails. The Oil 
cartridge comprises a oil conductor with 3D structure that enables the lubricator to contact oil despite that blocks are 
placed at a random position , and thus the lubrication oil inside the oil cartridge can be used up via capillary action.

2-14-1 Features of the Reinforced Cap
(1) Absorb the machining error
 The elastic O-ring can eliminate some of the machining error caused during the creation of the mounting holes by 
maintaining the tight fit between the cap and the mounting hole.
(2) Vibration and shock resistance
The elastic O-ring can prevent the cap from loosening by absorbing the vibrations caused by external forces acting on 
the guideways.
(3) High performance dust protection
The Reinforced Cap is designed with an elastic O-ring to contact the mounting hole perfectly by eliminating the 
clearance between the cap and the mounting hole resulting in excellent dust protection. 
(4) Service life prolongation
 The service life of the guideway increases due to the smoothness of the rail surface after installation of the 
Reinforced Cap preventing any damage to the end seals during operation.

S99TE20-1610 1
Ballscrews, also called a ball bearing screws, recirculating ballscrews, etc., consist of a screw spindle and a nut 
integrated with balls and the balls’ return mechanism, return tubes or return caps. Ballscrews are the most common 
type of screws used in industrial machinery and precision machines. The primary function of a ballscrew is to convert 
rotary motion to linear motion or torque to thrust, and vice versa, with the features of high accuracy, reversibility and 
efficiency. HIWIN provides a wide range of ballscrews to satisfy your special requirements.
The combination of state-of-the-art machining technology, manufacturing experiences, and engineering expertise 
makes HIWIN ballscrew users “High-Tech Winners”. HIWIN uses precise procedures to create exact groove profiles, 
either by grinding or precision rolling. Accurate heat treatment is also used to ensure the hardness of our ballscrews. 
These result in maximum load capacity and service life.
HIWIN precision ballscrews provide the most smooth and accurate movement, together with low drive torque, 
high stiffness and quiet motion with predictable lengthened service life. HIWIN rolled ballscrews also provide smooth 
movement and long life for general applications with less precision in lower price. HIWIN has modern facilities, highly 
skilled engineers, quality manufacturing and assembly processes, and uses quality materials to meet your special 
requirements.
It is our pleasure to provide you with the technical information and selection procedure to choose the right 
ballscrews for your applications through this catalogue.
2.1 Characteristics of HIWIN Ballscrews
There are many benefits in using HIWIN ballscrews, such as high efficiency and reversibility, backlash elimination, 
high  stiffness, high lead accuracy, and many other advantages. Compared with the contact thread lead screws as shown 
in (Fig. 2.1), a ballscrew adds balls between the nut and spindle. The sliding friction of the conventional screw is thus 
replaced by the rolling motion of the balls.  The basic characteristics and resultant benefits of HIWIN ballscrews are 
listed in more details as follows:

Fig 2.2 Mechanical efficiency of ballscrews
(1) High efficiency and reversibility
Ballscrews can reach an efficiency as high as 90% because of the rolling contact between the screw and the nut. 
Therefore, the torque requirement is approximately one third of that of conventional screws. It can be seen from Fig. 2.2 
that the mechanical efficiency of ball screws are much higher than conventional lead screws.
HIWIN ballscrews have super surface finish in the ball tracks which reduce the contact friction between the balls 
and the ball tracks. Through even contact and the rolling motion of the balls in the ball tracks, a low friction force is 
achieved and the efficiency of the ballscrew is increased. High efficiency renders low drive torque during ballscrew 
motion. Hence, less drive motor power is needed in operation resulting in lower operation cost.
HIWIN uses a series of test equipment and testing procedures to guarantee the efficiency.
(2) Backlash elimination and high stiffness
Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machine tools require ballscrews with zero axial backlash and minimal 
elastic deformation (high stiffness). Backlash is eliminated by our special designed Gothic arch form balltrack (Fig. 2.3) 
and preload.
In order to achieve high overall stiffness and repeatable positioning in CNC machines, preloading of the ballscrews 
is commonly used. However, excessive preload increases friction torque in operation. This induced friction torque will 
generate heat and reduce the life expectancy. With our special design and fabrication process, we provide optimized 
ballscrews with no backlash and less heat losses for your application.
(3) High lead accuracy
For applications where high accuracy is required, HIWIN modern facilities permit the achievement of ISO, JIS and 
DIN standards or specific customer requirements.
This accuracy is guaranteed by our precise laser measurement equipment and reported to each customer.
(4) Predictable life expectancy
Unlike the useful life of conventional screws which is governed by the wear on the contact surfaces, HIWIN’s 
ballscrews can usually be used until the metal fatigues. By careful attention to design, quality of materials, heat 
treatment and manufacture, HIWIN’s ballscrews have proved to be reliable and trouble free during the period of 
expected service

life. The life achieved by any ballscrew depends upon several factors including design, quality, maintenance, and the 
major factor, dynamic axial load (C).
Profile accuracy, material characteristics and the surface hardness are the basic factors which influence the 
dynamic axial load.
It is recommended that the life at average axial load should be a minimum of 1x106 revs). High quality ballscrews 
are designed to conform with the B rating (i.e. 90% probability of achieving the design life). Fifty percent of the ballscrews 
can exceed 2 to 4 times of the design life.
(5) Low starting torque and smooth running
Due to metal to metal contact, conventional contact thread lead screws require high starting force to overcome 
the starting friction. However, due to rolling ball contact, ballscrews need only a small starting force to overcome their 
starting friction.
HIWIN uses a special design factor in the balltrack (conformance factor) and manufacturing technique to achieve a 
true balltrack. This guarantees the required motor torque to stay in the specified torque range.
HIWIN has special balltrack profile tracing equipment to check each balltrack profile during the manufacturing 
process. A sample trace is shown in Fig. 2.4. 
HIWIN also uses computer measurement equipment to accurately measure the friction torque of ballscrews. A 
typical distance-torque diagram is shown in Fig. 2.5.

    range better than conventional ballscrews, 
    producing no shrill fricative and better sound 
    quality.
(c) Low vibration and smooth operation
    The tangent recirculation substantially reduces 
    impact force of running balls and the resistance 
    of guiding balls, so the vibration of the nut is 
    gentler and the rotation is smoother and more 
    stable.

a. structure
The first, called the external recirculation type ballscrew, 
consists of the screw shaft,the ball nut, the steel balls, the 
return tubes and the fixing plate. The steel balls are introduced 
into the space between the screw shaft and the ball nut. The 
balls are diverted from the ball tracks and carried back by the 
ball guide return tube form a loop. Since the return tubes are 
located outside the nut body, this type is called the external 
recirculation type ball screw Fig. 3.1.

(4) Internal recirculation type
a. structure
The second design, called the internal recirculation type 
ballscrew, consists of the screw spindle, the ball nut, the steel 
balls and the ball return caps. The steel balls make only one 
revolution around the screw spindle. The circuit is closed by 
a ball return cap in the nut allowing the balls to cross over 
adjacent ball tracks. Since the ball return caps are located 
inside the nut body, this is called the internal recirculation type 
ballscrew Fig. 3.2. 
b. features
(a) Adapted to normal leads
(b) Outer diameter of nut is small
(5) Endcap recirculation type
a. structure
The third design is called endcap recirculation type ball 
screw Fig. 3.3.The basic design of this return system is the 
same as the external recirculation type nut Fig. 3.5 except that 
the return tube is made inside the nut body as a through hole. 
The balls in this design traverse the whole circuit of the ball 
tracks within the nut length. Therefore, a short nut with the 
same load capacity as the conventional design can be used.

4.1 Fundamental Concepts for Selection & Installation
(1) A ballscrew must be thoroughly cleaned in white spirit and oil to protect against corrosion. Trichloroethylene is an 
acceptable degreasing agent, ensuring the ball track free from dirt and damage (paraffin is not satisfactory). Great 
care must be taken to ensure that the ball track is not struck by a sharp edged component or tool, and metallic debris 
does not enter the ball nut (Fig. 4.1).
(2) Select a suitable grade ballscrew for the application (ref. Table 4.5). Install with corresponding mounting disciplines. 
That is, precision ground ballscrews for CNC machine tools demand accurate alignment and precision bearing 
arrangement, where the rolled ballscrews for less precision applications, such as packaging machinery, require less 
precise support bearing arrangement.
It is especially important to eliminate misalignment between the bearing housing center and the ballnut center, which 
would result in unbalanced loads (Fig. 4.3). Unbalanced loads include radial loads and moment loads (Fig. 4.3a). These 
can cause malfunction and reduce service life (Fig.4.3b).

(3) To achieve the ballscrews’ maximum life, the use of antifriction bearing oil is recommended. Oil with graphite and 
MoS2  additives must not be used. The oil should be maintained over the balls and the balltracks.
(4) Oil mist baths or drip feeds are acceptable. However, direct application to the ball nut is recommended (Fig. 4.3).
(5) Select a suitable support bearing arrangement for the screw spindle. Angular contact ball bearings (angle=60˚) 
are recommended for CNC machinery, because of higher axial load capacity and ability to provide a clearance-free or 
preloaded assembly (Fig. 4.4).
(6) A dog stopper should be installed at the end to prevent the nut from over-travelling which results in damage to 
ballscrew assembly (Fig 4.5).
(7) In environments contaminated by dust or metallic debris, ballscrews should be protected using telescopic or bellowtype covers. The service life of a ballscrew will be reduced to about one-tenth normal condition if debris or chips enter 
the nut. The bellow type covers may need to have a threaded hole in the flange to fix the cover. Please contact engineers 
when special  modifications are needed  (Fig 4.6).
(8) If you select an internal recirculation type or an endcap recirculation type ballscrew, one end of the ball thread must 
be cut through to the end surface. The adjacent diameter on the end journal must be 0.5 ~ 1.0 mm less than the root 
diameter of the balltracks (Fig 4.7).
(9) After heat treating the ballscrew spindle, both ends of the balltracks adjacent to the journal have about 2 to 3 leads 
left soft, for the purpose of machining. These regions are shown in (Fig. 4.8) with the mark  “ 
 ” on HIWIN drawings.
Please contact engineers if special requirements are needed in these regions.

(10) Excessive preload increases the friction torque and generates heat which reduces the life expectancy. But 
insufficient preload reduces stiffness and increases the possibility of lost motion. It is recommended that the 
maximum preload used for CNC machine tools should not exceed 8% of the basic dynamic load C.
(11) When the nut needs to be disassembled from/assembled to the screw spindle, a tube with an outer dia. 0.2 to 0.4 
mm less than the root diameter (ref. M37) of the balltracks should be used to release/connect the nut to from/to the 
screw spindle via one end of the screw spindle shown in Fig. 4.9.
(12) As shown in Fig 4.10, the support bearing must have a chamfer to allow it to seat properly and maintain proper 
alignment. HIWIN suggests the DIN 509 chamfer as the standard construction for this design (Fig. 4.11).

4.3 Accuracy Grade of HIWIN Ballscrews
Precision ground ballscrews are used in applications requiring high positioning accuracy and repeatability, smooth 
movement and long service life. Ordinary rolled ballscrews are used for application grade less accurate but still 
requiring high efficiency and long service life. Precision grade rolled ballscrews have an accuracy between that of the 
ordinary grade rolled ballscrews and the higher grade precision ground ballscrews. They can be used to replace certain 
precision ground ballscrews with the same grade in many applications. 
HIWIN makes precision grade rolled ballscrew up to C6 grade. Geometric tolerances are different from those of 
precision ground screws (See Chapter 6). Since the outside diameter of the screw spindle is not ground, the set-up 
procedure for assembling precision rolled ballscrews into the machine is different from that of ground ones. Chapter 7 
contains the entire description of rolled ballscrews.
(1) Accuracy grade
There are numerous applications for ballscrews from high precision grade ballscrews, used in precision 
measurement and aerospace equipment, to transport grade ballscrews used in packaging equipment. The quality and 
accuracy classifications are described as follows: lead deviation, surface roughness, geometrical tolerance, backlash, 
drag torque variation, heat generation and noise level. 


S99TE20-1610 15
HIWIN precision ground ballscrews are classified into 7 classes. In general, HIWIN precision grade ballscrews are 
defined by the so called “V300p” value see Fig 4.12 and rolled grade ballscrews are defined differently as shown in Chapter 7.
Fig. 4.12 is the lead measuring chart according to the accuracy grade of the ballscrews. The same chart by the DIN 
system is illustrated in Fig. 4.13. From this diagram, the accuracy grade can be determined by selecting the suitable 
tolerance in Table 4.2. Fig. 4.14 shows HIWIN’s measurement result according to the DIN standard. Table 4.2 shows the 
accuracy grade of precision grade ballscrews in HIWIN’s specification.The relative international standard is shown in 
Table 4.3.
The positioning accuracy of machine tools is selected by ep value with the V300p variation. The recommended accuracy 
grade for machine applications is shown in Table 4.5. This is the reference chart for selecting the suitable ballscrews in 
different application fields.
(2) Axial play (Backlash)
If zero axial play ballscrews (no backlash) are needed, preload should be added and the preload drag torque is 
specified for testing purpose. The standard axial play of HIWIN ballscrews is shown in Table 4.4.For CNC machine tools, 
lost motion can occur in zero-backlash ballscrews through incorrect stiffness. Please consult our engineers when 
determining stiffness and backlash requirements.
(3) Geometrical tolerance
It is crucial to select the ballscrew of the correct grade to meet machinery requirements. Table 4.6 and Fig 4.15 are 
helpful for you to determine the tolerance factors, which are based on certain required accuracy grades.

4.4 Preload Methods
The specially designed Gothic ball track 
can make the ball contact angle around 45˚. 
The axial force Fa which comes from an outside 
drive force or inside preload force, causes two 
kinds of backlash. One is the normal backlash, 
Sa caused by the manufacturing clearance 
between ball track and ball. The other is the 
deflection backlash, Δl caused by the normal 
force Fn which is perpendicular to the contact 
point.
The clearance backlash can be eliminated 
by the use of an preload internal force P. This 
preload can be obtained via a double nut, an 
offset pitch single nut, or by adjusting the ball size for preloaded single nuts.
The deflection backlash is caused by the preload internal force and the external loading force and is related 
to that of the effect of lost motion.
(1) Double nut preloading
Preload is obtained by inserting a spacer 
between the 2 nuts (Fig. 4.17). “Tension 
preload” is created by inserting an oversize 
spacer and effectively pushing the nuts apart. 
“Compression pre-load” is created by inserting 
an undersize spacer and correspondingly 
pulling nuts together. Tension preload is 
primarily used for  precision ballscrews. 
However, compression preload type ballscrews 
are also available upon your request. If 
pretension is necessary to increase stiffness, 
please contact us for the amount of pretension 
to be used in the ballscrew journal ends. (0.02mm to 0.03mm per meter is recommended, but the T value should 
be selected according to the compensation purpose).
(2) Single nut preloading
There are two ways of preloading a single 
nut. One is called “the oversized-ball preloading 
method”. The method is to insert balls slightly 
larger than the ball groove space (oversized 
balls) to allow balls to contact at four points 
(Fig. 4.18).
The other way is called “The offset pitch 
preloading method” as shown in Fig. 4.19. The 
nut is ground to have a δ value offset on the 
center pitch. This method is used to replace 
the traditional double nut preloading method 
and has the benefit of a compact single nut with 
high stiffness via small preload force. However, 
it should not be used in heavy duty preloading. 
The best preload force is below 5% of dynamic load (C).

(3) Preload calculation
(4) Uniformity of preload drag torque
(1) Measuring method
Preload creates drag torque between the nut and screw. It is measured by rotating the screw spindle at 
constant speed while restraining the nut with a special fixture as shown in Fig. 4.20. The load cell reading force Fp 
is used to calculate the preload drag torque of the ballscrew.
 HIWIN has developed a computerized drag torque measuring machine which can accurately monitor the 
drag torque during screw rotation. Therefore, the drag torque can be adjusted to meet customer requirements 
(Fig. 2.5). The measurement standard for preload drag torque is shown in Fig. 4.21 and Table 4.7.
(2) Measuring conditions
1. Without wiper.
2. The rotating speed, 100 rpm.

Example 4.5 - 2
By the example 4.5-1, if the design service life of the ballscrew is 3500 hours, lead = 10mm, single nut with zero 
backlash, find the nominal diameter of the HIWIN ballscrew.
Calculation
P = Fbm
2.8  = 318.5
 = 114 kgf   (Assume zero backlash when Fbm = 318.5 kgf)
Fa = Fbm + p = 318.5 + 114 = 432.5 kgf   (Ref formula M1) 
L = Lh × nav × 60 = 3500 × 487.5 × 60 = 1.02375 ×108  (revolutions)

So, from the dimensions table of HIWIN ballscrews, select FSV type nut with spindle nominal diameters equals 
32mm and C1 circuits which can satisfy this application.

Example 4.5 - 3
If the ballscrew nominal diameter=50mm, lead=8mm, and service life L=7x106  revolutions, find the permissible load on 
the screw spindle.
Calculation
From the dimensions table of HIWIN ballscrew, the FSV type ballscrew with nominal diameter=50 mm, lead=8 mm and 
B3 type return tube has the dynamic load rating C=5674.

The buckling load diagram for different spindle diameter and support method is shown in Fig 4.25.
Critical speed
The critical speed is said to exist when the rotational frequency of a shaft equals the first natural frequency of the 
shaft. This will cause the ball screw to bend under the stress of vibration coupled with the centrifugal forces due to the 
rotation and cause the shaft to vibrate violently. Therefore, the rotational speed of the ball screw should be set to below 
the value indicated by critical speed.

Dm-N value for ballscrew surface speed
Dm-N value has a strong influence over ballscrew noise, working temperature and service life of return system.
For HIWIN ballscrew, 
Dm × N ≤ 70,000
Dm : Pitch circle diameter (mm)
N : Maximum speed (rpm)
Ballscrew structure enhancement designed by HIWIN when Dm-N value ranges from 70,000 to 180,000 . If Dm-N 
value above 180,000 , please consult our company.
Stiffness is an indication of the rigidity of a machine. The stiffness of the ballscrew is determined by nut-spindle 
rigidity via axial load, balltrack contact rigidity and screw spindle rigidity. When assembling the ballscrew in the machine, 
the stiffness of support bearing, mounting condition of nut with machine table etc. should also be considered. Fig 4.28 
shows the relation of total stiffness of the machine feed system. 
From testing, the stiffness of nut-spindle relation and ball and balltrack relation can be combined into the stiffness 
of nut, Kn, and listed in dimension table of different nut type. The stiffness of the ballscrew is shown as :
Kbs  = 1
Ks  + 1
Kn  
Kbs : Total stiffness of ballscrew (kgf/µm)
The stiffness of the screw spindle is shown as :
Ks = 67.4 dr
L1   (Fixed-Fixed)
Ks = 16.8 dr
L1   (Fixed-Free)
The stiffness chart is shown in Fig 4.29
dr : Root diameter of screw spindle (mm)  Dm − Db 
Db : Diameter of ball (mm)
Ks : Screw spindle stiffness (kgf/µm) 
Kn : Nut stiffness (kgf/µm)
The stiffness of the nut is tested using an axial force equal to the highest possible preload of 10% dynamic load 
(C) and is shown in the dimension table of each nut. When the preload is less than this value, the stiffness of the nut is 
calculated by extrapolation method as :
Kn = 0.8 × K 
0.1C
1/3

Kn : Stiffness of nut
K : Stiffness in the  dimension table
P : Preload
C : Dynamic load on dimension table
Single nut with backlash is calculated when the external axial force is equal to 0.28 C, thus :
Kn = 0.8 × K

2.8 × 0.1C

The axial stiffness of the whole feed system includes the stiffness of support bearings and nut mounting table. The 
designer should consider the total stiffness carefully.


Thermal expansion
∆ L = 11.6 × 10-6 × ∆T × Ls
∆ L : Thermal expansion of screw spindle (mm)
∆ L : (°C) Temperature rise at screw spindle
Ls : Total length of screw spindle (mm)
The T value should be chosen to compensate for the temperature rise of the ballscrew. 
HIWIN recommends a T value of -0.02 ~ -0.03 per meter for CNC machine tools.
Basic dynamic axial load rating C (theoretical)
The dynamic load is the load at which 90% of the ballscrews will achieve the service life of 1 x 106 rev (C). The 
reliability factor can be adjusted by Table 4.8. The dynamic load is shown on the dimension table of each nut type. 
Basic static axial load rating Co (theoretical)
The static load is the load which will cause the balltrack to have a plastic deformation exceeding 0.0001x ball 
diameter. To calculate the maximum static load of a ballscrew, the static safety factor Sf of the application condition 
should be considered.
Sf × Fa(max) < Co
Sf : Static factor = 2.5 max
Co : Static load from the dimension table of the nut type
Fa(max) : Maximum static axial load

If the preload increases to 2x250=500 kgf then Kn=58 kgf/µm and K=15.1 kgf/µm. Total stiffness Kt=13.2 kgf/µm and 
total lost motion δ =0.106 mm. The difference is only 6 µm (5% change). comparing with 250 kgf, preloaded nut, but the 
temperature rise caused by 500 kgf preload is heavy. The spindle stiffness is sometimes more important than the nut 
stiffness. The best way to increase the stiffness of the system is not in the heavy preloading of the ballscrew nut. If the 
support method changes to fixed-fixed, then Ks=82 kgf/µm and Kt becomes 23 kgf/µm. The total lost motion d =0.061 mm. 
The difference is 51µm (45%).


Manufacturing range
The maximum length to which a ballscrew can be manufactured depends on spindle diameter and accuracy grade 
(Table 4.10). Since high accuracy ballscrews require a high degree of straightness to the screw spindle, the higher the 
slender ratio (length/diameter), the more difficult to manufacture and the less the spindle stiffness.
HIWIN recommends the maximum lengths shown in Table 4.10. 
If a longer length is required, please contact with HIWIN engineer.

Heat treatment
HIWIN’s homogenous heat treatment technique gives the ballscrew maximum life capability. Table 4.11 shows the 
hardness value of hardness in each component of HIWIN ballscrews. The surface hardness of the ballscrew affects both 
dynamic and static load value. The dynamic and static values shown in the dimension table are the values for a surface 
hardness equal to HRC 60. If the surface hardness is lower than this value, the following formula will give you the 
calibration result.
C’o = Co × fHO	
fHO = Real Hardness (HRC)
 ≤ 1
C’ = C × fH 	

fH = Real Hardness (HRC)
 ≤ 1
Where fH and fHO are the hardness factor.

Co : Static load

4.6 Temperature Increase Effect on Ballscrews
The temperature increase of a ballscrew during the working period will influence the accuracy of the machine feed 
system, especially in a machine designed for high speed and high accuracy.
The following factors have the effect of raising the temperature in a ballscrew.
(1) Preload      (2) Lubrication       (3) Pretension
Fig 4.30 shows the relation of working speed, preload and temperature rise. Fig 4.31 shows the relation of nut 
temperature rise to preload friction torque. From Fig 4.30, Fig 4.31 and example 4.5-5, doubling the preload of the nut 
will increase the temperature about 5 degrees, but the stiffness increase only by about 5% (few µm).
(1) Preload effect
To avoid any lost motion in the machine feed system, increasing the rigidity of the ballscrew nut is important. 
However, to increase the rigidity of the ballscrew nut, it is necessary to preload the nut to a certain level.
Preloading the nut will increase the friction torque of the screw, making it more sensitive to an increase in 
temperature during working period.
HIWIN recommends using a preload of 8% of the dynamic load for medium and heavy preload, 6% ~ 8% for medium 
preload, 4% ~ 6% for light and medium and below 4% for light preload.
The heaviest preload should not exceed 10% of the dynamic load for best service life and a low temperature rise 
effect.
(2) Lubrication effect
The selection of lubricant will directly influence the temperature rise of the ballscrew.
HIWIN ballscrews require appropriate lubrication either by greasing or oiling. Antifriction bearing oil is 
recommended for ballscrew oil lubrication. Lithium soap based grease is recommended for ballscrew greasing. The 
basic oil viscosity requirement depends on the speed, working temperature and load condition of the application. (Fig 
4.32) shows the relation of oil viscosity, working speed and rise in temperature.
When the working speed is higher and the working load is lower, a low viscosity oil is better. When the working 
speed is lower and the working load is heavy, a high viscosity oil is preferred.
Generally speaking, oil with a viscosity of 32 ~ 68 cSt at 40˚C (ISO VG 32-68) is recommended for high speed 
lubrication (DIN 51519) and viscosity above 90 cSt at 40˚C (ISO VG 90) is recommended for low speed lubrication.
In high speed and heavy load applications the use of a forced coolant is necessary to lessen the temperature. The 
forced lubrication of coolant can be done by a hollow ballscrew.
Fig 4.33 shows a typical application for hollow ballscrew in machine tools. The inspection and replenishing of the 
ballscrew lubricant is listed in Table 4.12.

(3) Pretension effect
When the temperature rises in the ballscrew, the effect of thermal stress will elongate the screw spindle. It can 
make the spindle length unstable.
The elongating relationship can be calculated according to M40. This elongation can be compensated via 
the pretension force. For the purpose of pretension, there is a negative T value indicated in the design drawing to 
compensate the pretension value.
Since a large pretension force will cause the burn down of the supporting bearing, HIWIN recommends using 
pretension when the temperature rise is below 5˚C. Also, if the diameter of the screw spindle is greater than 50 mm, 
it is not suitable for pretension. A large spindle diameter requires a high pretension force, causing burn down of the 
supporting bearing.
HIWIN recommends a T compensation value of about 3˚, (about -0.02~0.03 for each 1000 mm screw spindle). 
Since different applications require different T values, please contact HIWIN engineer.
The pretension force is calculated as :
Pf = Ks × ∆L
Ks : Stiffness of screw spindle (kgf/µm)
Pf : Pretension force (kgf)
∆L : Pretension valus (µm)

7.1 Introduction
HIWIN Rolled Ballscrews are made by a rolling process of the screw spindle instead of a grinding process. Rolled 
ballscrews not only have the benefit of low friction and smooth running for the linear feed system compared with 
traditional screws, but also can be supplied with quick stock delivery and lower production price.
HIWIN uses the most advanced technology in the ballscrew rolling process, and maintains the homogeneous 
manufacturing procedure of selecting materials, rolling, heat treating, machining and assembling. 
In general, rolled ballscrews use the same preload method as the precision ground ballscrews, except that there 
are some differences in the lead error definition and the geometric tolerance. The grade of the rolled ballscrews can 
be ordered according to the same nut dimension of the precision ground ballscrew. If the ends of the spindle are 
unmachined, the geometric tolerance does not apply. The production scale of each type of the ballscrews and the 
accuracy classification are described in the following sections (the unit of length used is in mm).
7.2 Precision Rolled Ballscrews
Table 7.1 gives the lead accuracy of the precision rolled ballscrews. The lead accuracy is measured by the 
accumulated lead error of any portion of 300 mm in length. The maximum axial plays of the precision rolled ballscrews 
are shown in Table 7.2. These ballscrews can be preloaded as the precision ground ones. The categories of the precision 
rolled ballscrews are listed in Table 7.3. 
Fig. 7.1 shows the geometric tolerance of the general rolled ballscrews. HIWIN has a variety of precision rolled 
ballscrews for our customers’ urgent requirements.

 • Application:
Semi-conductor industries, Robots, Wood Processing 
machines , Laser cutting machines, Transporting 
equipment.
 • Features:
1. Compact and high positioning:
A compact design using nut and support bearing 
as an integral unit. A 45-degree steel ball contact 
angle makes a better axial load. Zero backlash 
and higher stiffness construction provides high 
positioning.
2. Simple installation:
Simply installed by fixing the nut on the housing 
with bolts.
3. Rapid feed:
No inertial effect is produced by the integral unit 
rotating and the fixed shaft. Lower power can be 
selected to meet the rapid feed requirement.
4. Stiffness:
Has a higher trust and moment stiffness, 
because the integral unit has an angular contact 
construction. There is no backlash while rolling.
5. Quietness:
Special end cap design allows steel balls to  
circulate inside the nut. Noise generated by high 
speed operation is lower than in an ordinary 
ballscrew.

(1)	 External Return Type
To redue the wear caused by external
force when at high speed, the return system 
is designed with a strong structure deflector and 
its DmN value can reach up to 130,000 MAX. 
(2)	 Super S & RD Series
Super S and RD series uses tangent path 
recirculation design which helps to minimize 
the impact when balls pass through the return 
element and also improve the smoothness of 
the ballscrew. It can also reduce the operation 
noise, the DmN value can reach 160,000 max.

• Precautions:
1.Lubrication
Sufficient lubrication is required for ballscrew operation in order to achieve the service life of the ballscrew. The 
grease will gradually deteriorate with use so it is important to periodically lubricate in order to maintain the efficiency 
of the ballscrew.
2.Lead Accuracy and Axial backlash
The standard accuracy for Heavy load ball screw (HL Series) is JIS C7 (0.05). To ensure the service life of the ball 
screw and avoid excessive rise in temperature, nuts are not preloaded. Standard backlash is 0.02~0.05mm MAX.
3.Axial Load
The dynamic load rating of the ballscrew should be about 3 to 5 times the expected axial load on the ballscrew in 
order to achieve a good service life.
※ It is recommended that the grease used for lubrication to contains extreme pressure additives or use HIWIN G01 series grease.
※ To ensure the grease can lubricate the ball screw directly, it is recommended to have a lubrication hole on each circuit.
3.Quietness
RD series uses tangent return design and spacers between the balls which eliminates the contact of balls with the 
return element and also between the balls. It can reduce the noise of the ballscrew 5~7dBA as compared to the 
traditional external return design.

8.4.1  Extra High Dm-N Value Ballcsrew - 
Cool Type I
 • Cool type I: 
• New era for high speed ballscrew - achieving 
extra high Dm-N value (up to 200,000) and high 
positioning accuracy.
• Cool type I and a hollow shaft design. 
• High speed machine tools and machining center.
 • Design Principle:
The cool type series features forced cooling fluid 
passing through the nut, to minimize heat generation 
and thermal expansion during ballscrew operation.
• Cool type I as shown in the Figure 8.1:
Flowing fluids are circulated in passages inside 
the nut, and exchanges heat with the cooler as shown 
in the Figure 8.2  In cooperation with the hollow shaft 
design, it creates high quality thermal control and 
maintains high accuracy. This combination is most 
suitable for high-speed machine tools.

 • Features:
1. Optimized design for high reliability:
Through use of computer simulation and FEM 
analysis, the cool type ballscrew features excellent 
thermal protection and high reliability.      
2. Promote higher speed rotation and extra high 
Dm-N value (up to 200,000):
Cool type ballscrews will eliminate high-speed 
rotation aftereffect, i. e., thermal problems, and 
promote higher speed rotation. 
3. Prevent thermal distortion:
Optimized heat transfer design minimizes heat 
generation and prevents thermal distortion.
4. Strengthen durability:
When operating repeatedly, friction between balls 
causes heat generation. That may cause balls to 
oxidize or decarburize, and shorten the service life. 
Cool type ballscrews will strengthen durability under 
a cooling environment. 
5. Extended lubricant life cycle:
When using lubrication, minimum heat generation 
further inhibits deterioration in the quality of 
lubrication and extends the lubricant life cycle.
6. Keep temperature uniform and reduce warm-up 
time:
During high-speed operation, nut and shaft cooling 
effect keeps feed-system temperature constant and 
reduces warm-up time. 
7. Higher feeding accuracy: 
Cooling effect of cool type ballscrew will stabilize 
against thermal expansion and equalize feeding 
accuracy.

A1 Preface
In recent years, more and more ballscrews are installed in various machines to meet the requirements of 
higher accuracy and better performance.  Ballscrews have become one of the most widely used power transmission 
components.  In CNC machines, ballscrews help improve positioning accuracy and elongate service life. Ballscrews are 
also increasingly used to replace ACME screws in manually operated machines.
A ballscrew is normally preloaded to minimize the backlash of machine movement. Even a high precision ballscrew 
will not provide good accuracy and long service life if it is not installed properly.
This article discusses primary ballscrew problems and their precautions. Some measuring procedures are also 
discussed to help users locate the cause of an abnormal backlash.
A2 Causes and Precautions for Ballscrew Problems
Three major categories of ballscrew problems and their precautions are discussed as follows.
A2-1 Too much play
1. No preload or insufficient preload :
The ball nut will rotate and move downward by its own weight when a non-preloaded ballscrew is held vertically 
with the screw spindle constrained. A significant backlash may exist in a non-preloaded ballscrew unit.  Therefore nonpreload ballscrews are only used in machinery, where low operation resistance but not positioning accuracy is the major 
concern.
 HIWIN can determine the correct amount of preload based on different applications. We can also preset the amount 
of preload before shipment. Be sure to clearly specify the operation condition of your application when you order a 
ballscrew unit.
2. Too much torsional displacement :
(1) Incorrect heat treatment, hardened layer too thin, non-homogeneous hardness distribution, or material too soft: 
Standard hardness of steel balls, ball nuts, and screw spindles are HRC 62-66, 58-62, and 58-62, respectively.
(2) Incorrect design-L/D ratio too high, etc:
The lower the L/D (length/diameter) ratio, the more rigid the 
spindle is. L/D ratio should be limited to under 60.  (The accuracy grade 
related to this L/D range is shown in Table 4.10) There will be a significant 
deflection (torsional displacement ) if the L/D ratio is too high.The 
ballscrew installation shown in Fig A-1 is supported at one end only. This 
kind of “non-rigid” design should  be avoided if possible.
3. Inappropriate bearing selection :
Angular ball bearings should be used in ballscrew installation. A ball bearing with high pressure angle specially 
designed for ballscrew installation is an even a better choice. A regular deep groove ball bearing will generate a 
significant amount of axial play when axially loaded. It should not be used in this application.
4. Inappropriate bearing installation :
(1) If the bearing is not attached to the screw spindle properly, it will cause axial play under load. This problem 
may be caused by the bearing journal of the screw spindle being too long or the non-threaded part of the screw 
spindle being too short.
(2) The perpendicularity between the bearing seating face and the thread axis of the bearing locknut on the 
ballscrew, or the parallelism between the opposite faces of the locknut is out of tolerance causing the bearing to 
tilt. The thread for bearing lock nut and the seating face of a bearing in the ballscrew journal should be machined 
in one setting to ensure the perpendicularity. It is even better if they can be ground.
(3) Two lock nuts and a spring washer should be used in the bearing installation to prevent them from getting loose 
in operation.
Fig. A-1 The installation of ballscrews.

5. The ball nut housing or the bearing housing is not rigid enough :
The ball-nut-mounted housing or the bearing-mounted housing may deflect under components’ weight or 
machining load if it is not rigid enough. The test illustrated in Fig A-4 (d) can be used to check the rigidity of the ball-nutmounted housing.  Similar tests can be used to check the rigidity of the bearing-mounted housing.
6. The ball nut housing or the bearing housing is not mounted properly :
(1) Components may become loose due to vibration or lack of locating pin(s). Solid pins instead of spring pins 
should be used for locating purposes.
(2) Ball-nut-seated screws are not seated firmly because the screws are too long or the thread holes on housing are 
too short.
(3) Ball-nut-seated screws become loose due to vibration and lack of a spring washer.
7. Parallelism or flatness of the housing surface is out of tolerance :
In a machine assembly, a shim bar is frequently located between the housing location surface and the machine body 
for adjustment purpose. The clearance of table movement may vary at different locations if the parallelism or flatness of 
any matching component is out of tolerance no matter they are ground or scraped.
8. The motor and the ballscrew spindle are not assembled properly :
(1) There will be a relative rotation between the motor shaft and the ballscrew spindle if the connecting coupling is 
not installed firmly or the coupling itself is not rigid enough.
(2) Driving gears are not engaged properly or driving mechanism is not rigid. A timing belt should be used to prevent 
slipping if the ballscrew is to be driven by a belt.
(3) Key is loose in the groove. Any inappropriate match among the hub, key, and key seat may cause these 
components to generate backlash.
A2-2  Unsmooth operation
1. Defects from ballscrew manufacturing :
(1) The track surface of the ballscrew spindle or the ball nut is too rough.
(2) The roundness of the bearing balls, the ball nut or the ballscrew spindle is out of tolerance.
(3) The lead or the pitch circle diameter of the ball nut / the spindle is out of tolerance.
(4) The return tube is not attached to the ball nut appropriately.
(5) Uneven bearing ball size or hardness. The above problems should not be found in the manufacturers of top 
quality.
2. Foreign objects enter the ball path :
(1) Packing material is trapped in the ball path. Various materials and anti-rust paper are normally used to pack 
ballscrew units for shipment. It is possible to have these foreign materials or other objects trapped in the ball 
path if proper procedures are not followed while installing or aligning the ballscrew unit. This may cause the 
bearing balls to slide instead of rolling or even cause the ball nut to freeze completely.
(2) Machined chips get in the ball track. The chips or dust generated during machining processes may be trapped 
in the bearing ball track if wiper kits are not used to keep them away from the surface of the ballscrew unit. This 
may cause unsmooth operation, deteriorate accuracy and reduce service life.
3. Over-travel :
Over-travel can damage the return tube and cause it to collapse or even break. When this happens, the bearing balls 
will not circulate smoothly. They may break and damage the groove on the ball nut or the ballscrew spindle under severe 
circumstances. Over-travel may happen during set-up or as the result of a limit switch failure or a machine collision. To 
prevent further damage, an over-traveled ballscrew should be checked or repaired by the manufacturer before it goes 
back into service.
4. Damaged return tube:
The return tube may collapse and cause the same problems as mentioned above if it is hit heavily during installation.
5. Misalignment:
Radial load exists if the center line of the ball nut’s housing and the screw spindle’s bearing support housing are 


S99TE20-1610 197
not aligned properly. The ballscrew unit may bend if this misalignment is too large. An abnormal wear may still happen 
even if the misalignment is not significant enough to cause a noticeable bending. The accuracy of a ballscrew unit 
will deteriorate rapidly if it is misaligned. The higher the preload is set in the nut, the more demanding the alignment 
accuracy is required in the ballscrew.
6. The ball nut is not mounted properly on the nut housing:
Eccentric load exists when the mounted ball nut is tilted or misaligned. If this is the case, the motor current may 
fluctuate during rotation.
7. Ballscrew unit is damaged during transportation
A2-3  Fracture
1. Broken bearing ball :
Cr-Mo steel is the most commonly used material for bearing balls. It takes about 1,400kg (3,080LB) to 1,600kg 
(3,520LB) to break a steel ball of 3.175 mm (1/8 in) diameter. The temperature of an under-lubricated or non-lubricated 
ballscrew raises substantially during operation. This temperature rise could make the bearing balls brittle or break 
which causes damage to the grooves of the ball nut or the ballscrew spindle consequently.
Therefore, lubricant replenishment should be considered during the design process. If an automatic lubricating 
system is not available, a periodic grease replenishment should be scheduled as part of maintenance program.
2. Collapsed or broken return tube :
Over-travel of the ball nut or an impact on the return tube could cause the return tube to collapse or break. This 
may block the path of bearing balls and cause them to slide instead of rolling and eventually break.
3. Ballscrew spindle end breaks :
(1) Inappropriate design: Sharp corners on the ballscrew spindle should be avoided to reduce local stress 
concentration. (Fig. A2) shows some of the appropriate screw end designs.
(2) Bend of screw spindle journal: The seating surface of the bearing of the ballscrew and the thread axis of the 
bearing’s lock nut are not perpendicular to each other or the opposite sides of the lock nut are not parallel to 
each other. This will cause the end of screw spindle to bend and eventually break. The amount of deflection at the 
end of the ballscrew spindle (Fig A-3) before and after the bearing’s lock nut being tightened should not exceed 
0.01 mm (0.0004 in).
(3) Radial force or fluctuating stress: Misalignment in the ballscrew installation creates abnormal fluctuating shear 
stress and causes the ballscrew to fail prematurely.

A3 Locating the Cause of an Abnormal Backlash
The following measurement procedures can be performed to locate the cause of an abnormal backlash in the 
ballscrew installation.
1. Glue a gauge ball in the center hole at one end of the screw spindle.  Use the flat plate of a dial indicator to check 
the axial movement of this gauge ball in axial direction while rotating the screw spindle (Fig A-4(a)). The movement 
should not exceed 0.003mm (0.00012 in), if the bearing hub, the ball nut, and the ball nut housing are all installed 
properly.
2. Use a dial indicator to check the relative movement between the bearing housing and the bearing seat while 
rotating the ballscrew (Fig A-4(b)). Any dial indicator reading other than zero indicates that either the bearing hub is not 
rigid enough or it is not installed properly.
3. Check the relative movement between the machine table and the ball nut housing (Fig A-4(c)).
4. Check the relative movement between the ball nut housing and the ball nut flange (Fig A-4(d)).
Contact the ballscrew manufacturer if an unsatisfactory backlash still exits while all the above checks are ok. The 
preload or the rigidity of the ballscrew may have to be increased.
