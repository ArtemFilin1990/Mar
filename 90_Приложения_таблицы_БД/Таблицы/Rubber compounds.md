The COMPOUNDS division is specialized in producing and supplying 
rubber compounds for a number 
of internal and external customers. 
Besides, we have in portfolio vulcanized and unvulcanized sheets, unvulcanized strips and rubberized fabrics 
of different colour shades. After all, 
it is possible shaping of compounds 
into different confection for classic 
press or prepare rubber solutions for 
sticking rubber layers together.
Mixing of rubber compounds, 
production of rubberised textiles and cords
Almost all elastomers produced in the 
world are used in Rubena compounds. 
Their physical and mechanical properties, such as oil resistance, petrol 
resistance, ozone resistance, abrasion 
resistance, very little gas permeability, 
high and low-temperature resistance, 
thermal conductivity, permanent-deformation resistance, weatherproof 
ness, and combinations of these 
properties are given by the specific 
requirements for the final product. 
R&D engineers are ready to recommend you the most suitable compound for the given purpose.

Development
The well-equipped laboratory for the 
development and control of raw materials and products is ready to perform basic and advanced tests. Such 
a physical-mechanical and dynamic 
tests, rheology, and environmental 
tests. We have instruments with on-
-line display of results and traceability 
of individual tests.
Cooperation with technical universities and leading research institutes to 
improve our compounds is our standard. We provide our knowledge to 
invent new materials on the market.
