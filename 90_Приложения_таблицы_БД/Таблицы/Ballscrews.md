Ballscrews & Accessories
Ballscrews consist of a shaft, a nut into which the balls are 
integrated and the ball recirculation system. Ballscrews 
are the type of threaded shaft most commonly used in industrial and precision machines. They are used to convert 
rotary motion into longitudinal motion and vice versa. They 
display great accuracy and are highly efficient. HIWIN provides a large selection of ballscrews suitable for all your 
applications.
HIWIN ballscrews are distinguished by their low-friction 
and precise running, require little drive torque and offer 
good rigidity with smooth operation. HIWIN ballscrews are 
available in rolled, peeled and ground versions making 
them the optimum product for any application.

General information
2. General information
2.1 Properties
There are many benefits associated with HIWIN ballscrews including high efficiency, 
freedom from axial play, high rigidity and high lead accuracy. The characteristic 
properties and benefits of HIWIN ballscrews are described in detail below.
2.1.1 High efficiency in both directions
Thanks to the rolling contact between the shaft and nut, ballscrews can achieve an 
efficiency of up to 90 %.
The special surface treatment used on the ball tracks in HIWIN ballscrews reduces the 
frictional resistance between the ball and track.
The rolling motion of the balls only requires a low drive torque thanks to the high level 
of efficiency. Operating costs are therefore cut since less drive output is needed.

2.1.2 Zero play and high rigidity
The pointed profile HIWIN uses for ballscrew shafts and nuts allows the ballscrew nuts 
to be assembled without any axial play. A preload is usually used to achieve the good 
overall rigidity and repeatability.

2.1.3 High lead accuracy
For applications requiring very high levels of accuracy, our production meets the 
requirements of ISO and JIS standards; but we manufacture to customer specifications 
too.
Accuracy is guaranteed by testing with our laser measurement systems and documented for the customer.


2.1.4 Reliable service life
Whereas the life of standard screw drives is determined by wear on the contact 
surfaces, HIWIN ballscrews can be used virtually up until the end of the metalʼs 
fatigue life. Great care is exercised in development, choice of material, heat treatment 
and manufacturing, as is demonstrated by the reliability and resilience of HIWIN 
ballscrews over their nominal service life. With every kind of ballscrew, the service 
2.1.5 Low starting torque with smooth operation
The rolling friction of the balls in ballscrews only requires a very low starting torque. 
To achieve precise ball tracks, HIWIN uses a special design (adaptation factor) and 
special production procedures. This guarantees that the motorʼs drive torque remains 
in the range required.
In one particular step of manufacturing, HIWIN can check the profile of every single 
ball track. A sample report of this test is shown in Fig. 2.3.

life depends on several influencing factors including design aspects, material quality, 
maintenance and most importantly the dynamic load rating (Cdyn).
Profile accuracy, material properties and surface hardness are the fundamental factors 
affecting the dynamic load rating.
Using computer-based measuring systems, the friction torque of every ballscrew is 
recorded and documented with great accuracy at HIWIN. Fig. 2.4 shows typical torque 
progress over travel.
2.1.6 Special solutions
HIWIN manufactures ballscrews in line with customer drawings or with HIWIN 
standard end machining. For the ballscrew definition the requirements on the 
project planning sheet must be documented and checked. This ensures that the 
ballscrew is ideally adapted to the requirements in place.


3. Structural properties and selection of HIWIN ballscrews
3.1 Design information
a)	
Select a suitable ballscrew for your application (see Table 3.5). The relevant 
requirements must be noted for installation. For precision-ground ballscrews 
with CNC machines, this means careful alignment and the corresponding type 
of installation; for applications requiring less precision, we recommend rolled 
ballscrews, which require less work when designing the type of installation and 
bearings.
Radial load
Moment load
b)	 It is particularly important that the bearing housing and ballscrew nut are assembled axially parallel; otherwise uneven load distribution would result. Radial and 
torque loads are also among the factors which result in uneven load distribution 
(see Fig. 3.1). This can cause functional limitations and shorten the service life 
(see Fig. 3.2).
c)
	Select the right type of bearing for the ballscrew shaft. When used in CNC 
machines, we recommend angular ball bearings (angle = 60°) because of 
their higher axial load capacity and the fact that they permit zero-backlash or 
pre-loaded installation.
	A selection of possible end machining processes and suitable floating and fixed 
bearings are listed in Chapter 8 onwards.

angle or error in aligning the nut flange
Fig. 3.2 Impacts on life expectancy of radial load caused by insufficient alignment


d)	 Precautionary measures must be taken to stop the ballscrew nut once the useful 
path has been exceeded (see Fig. 3.3). Travel against an axial fixed stop results in 
damage.
e)
	In environments with high levels of dust or metal debris, ballscrews should be 
provided with a telescopic or bellows shaft protection (see Fig. 3.4).
f)
	When using an internal or end cap ball recirculation system, the ball thread 
must be cut to the end of the shaft. The diameter of the adjacent bearing journal 
must be around 0.5 –1.0 mm less than the core diameter of the ball tracks (see 
Fig. 3.5).
g)	 While surface-hardening the shafts, 2 to 3 thread turns are left unhardened 
on the two ends adjacent to the bearings so that connection modifications are 
possible. These areas are marked with the symbol in HIWIN drawings (see Fig. 
3.6). Please contact HIWIN if you have special requirements for these areas.
h) 	Excess preload results in increased friction torque which in turn causes heating 
and therefore a reduced service life. On the other hand, insufficient preload 
reduces rigidity and increases the risk of backlash. For details, see Sections 3.6
and 3.7.7.

3.3 Ballscrew shafts
HIWIN offers rolled, peeled and ground ballscrews – depending on the application 
requirements. For the selection of the appropriate shaft the individual characteristics 
are listed in Table 3.2.
3.4 Ball recirculation systems
HIWIN ballscrews are available with three different recirculation systems.
The external recirculation system consists of the return tubes and the clamping plate. 
The balls are placed in the ball track between the ballscrew shaft and nut. At the end 
of the nut, they are guided out of the ball track and back to the start via a return tube; 
ball circulation is therefore a closed circuit (see Fig. 3.7).

Fig. 3.7 External recirculation type nut
Fig. 3.8 Internal single recirculation type nut
Fig. 3.9 Endcap recirculation type nut
In the case of the internal single recirculation, the balls are each fed back to the 
beginning of a thread turn with the help of the deflecting parts. The balls undertake 
just one circuit around the shaft. The circuit is closed by a deflecting part in the 
ballscrew nut and allows the balls to return to the start via the rear of the thread. The 
position of the ball deflection in the nut gives the internal single recirculation system 
its name (see Fig. 3.8).
The third type of return is the endcap recirculation system shown in Fig. 3.9. It has 
the same basic principle as the external return, however, the balls are returned via a 
channel in the ballscrew nut. The balls perform one complete cycle in the ballscrew 
nut. The endcap return is also called “internal total recirculation”.

3.6 Preload and play
The axial force Fa, caused by outer drive forces or inner preload forces, produces two 
kinds of axial play. Firstly, axial play Sa, that originates from the air between the ball 
and ball track. Secondly, the spring compression play ∆l, caused by the force Fn, 
which acts vertically on the point of contact.
By default, rolled and peeled ballscrews are delivered with slight play. This is sufficient for most applications, and has the advantage that the ballscrews run smoothly 
and a low starting torque is required.
If increased demands are placed on the positioning accuracy and rigidity, the ballscrew 
should be used with no axial play or preloaded. For preloading, different methods are 
available, which are explained below.

3.6.1 HIWIN types of preload 
Preload can be generated either with double nuts, or single nuts with lead offset or in 
the case of preloaded single nuts by adjusting the ball size.
Preloaded single nuts
There are two kinds of preload for the single nuts. One of these is the “preload method 
with oversized balls”. This involves balls which are slightly larger than the space in the 
ball tracks between spindle and nut; the ball therefore makes contact at four points 
(see Fig. 3.16).
The other method is known as “preload from lead offset” (see Fig. 3.17). The nut is 
ground such that it is offset from the central lead. This type of preload takes the place 
of the classic double nut preload and offers the benefit that a compact single nut with 
good rigidity can be used with low preload forces. This method is not, however, suited 
to use with high preloads and high leads. The recommend preload force is less than 
5 % of the dynamic load rating (C).

Fig. 3.18 Preload from spacer
Preloaded double nuts
The preload is generated by inserting a spacer between the nuts (see Fig. 3.18). The 
O preload results from fitting an oversized spacer which pushes the halves of the 
nut apart. The X preload is generated with an undersized spacer which pulls the nuts 
together. 
3.6.2 Effects of preload
Preload increases the thread’s friction torque and therefore causes increases in 
temperature during operation. To ensure a long service life and low increase in 
temperature, the maximum preload should not exceed 5 % of the dynamic load rating 
for single nuts and 10 % for double nuts.
Furthermore preload has an effect on the running characteristics. Besides an increase 
in idle torque it leads to fluctuations in idle torque, especially with ballscrews with 
high tolerance classes. (see Section 3.6.3).
Basically, ballscrews should only be preloaded when it is absolutely necessary to avoid 
axial play.

3.6.3 Idle torque fluctuation
(1) Measuring method
Preload produces a friction torque between nut and threaded shaft. This is measured 
by moving the threaded shaft at constant speed while holding the nut with a special 
locking device (see Fig. 3.19).
The force FPr measured by the force sensor is used to calculate the idle torque of the
threaded shaft.

3.7 Calculations
Bases of calculations in accordance with DIN ISO 3408.
3.7.1 Load ratings
Dynamic load rating Cdyn (theoretical)
The dynamic load rating describes the load at which 90 % of all ballscrews reach a life 
expectancy of 1 × 106 revolutions (C). The reliability factor can be taken into account 
in accordance with Table 3.17. The dynamic load rating is listed in the dimensions 
tables for the nuts.
Static load rating C0
The static load rating describes the load which causes permanent deformation of the 
ball track of more than 0.0001 of the ball diameter. In order to calculate the maximum 
static load rating, the static structural safety S0 of the application conditions must be 
taken into account.

3.7.7 Rigidity
Rigidity describes the flexibility of a machine element. The overall rigidity of a 
ballscrew is determined by the axial rigidity of the nut/shaft system, the contact rigidity of the ball track and the rigidity of the threaded shaft. The following factors should 
also be taken into account when fitting the ballscrew in a machine: rigidity of support 
bearings, assembly conditions of nuts with table etc.
The rigidity of the nut/shaft unit and the ball and ball track can be combined to 
produce the rigidity of the nut Rn, which is listed in the dimensions tables for the 
different types of nuts.

Information about checking
Oil
Check oil level once a week and check oil for contamination
If contaminated, we recommend changing the oil
Grease
Check grease for contamination every two to three months
If contaminated, replace old grease with new grease
Always replace grease on an annual basis
3.8.2 Heat treatment
Table 3.19 shows the hardness of the main components used in HIWIN ballscrews. The 
surface hardness of the ballscrew affects both the dynamic and the static load rating. 
The dynamic and static load ratings listed in the dimensions tables are based on a 
surface hardness equivalent to HRC 60. For surface hardnesses of less than this, the 
load ratings can be determined using the following calculation.
3.9 Lubrication
HIWIN ballscrews can be lubricated with grease, semi-fluid grease or oil depending on 
the application. They are supplied preserved as standard and must never be taken into 
service without initial lubrication. For information about the initial greasing, amounts 
of lubricant and lubrication intervals, please consult the assembly instructions 
“Ballscrews”.

4. Rolled ballscrews
4.1 Properties
One of the benefits of rolled ballscrews is that feed systems equipped with them have 
less friction and are quieter than standard threads.
HIWIN manufactures them using state-of-the-art rolling technologies where the 
processes of material selection, rolling, heat treatment, machining and assembly are 
very closely coordinated.
Rolled ballscrews from HIWIN can be flexibly used in virtually all areas of industry. 
Rolled ballscrew shafts with diameters of 8 mm to 63 mm are always kept in stock and 
can be supplied at short notice. They can be supplied with or without end machining. 
Complete bearing units combined with standardised shaft ends enable us to supply 
complete ballscrews.
4.2 Tolerance classes
Table 4.1 shows the tolerance classes of rolled ballscrews. The lead accuracy is 
defined using the deviation from nominal path over any 300 mm section of the entire 
length. The path deviation over the entire useful path is determined by formula F 3.1 
on Page 16.

Peeled ballscrews
5. Peeled ballscrews
5.1 Properties
In terms of quality, peeled ballscrews from HIWIN fall between rolled and ground 
ballscrews and can therefore be used for numerous transport or positioning 
applications. On request, we are happy to produce a lead measurement report for 
them. A number of nut shapes are available for peeled ballscrews, as both single and 
double nuts. Customised complete ballscrews can be produced with short lead times. 
Complete bearing units combined with standardised shaft ends minimise the amount 
of design work involved.
5.2 Tolerance classes
Table 5.1 shows the tolerance classes of peeled ballscrews. The lead accuracy is 
defined using the deviation from nominal path over any 300 mm section of the entire 
length.

5.4.6 Safety nut SEM
The safety nut comprises a ball thread unit and safety unit. The safety nut basically 
works like a normal ballscrew nut. If the axial play is increased due to wear, ball failure or ball loss, the thread of the safety unit comes into contact with the ball thread. 
The nut cannot therefore break out. The normal function of the unit is guaranteed up 
to an axial play of 0.4 mm.

Ground ballscrews
6. Ground ballscrews
6.1 Properties
Of the various production methods used for ballscrews, ground ballscrews offer the 
greatest accuracy. Ballscrews with a lead accuracy of up to 3.5 μm/300 mm thread 
length can be produced by grinding after hardening. They are used mainly in machine 
tools, grinding machines and measuring machines.
Ground ballscrews are always customized, enabling the customer’s requirements 
relating to nut shape, load ratings, preload method, wiper type and end machining to 
be met. Contact our team for more details.
Below you will find typical standardized nut shapes, nominal diameters and leads. This 
is just part of our range. We can provide other nut dimensions on request.

8. Shaft ends and accessories
8.1 Shaft ends and bearing configuration
To reduce the amount of design work required, we provide standardised end machining 
processes and bearing units. We recommend the “B”, “E” and “F” bearing series for 
simple transport applications and low axial forces. The SFA and SLA bearing units are 
suited to more challenging precision applications. The WBK series is available for 
heavy-duty applications.
When selecting the suitable bearing type, the permissible axial force of the fixed 
bearing must also be taken into account.

8.2 WBK bearing series
series are especially suited to use in heavy-duty ballscrews. Depending on the axial 
loads present, the WBK bearing units are available with the DF, DFD and DFF bearing 
arrangements.
The end machining processes suited to the WBK fixed bearing are types W1, W2 and 
W3 (Section 8.1).

8.3 SFA/SLA bearing series
8.3.1 Fixed bearing SFA
The axis height of the fixed bearing is matched to supported bearing SLA (Section 
8.3.2) and nut housing GFD (Section 8.4). The pillow block can be screwed on from 
above (S1) and below (S2).
