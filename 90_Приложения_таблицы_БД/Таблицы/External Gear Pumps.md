 General
 Rexroth external gear pumps are available as standard gear 
pumps in the 4 series of B, F, N and G and as SILENCE gear 
pumps in the series of S, T and U, in which the displacements 
are graded by different gear widths. Further configuration 
 variants are given by different flanges, shafts, valve arrangements and multiple pump combinations.

 Construction
The external gear pump consists essentially of a pair of gears 
supported in bearing bushings and the case with a front and 
a rear cover. The drive shaft protrudes from the front cover 
where it is sealed by the shaft seal ring. The bearing forces are 
absorbed by special bearing bushings with sufficient elasticity 
to produce surface contact instead of line contact. They also 
ensure excellent resistance to galling – especially at low speed. 
The gears have 12 teeth. This keeps both flow pulsation and 
noise emission to a minimum.
Gear pump axial compensation
The internal sealing is achieved by forces which are proportional to delivery pressure. This ensures optimum efficiency. The 
bearings provide the seal at the ends of the gaps between the 
teeth which carry the pressurized oil. The sealing zone between 
the gear teeth and the bearing is controlled by the admission of 
operating pressure to the rear of the bearing bushings. Special 
seals form the boundary of the zone. The radial clearance at the 
tips of the gear teeth is sealed by internal  forces pushing them 
against the case.

 Gear pumps with 
integral valves
 In order to reduce external pipework it is possible to incorporate a flow-control valve or pressure-relief valve in the rear 
 cover of the gear pump. A typical application of this is in the 
supply of hydraulic oil in power steering systems. The pump 
delivers a constant flow irrespective of the speed at which it is 
driven. The excess flow is either returned internally to the suction port or distributed externally to other items of equipment.

 Drive arrangements
1. Flexible couplings
The coupling must not transfer any radial 
or axial forces to the pump.
The maximum radial runout of shaft 
 spigot is 0.2 mm.
Refer to the fitting instructions provided 
by the coupling manufacturer for details 
of the maximum permitted shaft misalignment.
2. Coupling sleeve
Used on shafts with DIN or SAE splining.
Caution: There must be no radial or 
axial forces exerted on the pump shaft 
or coupling sleeve. The coupling sleeve 
must be free to move axially. The distance between the pump shaft and drive 
shaft must be 2+1. Oil-bath or oil-mist 
lubrications is necessary.
3. Drive shaft with tang
For the close-coupling of the pumps 
to electric motor or internal-combustion 
engine, gear, etc. 
The pump shaft has a special tang and 
driver 3 (not included in supply). 
There is no shaft sealing.
The recommended arrangements and 
 dimensions for the drive end and sealing 
are as follows.
 Drive shaft
Case-hardening steel DIN 17 210
e.g. 20 MnCrS 5
case-hardened 0.6 deep; HRC 60 ±3.
Surface for sealing ring
ground without rifling Rmax.  4μm
 Radial shaft seal ring
Rubber-covered seal (see DIN 3760, 
Type AS or double-lipped ring).
Cut 15° chamfer or fit shaft seal ring 
with protection sleeve.

4.  V-belts and straight gearwheels or 
helical toothed gear drives without 
outboard bearing
When proposing to use V-belt or gear 
drive, please submit details of the 
application for our comments (especially 
dimensions a, dm, dw and angle α).
For helical toothed gear drives, details 
of the helix angle  are also required.
5. Outboard bearing
Outboard bearing eliminate possible 
problems when the pumps are driven by 
V-belts or gearwheels. The diagrams 
 below show the maximum radial and axial 
loads that can be tolerated based on 
a bearing life of LH = 1000 hours.

Multiple gear pumps
Gear pumps are well-suited to tandem combinations of 
pumps in which the drive shaft of the first pump is extended to 
drive a second pump and sometimes a third pump in the same 
manner. A coupling is fitted between each pair of pumps.
In most cases each pump is isolated from its neighbor, i.e. the 
suction ports are separate from one another. A common suction 
port is also possible as an option.
Caution: Basically, the specifications for the single pumps 
 apply, but with certain restrictions:
Max. speed: This is determined by the highest rated pump 
speed in use.
Pressures: These are restricted by the strength of the drive 
shaft, the through drives and the drivers. Appropriate data is 
given in the dimensional drawings.
Pressure restrictions during standard through drive
In the case of series S, the driver for the second pumping 
stage can carry a load of up to Mmax. = 65 Nm, i.e. there is a 
pressure restriction for the second stage and any further stages.
If the first stage is driven through a tang (driver) or outboard 
bearing type 1, pressure restrictions apply as indicated in the 
formula below.
Reinforced through drives are available for applications with 
higher transfer torques and/or rotational vibrations. Customized 
designs available on request.

Notes for commissioning
Filter recommendation
The major share of premature failures in external gear pumps is 
caused by contaminated hydraulic fluid. 
As a warranty cannot be issued for dirt-specific wear, we recommended filtration compliant with cleanliness level 20/18/15 
ISO 4406, which reduces the degree of contamination to 
a permissible dimension in terms of the size and concentration 
of dirt particles:
Operating pressure [bar ]
>160
<160
Contamination class ISO 4406
18/15
19/16
To be reached with βX = 75
We recommend that a full-flow filter always be used.
Basic contamination of the hydraulic fluid used may not 
exceed class 20/18/15 according to ISO 4406. Experience has 
shown that new fluid quite often lies above this value. In such 
instances a filling device with special filter should be used.
General
– The pumps supplied by us have been checked for function 
and performance. No modifications of any kind may 
be made to the pumps; any such changes will render the 
warranty null and void!
– Pump may only be operated in compliance with permitted 
data (see pages 15 – 18).
Project planning notes
Comprehensive notes and suggestions are available in 
Hydraulics Trainer, Volume 3 RE 00 281, “Project planning 
notes and design of hydraulic systems”. Where external gear 
pumps are used we recommend that the following note be 
adhered to.
Technical data
All stated technical data is dependent on production toler ances 
and is valid for specific marginal conditions.
Note that, as a consequence, scattering is possible, and at 
certain marginal conditions (e.g. viscosity) the technical data 
may change.
Characteristics
When designing the external gear pump, note the maximum 
possible service data based on the characteristics displayed 
on pages 10 to 12.
Additional information on the proper handling of hydraulic 
products from Bosch Rexroth is available in our document: 
“General product information for hydraulic products” 
RE 07 008.
Contained in delivery
The components with characteristics as described under 
ordering code and device measurements, pages 20 – 58, 
are contained in delivery.
You can find further information in our publication:
“General Operating Instructions for External Gear Units”
RE 07 012-B1.

The AZ configurator at www.boschrexroth.com/azconfigurator
The AZ configurator assists you to configure your individual external gear unit 
easily and user-friendly. You only need to 
specify your requirements: From the 
displacement, direction of rotation, drive 
shaft, connection flange right up to the 
required rear cover. You  immediately 
receive a project drawing (PDF format) if 
a configuration already exists. You receive 
the price of the configured external gear 
unit upon request.
The AZ configurator 
assists you to configure 
your individual external 
gear unit easily and userfriendly – all data needed 
for project planning are 
acquired thru menu guidance.
Selection is made either 
on an  ordering code or 
your technical requirements. This means that 
you can search for external gear units that have 
already been configured, 
or you specify the configuration variant of the 
external gear unit based 
upon the operating parameters you require.
If the external gear unit 
you selected has been 
 released you will receive 
the part number, ordering 
code and a detailed 
installation drawing. If 
your special configuration 
is not available please 
send your specification 
to Rexroth. One of our 
employees will then contact you.
