●Shell Type Caged Needle Roller Bearings
●Shell Type Grease Retained Full Complement Needle Roller Bearings
■Structure and features
IKO Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings are lightweight bearings with large load ratings.  They employ 
a shell type outer ring made from a thin special-steel 
plate which is accurately drawn, carburized and 
quenched, thus providing the lowest sectional height 
among the needle roller bearings.
There are two types of bearings available in this 
series; the caged type and the full complement type. 
The appropriate type can be selected according to the 
operating conditions.  The caged type has a structure 
in which the needle rollers are accurately guided by 
the cage and thrust rings.  It is useful for applications 
at high-speed rotation.  The full complement type needle roller bearing, on the other hand, is suitable for 
heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation.
Since these bearings are press-fitted into the housing, 
no fixtures for axial positioning are needed.  They are 
ideal for use in mass-produced articles that require 
economy, and have a wide variety of applications.

■Types
Numerous varieties of Shell Type Needle Roller 
Bearings are available as shown in Table 1.
Shell Type Caged Needle Roller Bearings
Standard type
This type has a narrow gap between the bore of the 
marked-side flange of the outer ring (brand, bearing 
number, etc. are marked) and the shaft, which prevents grease leaks and the entry of foreign particles. 
This type has wide applications.
Closed end type
This type is completely closed on one side of the 
outer ring, and is ideal for use when perfect closing of 
shaft ends is desired.
The shape of the closed end surface of the outer ring 
is divided into two types, and the dimensions t1 and t2 
in the illustrations shown in the dimension tables 
apply to the bearings with the roller set bore diameters, Fw > 22 and Fw ≦ 22, respectively.
Type with seals at both sides
This type has a wider outer ring than the standard 
type and is installed with seals consisting of a reinforcing ring and special synthetic rubber to prevent 
grease leaks and the entry of foreign particles.
Shell Type Grease Retained Full Complement 
Needle Roller Bearings
This type has full complement rollers which extend to 
the full width of the outer ring raceway.  It can, therefore, withstand heavy bearing loads and is most suitable for low and medium rotational speeds as well as 
rocking motions.  As lubricating grease is prepacked 
with the rollers, the bearing can be operated immediately after being fitted.

type with one seal is required, please consult IKO.
Remark　A "W" is added to the model code to indicate that the 
rolling elements are of the double-row type.
　　　　  Example　TAW 5045 Z
■Identification Number
The identification number of Shell Type Needle Roller 
Bearings consists of a model code and dimensions. 
Examples of the arrangement are shown below.
When using with inner rings, the assembled inner 
rings shown in the dimension tables are used.  An 
example in this case is also shown below.  Inner rings 
are delivered separately.
■Accuracy
The outer rings of Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings 
are thin and therefore cannot avoid deformation due 
to heat treatment.  It is thus not appropriate to take 
direct measurements of the bearing.  The roller set 
bore diameter is measured using a plug gauge or 
tapered gauge after press-fitting the bearing to a suitable ring gauge.  The gauge specifications are shown 
in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.
Tolerances of outer ring width C are shown in Table 
3.

■Fit
As the outer ring is thin, the correct dimensions and 
accuracy of Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings are 
obtained only after they have been press-fitted into 
the housing bore. Bearing accuracy is directly affected by housing dimensions, shape and rigidity.  This 
should be taken into account when considering fit and 
accuracy.  The radial clearance after fitting the bearing to the shaft and the housing bore varies with their 
tolerances.
Table 4 shows the recommended fit for Shell Type 
Needle Roller Bearings.
Table 5 shows a calculation example of radial clearance after fitting.  This calculation applies to bearings 
without inner ring to be fitted into rigid steel or cast 
iron housings.  When the housing is made of light 
alloy or a thin steel pipe, it is necessary to check 
dimensions by actual measurement.
Generally, when making the radial clearance smaller, 
it is recommended that the shaft diameter be 
increased, without decreasing the housing bore diameter.

Note(1)　When housings are made of light alloy or a thin steel pipe, the roller set bore diameter is greatly affected by the housing thickness and 
shape.  Therefore, before mass-production assembly, assembly tests should be carried out to confirm the amount of dimensional 
change and to determine the tolerance of the shaft which will give normal clearances.
Calculation procedure

         Max. value of housing bore (Dmax): See the dimension table. 
         Min. value of housing bore (Dmin): See the dimension table.

         Max. value of radial clearance(Gr max)＝Fwe max−Fmin

From Table 2.1 on page B4

Fw max	＝20.028
Fw min	＝20.007
From the dimension table on page B14,

From the equations,
Fwe max＝20.049
Fwe min ＝20.007
From the dimension table on page B14,
Fmax ＝20.000
Fmin ＝19.987
From the equations,

■Lubrication
■Oil Hole
Bearings with prepacked grease are shown in Table 
6.  ALVANIA GREASE S2 (Shell Lubricants Japan 
K.K.) is prepacked as the lubricating grease.
In the case of bearings without prepacked grease, 
perform proper lubrication for use.  If the bearings are 
operated without lubrication, the wear of the roller 
contact surfaces will increase and the bearing life will 
be shortened.
For Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings with an oil 
hole, "OH" is appended to the end of the identification 
number.
　Example　TA  2525  Z  OH
The symbol "OH" is not marked on the bearing itself, 
but is shown on its packaging, etc.  When bearings 
with multiple oil holes are required, please consult 
IKO.
■Mounting
Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings should be pressed 
into the housings gently using the appropriate tool as 
shown in Fig. 1, with their marked end surface up.  As 
the outer ring is thin, it must never be struck directly 
with a hammer.
Since the outer rings of Shell Type Needle Roller 
Bearings are firmly fitted to housing bores with interference, it is unnecessary to fix them axially.  Fig. 2 
shows mounting examples.
■Specifications of shaft and housing
Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings are commonly 
used without an inner ring.  In such cases, the surface 
hardness of the raceway surface should be 58 〜
64HRC and the surface roughness should not exceed 
0.2 μ mRa.  However, when the operating condition is 
not severe, a surface roughness 0.8μmRa or less 
can be used.
If the surface hardness is low, the load rating must be 
corrected by the hardness factor shown on page A20. 
When the shaft cannot be heat treated and finished 
by grinding, the use of IKO Inner Rings for Shell Type 
Needle Roller Bearings (See page H1.) is recommended.
■Static Safety Factor
Since Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings employ an 
outer ring made from a thin steel plate which is drawn, 
carburized and quenched, excessively large loads 
must be avoided.  The required static safety factor is 
usually more than 3.
