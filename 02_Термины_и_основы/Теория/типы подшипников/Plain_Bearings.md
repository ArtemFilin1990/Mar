Quality,
manufacturing technology,
environmental protection
“Zero defects” is our quality objective. We have matched all our 
processes to this target. In addition, our many years of experience
in forming, forging, heat treatment, surface technologies, grinding, 
honing and assembly ensures that our products fulfil the required 
quality level.
Ongoing quality inspections are a defined component of the manu-
facturing process. These are integrated directly as a feedback 
function in the manufacturing process. This ensures that all products 
continuously fulfil the same high standard of quality.
The quality of our products and processes is certified; for example, 
all manufacturing facilities are certified in accordance with 
DIN EN ISO 9001 and ISO/TS 16949.
With the validation and certification of our manufacturing sites,
we are taking a pioneering role in environmental protection.
All larger manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 14001 and are also 
validated in accordance with the more stringent EC Eco-Management 
and Audit Scheme (EMAS).
Worldwide presence
Through a closely knit network of development and manufacturing 
sites, sales companies and an international distribution structure, 
we are represented throughout the world. This global presence 
ensures effective linkage between the major markets in Europe, 
India, South East Asia/Pacific Region, East Asia, North and 
South America.
As a result, we have an on-site presence with service and technical 
advice in close proximity to the customer.
We take orders from throughout the world and make deliveries 
worldwide too. Furthermore, we support our customers worldwide
in resolving their bearing arrangement requirements, respond
to technical queries and develop specific bearing arrangement 
solutions in local partnership with our customers.
Plain bearings catalogue HG 1
Catalogue HG 1, Plain Bearings, describes the product range
of spherical plain bearings and rod ends of the ELGES brand
as well as plain bushes, thrust washers and strips of the INA brand. 
It incorporates the complete revision of Catalogue 238 and 
Catalogue 706 as well as other products such as ELGOTEX® plain 
bearings.
An engineering compendium
Since the introduction of the spherical plain bearing, ELGES 
spherical plain bearings and ELGES rod ends have had a decisive 
influence on the development and technological progress of these 
precision components. This has led to extensive product innovations 
and many pioneering applications only became possible due
to the know-how of the company group. Furthermore, the new 
maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® bearings – as spherical plain bearings 
or combinations of radial, angular contact and axial bearings – 
continue in the tradition of this product group for state-of-the-art 
engineering and economical bearing solutions.

Spherical plain bearings and
rod ends
Spherical plain bearings are ready-to-fit precision machine 
elements. Due to the outer ring with its concave inner slideway and 
the inner ring with its crowned outer slideway, they can perform 
spatial adjustment motions. The bearings can support static loads 
and are suitable for tilt and swivel motion. They can compensate for 
shaft misalignment, are not subject to edge stresses under misalign-
ment and allow substantial manufacturing tolerances in the adjacent 
construction.
Rod ends are spherical plain bearing units. They comprise a housing 
and integral shank, into which a spherical plain bearing is inte-
grated, and have an external or internal thread. Rod ends are used
as connecting levers and connecting rods and as connecting 
elements between cylinders and their adjacent parts in hydraulic 
and pneumatic cylinders.
Spherical plain bearings and rod ends are available in numerous 
designs, dimension series and versions. They have high operational 
security and a long operating life. Maintenance-free versions are 
available with the sliding layers ELGOGLIDE®, PTFE composite and 
PTFE film. Versions requiring maintenance have steel/steel or 
steel/bronze sliding contact surfaces and can be easily relubricated.
Plain bushes,
thrust washers and strips
Plain bushes, thrust washers and strips are used not only for rotary 
and oscillating motion but also for linear motion with short or long 
stroke lengths. In the case of maintenance-free bearings with
the sliding material E40, lubrication is not necessary at any point 
during the operating life due to the use of PTFE as a dry lubricant.
The low-maintenance bearings with the sliding material E50 receive 
an initial lubrication at the start of operation. Since the sliding layer 
has lubrication pockets, this initial lubrication is sufficient in most 
cases.
All metal/polymer composite plain bearings are free from lead
in accordance with the End of Life Vehicles Directive, Directive 
2000/53/EC as well as the Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS-II) for the 
restriction of hazardous substances. They are thus environmentally 
safe.
In addition to the polymer composite plain bearings with the sliding 
materials E40 and E50, there are also plain bushes with ELGOGLIDE® 
and ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes.
Current level of technology
The data represent the state of current technology and manufacture 
as at April 2014. They take account of the progress in rolling
bearing technology as well as the experience gained in numerous 
applications.
Any data in earlier publications that do not correspond to the data
in this catalogue are therefore invalid.

Foreword
Definition
of the Attention symbol
This catalogue gives descriptions of standard and special bearings. 
Since these are used in numerous applications, we cannot make
a judgement as to whether any malfunctions will cause harm to 
persons or property.
Follow instructions
It is always and fundamentally the responsibility of the designer and 
user to ensure that all specifications are observed and that all 
necessary information is communicated to the end user. This applies 
in particular to applications in which product failure and malfunction 
may constitute a hazard to human beings.
If guidelines marked with the Attention symbol are not observed, 
damage or malfunctions in the product or the adjacent construction 
may occur.
X-life is the premium brand of Schaeffler. Plain bearings identified
as X-life have even higher performance materials, lower coefficients 
of friction and lower running-in wear than comparable bearings.
X-life bearings are described in the sections on product features and 
are indicated in the dimension tables by the symbol XL.

Selection of the correct plain bearing
Areas of application
Plain bearings from Schaeffler are used under high specific loads 
and various possible types of motion, from swivel type motion
to overlaid motion. They are ideally suited to intermittent operation 
occurring on a periodic or non-periodic basis.
The plain bearings are bearings for very small radial or axial design 
envelopes where high load carrying capacity is nevertheless 
required. They can also be used under vibration coinciding with 
small amounts of motion. The bearings offer excellent damping 
characteristics especially under static loading, such as those 
required under shock loads.
Many of the plain bearings are destined for maintenance-free 
applications and in cases where long rating values are required.
Requirements
of the application
Plain bearings from Schaeffler are available in various bearing types, 
designs and sizes as well as with different plain bearing materials.
Selection of the suitable bearing is dependent principally
on the requirements of the application. These include:
■load conditions
– type of load
– direction of load
– magnitude of load
■motion conditions
– type of motion
– direction of motion
– frequency of motion
■adjacent construction
– available design envelope
– shaft, housing
■rating life requirement
■environmental influences
– temperature
– influence of media
– contamination
– lubrication.

Selection by bearing type
Depending on the type of plain bearing and the typical geometrical 
structure in the particular case, there are different possibilities
for support of load and degrees of freedom of motion. Some bearing 
types facilitate additional functions such as the compensation
of angular misalignment, see table.
Selection of the suitable spherical plain bearing for combined load 
is dependent on the ratio between the radial and axial force,
see page 38.

Selection of the correct plain bearing
Operating limits
of plain bearing materials
The suitability of a plain bearing material can be estimated from
the particular operating limits of the specific bearing load, Figure 1.
Further operating limits are determined from the comparison
of sliding velocity, see table, page 29, the pv diagram,
Figure 2, page 29, the temperature resistance, Figure 3, page 29, 
and the coefficient of friction, table, page 71.
Schaeffler recommends the use of the sliding layer ELGOGLIDE® under 
dynamic bearing loads in the range from 25 N/mm2 to 300 N/mm2.
The sliding layer ELGOGLIDE®-W11 should be used in preference
in the range from 1 N/mm2 to 100 N/mm2. If the specific load is 
outside these ranges, the other ELGOGLIDE® sliding layer is 
recommended.
For static loads of more than 180 N/mm2, the design of ELGOTEX®
filament wound bushes must be checked by the Schaeffler 
engineering service. For loads at or over this range, we alternatively 
recommend the use of ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes.
The actual load carrying capacity of a plain bearing is dependent
on the material of the sliding layer and the supporting body as well
as on the bearing geometry and the adjacent construction. The data 
and guidelines in the product chapters must be observed.

Selection of the correct plain bearing
Estimation
of the sliding distance
If the rating life is the decisive selection criterion, a simple estimate 
of the achievable sliding distance can be made for maintenance-free 
and low-maintenance plain bearings. The sliding distance is
the distance covered by the mating body along the sliding surface.
The failure mechanism of maintenance-free and low-maintenance 
plain bearing materials is based on wear. The sliding distance s can 
therefore be determined from a diagram as a function of the specific 
load p, Figure 4.
In the case of plain bearing materials requiring maintenance,
the failure mechanism is based on material fatigue. An estimate
of the sliding distance cannot therefore be made in the case
of steel/steel and steel/bronze sliding contact surfaces.
The achievable sliding distance applies if all other factors 
influencing the rating life are assumed to be ideal.

Predimensioning
In the case of spherical plain bearings, predimensioning can be 
carried out in order to estimate the bearing size.
Predimensioning of the bearing size is carried out on the basis of:
■the ratio C/P
– basic load rating C, see dimension tables
– the bearing load P, see page 36
■the type of load (alternating or unilateral)
■the magnitude of the load
■the bearing series.
The ratio Cr/P or Ca/P is dependent on the series and must not be 
 1.
Predimensioning for spherical plain bearings is not a substitute
for more extensive bearing calculation.
For calculation of the rating life Lh in operating hours or oscillations 
taking account of the operating data applicable to the application, 
the rating life calculation method is available for almost all products, 
see page 47.
Maintenance-free

Guide values for Cr/P or Ca/P are used in conjunction with

Load carrying capacity and life
Basic load ratings
Basic load ratings are key data specific to the plain bearings that are 
not standardised and may differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. 
They are derived from the material-specific load parameters K and 
the projected load-bearing area of the bearing in each case.
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating Cr or Ca is used in cases of
dynamic loading. A plain bearing is subjected to dynamic loading
if it performs rotary, swivel, tilt or linear motion under load.
The basic dynamic load rating is the maximum permissible dynamic 
load. In the case of radial spherical plain bearings, it can be utilised 
to the full only if the load acts purely in a radial direction. In the case 
of axial spherical plain bearings, it can be utilised to the full only
if the load acts purely in a concentric, axial direction.
If the basic dynamic load rating is utilised to the full, there is often
a considerable reduction in the operating life of the bearings.
The degree to which the basic load rating is utilised should therefore 
always be matched to the required operating life. The basic load 
rating depends on the sliding contact surface and influences
the rating life of the plain bearings.
Basic static load rating
The basic static load rating C0r or C0a is used if a plain bearing is 
subjected to load while stationary.
It indicates the load that the plain bearing can support at room 
temperature without damage to the bearing. This is subject to
the precondition that the components adjacent to the bearing must 
prevent deformation of the bearing.
If the basic load rating C0r or C0a is utilised to the full, the shaft and 
housing must be made from high strength materials.

The bearing load describes the external forces acting on the bearing.
Concentric constant force F
For calculation of the static load safety factor, the specific load and 
the rating life, load values can be taken directly into consideration 
under the following preconditions, Figure 1 and Figure 2: 
■Loads act in a radial direction only on radial spherical plain 
bearings, angular contact spherical plain bearings and cylindrical 
plain bushes.
■Loads act in an axial direction only on axial spherical plain 
bearings.
■Loads do not vary in their magnitude and direction during 
operation.

If the concentric force varies in magnitude during motion, rating life

alternating loads is taken into consideration by means of the correc-
tion factor fHz, see page 66.

Load carrying capacity and life
Combined loading
by radial and axial forces
If spherical plain bearings are subjected simultaneously to radial 
and axial loads, combined loading is present. The equivalent static 
bearing load is calculated on a similar basis to the equivalent 
dynamic bearing load. The permissible ranges for the ratio Fa/Fr are 
valid for static and for dynamic loading.
In the case of dynamic loading, the equivalent dynamic bearing
load P must be used in rating life calculation. This values takes
the combined forces into consideration in rating life calculation.
In the case of static loading, the equivalent static bearing load P0 
must be used in calculation of the static load safety factor. This
value takes the combined forces into consideration in calculation
of the static load safety factor.

The correct spherical plain bearing is selected as follows:
■The permissible range for the ratio Fa/Fr in the case of radial 
spherical plain bearings is between 0 and 0,3.
■If the ratio Fa/Fr exceeds the value 0,3, angular contact spherical 
plain bearings can be used. Their ratio Fa/Fr extends to a value
of 3, since they can support higher axial forces.
■If the axial forces are more than twice the radial forces,
axial spherical plain bearings can be used.

in the bearing in the dynamic state. It is the decisive criterion
for assessing the suitability of a plain bearing in the particular 
application.
The specific bearing load occurring in a bearing is dependent
on the load, the sliding contact surface, the lubrication conditions 
and the mounting situation. Due to the influence of these factors, 
precise calculation is not possible.
If the required operating life is to be achieved, the specific bearing 
load must be matched to the actual operating conditions.
Under extreme loading conditions, such as high axial load in the 
case of radial spherical plain bearings, elastic deformation of the 
bearing and housing may lead to contact pressure concentrations. 
Please contact Schaeffler in this case.

Alternative calculation method
for bushes and thrust washers
Due to the simple geometry of plain bushes EGB, ZWB and ZGB as 
well as flanged bushes EGF and thrust washers EGW, their specific 
bearing load can alternatively be determined by means of the follow-
ing relationships. It is assumed in this case that there is uniform load

Bearing motion
The bearing motion describes the dynamic conditions in the bearing. 
These are essentially indicated by the swivel angle and tilt angle,
the velocity of motion and the frequency of motion.

diameter.

Frequency of motion
The number of motions per time period, the frequency, has a signifi-
cant influence on the operating life of spherical plain bearings.
In addition to the load, the coefficient of friction and the motion 
parameter, the frequency influences the frictional energy generated 
in the bearing. This is dependent on the relevant sliding contact 
surface and must not exceed the permissible pv values, see table, 
page 50.
The frequency can only be used for calculating the sliding velocity
in applications with continuous operation or periodic stationary 
periods.

Swivel angle
Swivel motion is defined as relative motion with reversing direction 
about the bearing axis. In the case of spherical plain bearings,
the two bearing rings move relative to each other, in the case of 
bushes the shaft and bush move relative to each other.
The centring angle described by the two return points is described
as the swivel angle , Figure 8. This describes the motion between 
the two extreme points.
Tilt angle
In tilt motion of spherical plain bearings, the inner ring and shaft 
locating washer move relative to the outer ring and housing locating 
washer in a direction transverse to the bearing axis. The axes of
the relevant bearing rings intersect below the tilt angle , Figure 9.
The maximum permissible tilt angle  must be observed,
see dimension tables. Full utilisation of the basic load ratings is
only permissible within the stated tilt angle .

Rating life
Calculation of the theoretical rating life is based on a large number 
of laboratory tests and takes account of certain operational data.
The rating life is defined as the number of motion cycles or operating 
hours that can be achieved by the majority of a sufficiently large 
number of plain bearings under identical operating conditions 
before certain failure criteria are met.
The amount of wear and increase in friction are dependent
on the sliding contact surface and the application. Under identical 
operating conditions, the operating life achieved may therefore 
differ significantly.
The calculation of the theoretical rating life gives comparative values 
for the bearings. It gives information about the higher or lower 
performance of the selected bearings.
Failure criteria
In plain bearings, wear occurs as a result of solid body and mixed 
friction conditions. The failure criteria are test limit values that are 
related to a quantity of wear as a function of the bearing size or
an upper coefficient of friction that is exceeded, see tables.
Operating clearance
as a failure criterion
1) In the case of axial and angular contact spherical plain bearings with the 
sliding layer ELGOGLIDE®, the increase in the operating clearance, irrespective
of the operating clearance, is 0,5 mm.

Load carrying capacity and life
Influences on the rating life
Calculation of the basic rating life applies to plain bearings that 
perform rotary, swivel or linear motion.
The significant factors for a long rating life are the pv value and
the design of the mating surface. In the case of metal/polymer com-
posite plain bearings as well as ELGOGLIDE® and ELGOTEX® bushes, 
particular attention must be paid to the material, roughness depth 
and surface structure of the mating surface. In the case of spherical 
plain bearings, an optimum mating surface is provided by the inner 
ring.
The ambient temperature, heat dissipation via the shaft, bearing and 
housing as well as the operating duration have a fundamental 
influence on the operating temperature and thus on the rating life.
Extraordinary factors
The following parameters are not taken into consideration in rating 
life calculation and may in certain circumstances have a very 
considerable influence on the operating life:
■corrosion
■ageing of the lubricant
■contamination
■humidity
■vibrations
■shocks.
Operating life
The operating life is the life actually achieved by a plain bearing.
It may deviate from the calculated rating life.

Basic rating life
Due to the large number of influences, the calculated basic rating life 
is a guide value. In the case of plain bearings, the values may there-
fore be excessively high at very low bearing loads or very low sliding 
velocities.
If the sliding layer E50 is used in linear motion, advice should be 
sought from the Schaeffler engineering service.
Theoretical rating life calculations are only valid for the products 
presented in this catalogue when used in accordance with the 
validity range (load, sliding velocity and operating temperature) and 
with the recommendations described, see tables, page 50, and 
section Design of bearing arrangements, page 90. Theoretical rating 
life calculations can under no circumstances be transferred to other 
products.
The rating life calculation is not valid for large radial spherical plain 
bearings GE..-DW, axial spherical plain bearings GE..-AX and 
strips EGS. For a rating life estimate in the case of these series,
the Schaeffler engineering service should be contacted.
In the case of thrust washers EGW, the rating life calculation is
only valid if the bearing runs free from clearance at all times and
the mating surface is at least as large as the thrust washer.
Dry friction, mixed friction and
hydrodynamics
The preconditions for rating life calculation are as follows:
■Maintenance-free plain bearings must undergo dry running.
■Mixed friction must be present in plain bearings that require 
maintenance or are low-maintenance.
■Where hydrodynamic conditions are applied, the Schaeffler 
engineering service should be contacted.

Calculation
of the basic rating life
The basic rating life is calculated using the following equations and 
is dependent on the specific plain bearing factor and any correction 
factors necessary, see page 52 and tables, page 55.
The procedure for rating life calculation is shown in a diagram, 
Figure 11. Ordering examples are given in the corresponding product 
descriptions.
Before calculation of the rating life, it is absolutely essential
to check the permissible loads, sliding velocities and temperatures, 
see tables, page 50.
For flanged bushes, the rating life must be checked for both
the radial sliding surface and the axial sliding surface (flange).

Friction and increases in temperature
Friction and wear
Friction describe the force that acts in opposition to motion.
The key value stated is the coefficient of friction .
Friction is essentially dependent on the following influencing 
factors:
■the sliding contact surface
■the load
■the sliding velocity
■the bearing temperature
■the lubrication condition
■the quality of the sliding surfaces.
Fundamental curve
of the coefficient of friction
For maintenance-free plain bearings based on PTFE, the fundamental 
curve of the coefficient of friction  is shown as a function
of sliding velocity, load and temperature, Figure 1. The coefficient
of friction decreases with an increasing specific bearing load p
and a decreasing sliding velocity v.
 = coefficient of friction
v = sliding velocity

Friction and wear curve
The wear curve for maintenance-free plain bearings is divided into 
the running-in phase, main wear phase and failure phase, Figure 2. 
The main wear phase is approximately linear in character.
The friction curve of maintenance-free plain bearings shows
a characteristic pattern in the three phases, Figure 2.
Bearing frictional torque
The bearing frictional torque M is valid under radial load in the case 
of radial and angular contact spherical plain bearings. In the case
of axial spherical plain bearings and thrust washers, it is valid under 
axial load.
In the case of new plain bearings, the bearing frictional torque may 
be significantly higher during the early running-in phase. This is
for the following reasons:
■Plastic transfer of the PTFE material occurs to the surface 
structure of the mating surface.
■The internal tribology of the bearing is not yet complete and
PTFE particles are deposited on the mating surface and functional 
surface (PTFE/PTFE friction).
If spherical plain bearings are subjected to combined radial and 
axial load, the bearing frictional torque is determined by integration 
of the normal forces. In the case of flanged bushes, the frictional 
torque must be calculated for both the radial sliding surface and
the axial sliding surface on the flange.

For reasons of safety, the maximum coefficient of friction must

this may lead to increased wear, a rise in bearing temperature and 
impaired functioning of the plain bearing.

1) For E40, detailed coefficients of friction must be observed,

Heat dissipation
Friction is converted into heat. Adequate heat dissipation is essen-
tial for the function of a plain bearing. This occurs through convec-
tion via the housings and shafts to the environment. In some cases, 
heat is carried away by means of the lubricant.
In plain bearings where high frictional energy pv is converted, 
increased heat dissipation is required.

Internal clearance and operating clearance
Operating clearance
of spherical plain bearings
The operating clearance or preload is determined on a fitted bearing 
still warm from operation.
It is derived from the radial internal clearance and the change
in the radial internal clearance as a result of interference fit and 
thermal influences in the fitted condition.
Internal clearance of radial
spherical plain bearings
The radial and axial internal clearance is determined on
the dismounted bearing.
The radial internal clearance of radial spherical plain bearings is 
defined as the distance by which the inner ring can be moved in
a radial direction relative to the outer ring from one extreme position 
to the precisely opposite extreme position, Figure 1.
Maintenance-free
spherical plain bearings
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings have a very small internal 
clearance, see dimension tables. As a result, preloads may be 
present once the bearing is fitted.
Spherical plain bearings
requiring maintenance
The radial internal clearance is subdivided into three groups
in accordance with DIN ISO 12240-1, see table. The precondition is
a housing bore that causes no dimensional changes in the bearing 
with the exception of geometrical inaccuracies.
Radial internal clearance groups
1) Relubrication only possible with tilt angle  = 0°.
2) Example of bearing with restricted internal clearance: GE220-DO-2RS-C2.

It is dependent on the bearing geometry and is in a direct relation-

Theoretical bearing clearance
of metal/polymer composite
plain bushes
Bushes with the sliding layer E40 and E50 are pressed into
the housing. This provides axial and radial location. No additional 
means of location are required.
If the recommended mounting tolerances are used with rigid hous-
ings and shafts, this gives an interference fit or bearing clearance, 
see table, page 102.
Expansion of the housing bore is not taken into account in calcu-
lation of the bearing clearance.
Calculation of the interference U is carried out using the tolerances 
of the housing bore and the deviations for the bush outside 
diameter Do, see table, page 102, and table, page 303, or
table, page 352.
Calculation of bearing clearance
The theoretical bearing clearance is calculated as follows:

The bushes are pressed as standard into a housing with the 
tolerance H7. This provides radial and axial location.
Due to the contraction of the inside diameter, there is a change in
the tolerance of the inside diameter of the bush after pressing in,
see table, page 88.
Expansion of the housing bore is not taken into consideration
in calculation of the bearing clearance.
Depending on the selected shaft fit, there is a theoretical bearing

Operating clearance
of ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes
Due to the self-lubricating PTFE fabric, maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® 
plain bushes do not require a minimum radial clearance determined 
by lubrication conditions.
Fitting without clearance has particular advantages, especially
with alternating load directions. Load distribution is also improved, 
especially during running-in, due to the larger load-bearing areas.
In order to achieve the largest possible load-bearing angle, the oper-
ating clearance s must not exceed defined limits. The clearance can 
be expressed as a function of the relative bearing clearance ,
see equation and Figure 7.
The guide values for the relative bearing clearance are valid for shaft 
diameters d = 30 mm to 200 mm, see table.
The ranges for the operating clearance are achievable with
the standard tolerances of the plain bushes and where the housing 
bore and shaft are manufactured to the central tolerance.

Design of bearing arrangements
Adjacent construction

The chamfers, radii, edge breaks and surface quality required
for the shaft and housing bore are defined as follows.
Chamfers, radii and
chamfer dimensions
Spherical plain bearings have a convex transition between
the outside surface and the bore to the end faces. This gives easier 
mounting.
The bearing rings must be in contact with the shaft and housing 
shoulders. The largest radius of the shaft and housing locating face 
must therefore not be larger than the smallest chamfer dimension 
r1, r2 of the bearing, Figure 1 and dimension tables.
In the case of spherical plain bearings, the shaft and housing bore
of the adjacent construction should have a lead chamfer of between 
10° and 20°, Figure 2. Any burrs must be removed.

Surface of the shaft and
housing bore
The seating surfaces for the bearings must be designed such that
the forces introduced via the bearings do not cause impermissible 
changes to the geometry of the shaft and housing and do not cause 
permanent deformations of the spherical plain bearing.
Where spherical plain bearings are subjected to high loads
of p  80 N/mm2, the shaft and housing must be checked.
If it is possible that a preload and an associated frictional torque
in the bearing is present, this must be taken into consideration in
the design of the bearing arrangement. The accuracy of the adjacent 
construction must therefore be checked with Schaeffler.

Design of bearing arrangements
Adjacent construction
of plain bushes
In the design of the adjacent construction of plain bushes,
a distinction is made in relation to the bearing type. The guidelines 
on ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes and ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes 
are similar and have been combined.
ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes and
ELGOTEX® filament
wound bushes
The shaft and housing bore should be produced as specified, 
Figure 4. For the shaft, a roughness Rz 1 is recommended.
A higher roughness will reduce the operating life of plain bushes.
A roughness higher than Rz 4 must be avoided.
ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes
For optimum conditions, the shaft should be hardened and have
a hard chromium coating or should be made from corrosion-resistant 
steel. For increased loads, the hardness of the steel should
be at least 55 HRC. Lower hardness values may lead to a reduced 
rating life.
ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes
For optimum conditions, the shaft should be hardened.
For increased loads, the hardness of the steel should be at least 
55 HRC. Lower hardness values may lead to a reduced rating life.
If the full volume of the sliding layer is to be used, the raceway
on the shaft must be hard, smooth and resistant to corrosion.

Shafts should be chamfered and all sharp edges rounded,
see page 299. For easier pressing in, the chamfer should be 
produced to fG  20° 5°, see table and Figure 5.
The recommended mounting tolerances for the shaft and housing 
bore must be observed, see table, page 102.
For the housing bore, a roughness depth of Rz10 is recommended. 
The optimum operating life in dry running of the sliding layer E40
is achieved with a shaft roughness depth of Rz2 to Rz3.
Very small roughness depths will not increase the operating life,
but larger roughness depths will lead to a significant reduction.

Axial location
of spherical plain bearings
Spherical plain bearings under high loads undergo elastic defor-
mation. This leads to relative micromovements in the fits. As a result, 
the bearing rings can creep in an axial direction despite a tight fit.
In order to prevent axial displacement, the bearing rings must always 
be located axially.
Retaining ring or spacer ring
Suitable means of locating the bearing rings are as follows, Figure 7 
and Figure 8:
■retaining rings. These allow easy mounting and dismounting
of the bearings.
■spacer rings between the bearing ring and adjacent component
if weakening of the shaft by annular slots is unacceptable or
the bearings are to be preloaded.
Preload prevents rotary motion between the bearing ring and 
adjacent construction, even with a loose fit.

Location
of thrust washers and strips
Concentric seating of thrust washers is ensured by means of 
recesses in the housing, Figure 11. Diameters and depths of 
recesses, see dimension tables.
Undesirable rotation of the thrust washers must be prevented by 
means of a dowel pin or countersunk head screw. The screw head or 
dowel pin must be recessed relative to the running surface by at least 
0,25 mm, Figure 11 and Figure 12. Size and arrangement of the 
holes, see dimension tables.
If it is not possible to make a recess in the housing, the plain 
bearings must be secured by means of several dowel pins or screws. 
It is also possible to use other cost-effective joining techniques such 
as laser welding, soft soldering or adhesive bonding, see page 367.
It is not always necessary to provide security against rotation.
In some cases, the adhesive friction between the backing of the bush 
and the housing will be sufficient.
Strips can be located in the same way as thrust washers.

Design of bearing arrangements
Recommended
mounting tolerances
for spherical plain bearings
Spherical plain bearings are radially located by means of fits.
The recommended values for shaft and housing fits are dependent 
on the adjacent construction, see tables.
Application
as locating bearings
Tight fits prevent damage to the adjacent construction. The shaft and 
bore fits must therefore be selected such that no sliding motion 
occurs on the shaft or in the housing bore.
When using tight fits, the following must be noted:
■Interference between the housing and outer ring causes 
contraction of the outer ring.
■Interference between the shaft and bearing bore causes 
expansion of the inner ring.
These elastic deformations of the bearing rings reduce the internal 
clearance of the spherical plain bearing, see section Internal clear-
ance and operating clearance, page 72. If a tight fit is not possible, 
the bearing rings must be secured against axial sliding motion
on the shaft or in the housing, see page 97.
Application
as non-locating bearings
The axial displacement should occur between the shaft and bearing 
bore:
■The length/diameter ratio of the guidance is more favourable
at this point than on the outer ring of the bearing.
■The axially split outer ring expands under axial load and
can therefore jam in the bearing location.
■No wear should occur in the housing bore.
The surface of the shaft must be produced so that it is resistant
to wear. The surface hardness must be  55 HRC.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings can have a lining
of ELGOGLIDE® in the bearing bore, suffix W7 or W8, see table, 
page 145.
When used as non-locating bearings, spherical plain bearings 
requiring maintenance should only be lubricated via the shaft.
In the case of a non-locating bearing arrangement, the shaft fit g6
is recommended.

---

Schaeffler Technologies
HG 1
101
Maintenance-free
spherical plain bearings
In comparison with spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance, 
looser fits may be used with maintenance-free bearings. The bearing 
friction is lower in this case due to the hard chromium/PTFE sliding 
contact surface.
Tighter fits may be necessary for applications with pulsating or 
alternating loads or where circumferential loads are present.
Since maintenance-free spherical plain bearings have only a very 
small internal clearance, preload may occur in the bearing once
in the fitted condition.
Shaft and housing fits
for maintenance-free
spherical plain bearings
1) GE..-PW: for shaft m6.
2) In the case of alternating load, M7/m6 is recommended.
Spherical plain bearings
requiring maintenance
The operating life of spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance 
is reduced by preloading of the sliding surfaces and excessively 
small load-bearing areas of the sliding surfaces as a result of an 
impermissibly high internal clearance. The recommended values for 
shaft and housing fits are dependent on the adjacent construction, 
see table.
If tighter fits are necessary, for example where high, impact type 
loads occur, the operating clearance must be checked by means
of calculation, see chapter page 72.
If it is possible that a preload and an associated frictional torque
in the bearing is present, this must be taken into consideration in
the design of the bearing arrangement. The accuracy of the adjacent 
construction must therefore be checked with Schaeffler.

Misalignment of plain bushes
Precise alignment is important for plain bushes. This is particularly 
valid for maintenance-free plain bushes, in which load cannot be 
distributed by means of a lubricant film.
The misalignment across the entire bush width should be 

 0,02 mm, Figure 13. This also applies across the entire width
of bushes arranged in pairs as well as to thrust washers.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving spatial 
motion. Any skewing of the shaft will reduce the operating life.
Edge loading
of metal/polymer composite
plain bushes
In the case of metal/polymer composite plain bushes, the high edge 
loads should be reduced by means of chamfers, larger bore 
diameters in the vicinity of the edge or wide bushes that protrude 
beyond the edge of the bore, Figure 14.
Where bushes are arranged in series, they should be of the same 
width and the butt joints should be in alignment.

Combination of axial and radial
spherical plain bearings
If axial spherical plain bearings are combined with radial spherical 
plain bearings of dimension series E to DIN ISO 12240-1  in order to 
support radial forces, the axial and radial load must be distributed 
over both bearings. The pin in the shaft locating washer must have
a radial release of approx. 1 mm or the pin must only be in contact 
with the large end face of the shaft locating washer, Figure 17.
For a bore diameter of d  160 mm or larger in the case of 
maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings, the bearing must 
be fitted in a closed housing. The diameter D of the axial bearing 
corresponds to the inside diameter of the housing.

Sealing
Functions
The sealing arrangement has a considerable influence on the oper-
ating life of a bearing arrangement. It is intended to retain the lubri-
cant in the bearing and prevent the ingress of contaminants into
the bearing.
In the selection of seals, attention must be paid to:
■the operating and environmental conditions
■the degree of radial mobility of the bearing
■the tilt angle of the bearing
■the design envelope
■the costs and work required.
For expanded temperature ranges, sealing must be agreed in consul-
tation with Schaeffler.

Seals in the bearing
Various possibilities are available for the sealing of bearings.
These should be selected as a function of the application.
Seal 2RS
Where higher requirements for sealing action are present, lip seals 
made from thermoplastic polyurethane TPU are used. The seal lips 
are radially preloaded against the bearing, Figure 1.
Seals 2RS for maintenance-free spherical plain bearings and 
spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance are designed for 
indoor applications and are suitable for operating temperatures
from –30 °C to +130 °C.
Seal 2TS
Where very high requirements for sealing action are present, triple 
lip seals made from NBR with steel supporting elements are used, 
Figure 2. They give excellent protection of the bearing against water, 
dust and contamination and are suitable for indoor and outdoor 
applications.
Seals 2TS for maintenance-free spherical plain bearings and 
spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance are suitable for oper-
ating temperatures from –30 °C to +100 °C. For short periods,
temperatures up to a maximum of +130 °C are permissible. Seals for 
expanded temperature ranges are available by agreement.

Sealing
Seals
in the adjacent construction
Open and sealed plain bearings can be additionally sealed by means 
of external seals.
Grease collar
The grease collar is a simple and effective type of seal, Figure 6.
By means of frequent relubrication, a grease collar is formed on
the end faces of the spherical plain bearing that protects the bearing 
against contaminants.
The grease collar is suitable for spherical plain bearings requiring 
lubrication and has proved particularly effective, in conjunction with 
daily maintenance, in aggressive operating conditions.
The temperature range is dependent on the grease selection.
For suitable lubricants, see page 180.
External seal
Simple but highly effective sealing can be achieved by means
of sealing rings made from thermoplastic polyurethane TPU. This is 
specially developed for radial spherical plain bearings in accordance 
with DIN ISO 12240-1, dimension series E and can be integrated
in the adjacent construction as an external seal, Figure 7.
Particularly low seal friction is achieved if the sealing rings for 
spherical plain bearings are worked in oil or flowable grease before 
fitting. In the case of maintenance-free spherical plain bearings, 
please consult Schaeffler.
External seals are suitable for operating temperatures from –30 °C
to +130 °C.

V-ring,
single lip design
The V-ring, Figure 8 is a lip seal with axial sealing action. During 
fitting, this single piece rubber ring is pushed under tension along 
the shaft until its lip is in axial contact with the housing wall. The seal 
lip acts simultaneously as a flinger shield.
The single lip V-ring is suitable for relatively large tilt motions and
for operating temperatures from –40 °C to +100 °C. 
It is particularly easy to fit and is resistant to grease, oil and ageing.
V-shaped sealing ring,
double lip design
The V-shaped sealing ring is a simple seal with lip seals on both 
sides. The inside diameter of the sealing ring is in contact with
the spherical surface of the inner ring, Figure 9.
V-shaped sealing rings are suitable for operating temperatures
from –40 °C to +100 °C.

Sealing
Two component seal
The two component seal is a seal lip made from a nitrile mixture 
modified with PTFE and is preloaded by means of a high-grade
steel coil spring. The seal shoulder is made from a nitrile mixture 
reinforced with cotton, Figure 10.
The bearing is sealed on the protruding part of the inner ring 
spherical surface.
The two component seal is easy to use and is suitable for operating 
temperatures from –40 °C to +120 °C, with operation for short 
periods at up to +150 °C.
Rotary shaft seal
The rotary shaft seal is a steel-reinforced plastic ring with a seal lip. 
The seal collar with one lip is pressed against the shaft running 
surface by a coil spring, Figure 11.
Rotary shaft seals are suitable for small tilt angles with grease and
oil lubrication. They prevent the egress of lubricant. A sealing ring 
with an additional protective lip also prevents the ingress of 
contamination.
The temperature range is dependent on the seal material.
If grease lubrication is used:
■the seal lip should be positioned facing outwards.
If oil bath lubrication is used:
■the seal lip should be positioned facing inwards
■an additional dust lip facing outwards should be used.

Seals for plain bushes
Possibilities for sealing the bearing position in the adjacent 
construction are as follows, Figure 12:
■a modified adjacent construction
■gap seals
■rotary shaft seals.
The suitability of the sealing arrangement must be agreed
in consultation with the seal manufacturer.
If the seal is designed with additional outer seals, it must be borne 
in mind that the bearing clearance will increase due to the wear
of the sliding layer. Plain bushes with ELGOGLIDE®, ELGOTEX® or E40 
are not lubricated. Grease must be prevented from leaving a seal and 
coming into contact with these sliding layers.

Mounting and dismounting
General guidelines
In the interests of the user, the applicable legal regulations and other 
directives relating to environmental protection and occupational 
safety must be observed.
Plain bearings must be handled with care before and during mount-
ing. Problem-free functioning of the sliding surfaces is substantially 
dependent on the care taken in mounting. The sliding surfaces must 
not be damaged. It must be ensured that mounting is carried out
in clean conditions.
The bearings will only achieve their maximum operating life and 
functional capability if they are mounted correctly. Where a mount-
ing position is specified, this must be observed in all cases.
Further information
■Schaeffler offers products and services for the mounting and 
dismounting of plain bearings, see section Mounting and 
maintenance, page 401.
Delivered condition
The plain bearings are supplied with preservative in a box, or in a bag 
held in a box or in a crate. Depending on their design, rod ends are 
supplied protected by a preservative or with a zinc coating.
Any change, irrespective of the bearing type, will reduce their 
operating life.
Bearings must not be treated or cleaned using trichloroethylene, 
perchloroethylene, petroleum spirit or other solvents.
Substances containing oil will change the characteristics
of the bearings.
Storage of bearings
Plain bearings should be stored:
■in the original packaging
■in clean, dry areas
■at as constant a temperature as possible
■at a relative humidity of max. 65%.
Unpacking of bearings
Plain bearings should only be removed from their packaging 
immediately before mounting:
■Hands should be kept clean and dry and protective gloves worn
if necessary (perspiration leads to corrosion).
■If the original packaging is damaged, the products must be 
checked.
■If the products are contaminated, they must be wiped
with a clean cloth only.

Guidelines for mounting
The guidelines for mounting must be followed precisely and
the operating specifications must be observed:
■If not, there is a direct or indirect hazard to personnel, the product 
or the adjacent construction.
■The bearings must be protected against moisture and aggressive 
media.
■The bearings must always be located concentrically.
■Mounting may only be carried out by qualified personnel. If errors 
are made in mounting, no claims may be made under warranty. 
Schaeffler assumes no liability for damage caused by defective 
mounting, incorrect maintenance, incorrect communication
of the content of this chapter to third parties or a failure to 
communicate the content.
Maintenance-free
plain bearings
Plain bearings with maintenance-free sliding layers must not be 
lubricated. The use of lubricant will lead to a considerable reduction 
in the operating life.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings and maintenance-free 
plain bushes should be mounted such that no lubricant or other 
substances used to aid mounting can reach the sliding surfaces.
Transport
of large radial spherical
plain bearings
Large spherical plain bearings must only be transported using
the eye bolts supplied. For this purpose, the radial bearings have 
threaded holes on the end faces of the inner and outer rings, 
Figure 1.
Orientation for mounting
of large radial spherical
plain bearings
For the mounting of large radial spherical plain bearings GE..-DW
and GE..-DW-2RS2, it must be ensured that the screw connection
on one side of the outer ring halves is facing towards the open side 
of the bearing. This makes subsequent dismounting easier.

Mounting and dismounting
Checking
the adjacent construction
Before mounting of spherical plain bearings, rod ends and plain 
bushes, the adjacent construction must be checked as follows:
■the quality of the bearing seating surface on the shaft and 
housing bore
■the dimensional and geometrical accuracy of seating and 
locating faces
■the shaft and housing seats
■any chamfers, radii and edge breaks required on the shaft and 
housing bore, see section Design of bearing arrangements, 
page 90.
Any burrs present must be removed.
If tight fits are present or mounting conditions present difficulties, 
the surface of the shaft and housing bore should be lightly oiled.
If welding work is carried out on the adjacent construction, welding 
currents must not be allowed to pass through the spherical plain 
bearing, since this will immediately damage the sliding surfaces.
Positioning of the joint
In radial spherical plain bearings with outer rings split at one and
two points, the joints must be positioned at 90° to the main load 
direction, Figure 2.
The lubrication holes in bearings requiring maintenance are thus 
positioned directly in the load zone. This allows good lubricant 
distribution in the load zone area.
Adhesive bonding
of bearing rings
If the recommended fits are observed, adhesive bonding of
the bearing rings is not generally necessary.
Adhesives may only be used on spherical plain bearings with 
steel/steel sliding contact surfaces under the following conditions:
■The surfaces to be bonded must be clean and free from grease.
■The raceways must be cleaned using a cleaning agent and well 
lubricated using a paste with a high MoS2 content.
■It must be ensured that the lubricant ducts and lubricant holes 
are not blocked by adhesive.

Pressing in
of spherical plain bearings
Always apply mounting forces to the bearing ring to be mounted, 
Figure 3. If these forces are directed through the sliding surfaces, 
this could lead to jamming of the bearings during mounting.
When mounting the bearings on a shaft and in a housing, the mount-
ing tools used must act simultaneously on the end faces of the inner 
and outer ring, Figure 3.
Larger bearings must be mounted using special mounting equip-
ment, Figure 4. As the bearing diameter increases, so do
the mounting forces required and simple impact type tools are
no longer adequate in these cases.
Further information on the mounting and maintenance of plain 
bearings is available from the industrial service function
of Schaeffler, see section Mounting and maintenance, page 401.
Avoid direct blows with a hammer and drift on the end faces of
the bearing rings, since this can lead to microcracks in the bearing.
Hydraulic assistance
For special spherical plain bearings with a conical bore, hydraulic 
nuts are used in conjunction with hydraulic pumps, see page 412.

Pressing in of bushes
The bushes can be easily pressed into the housing bore. The bushes 
can be pressed in more easily if the bush backing or housing bore is 
lightly oiled.
Bushes can be pressed in flush or into a counterbore using a press-
in mandrel, Figure 5 and Figure 6. In the case of metal/polymer 
composite plain bushes, an auxiliary ring should additionally be 
used due to the butt joint for a diameter equal to or greater than 
 55 mm, Figure 7, page 121.
The chamfer on the mandrel must have rounded transitions or 
rounding of the end.
Sharp transitions on the entry side of the shaft and mandrel will 
damage the sliding layer during mounting and reduce the operating 
life of the plain bearings.

Mounting and dismounting
Thermal assistance
In order to reduce the mounting forces, spherical plain bearings can 
be heated.
Do not heat bearings to more than +130 °C, since higher tempera-
tures will damage the seals in sealed bearings.
Spherical plain bearings must not be heated in an oil bath:
■In the case of maintenance-free spherical plain bearings,
this affects the tribological system.
■In the case of spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance 
with a steel/steel sliding contact surface, this will change
the concentration of molybdenum disulphide on the sliding 
surfaces.
Bearings must not be heated using a naked flame:
■The material undergoes excessive localised heating,
reducing its hardness.
■Furthermore, stresses are induced in the bearing.
■The seals could melt.
■Maintenance-free sliding layers could be damaged.
Mounting
by means of refrigeration
The structure of the rings of radial spherical plain bearings with
a steel/steel sliding contact surface will change at temperatures 
below –61 °C. Due to the structural change, their volume may 
increase; the change to the tolerances may lead to jamming of
the bearing.
If this mounting method is to be used, the bearing rings can be 
supplied with appropriate heat treatment. Please consult the 
Schaeffler engineering service.
For easier fitting, maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes can be 
cooled for a short time in liquid nitrogen at –196 °C.
In the case of plain bushes with integrated  seals 2RS, the correct 
seating of the seals in the undercut must be checked after 
refrigeration.

Tools for
thermally assisted mounting
Heating can be carried out using heating cabinets with a controllable 
thermostat, induction heating devices, Figure 8, or medium 
frequency technology. The advantages include uniform heating,
no contamination of components and the absence of long pre-
heating times.
Further information is available from the industrial service function 
of Schaeffler, see page 409.
Localised heating must be avoided. The bearing temperature must 
be monitored using a thermometer.
Information in the catalogue and manufacturer's data on grease and 
seals must be observed.

Dismounting
of spherical plain bearings
Even if the force is applied to the ring to be dismounted in accord-
ance with the specification in the case of spherical plain bearings, 
the frictional contact of the other ring due to the fit presents 
difficulties in dismounting.
Depending on the joint pressure, contraction of the inner ring and 
expansion of the outer ring will occur, Figure 9. The extraction forces 
also increase with increasing joint pressure.

ELGES spherical plain bearings
Spherical plain bearings,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 134
Spherical plain bearings are ready-to-fit, standardised machine 
elements. Due to the outer ring with its concave inner slideway and 
the inner ring with its crowned outer slideway, they can perform 
spatial adjustment motions.
The bearings are available as radial and axial spherical plain bear-
ings. They can support static loads, are suitable for tilt and swivel 
motion, compensate for shaft misalignment, are not subject to edge 
stresses under misalignment and allow substantial manufacturing 
tolerances in the adjacent construction.
These spherical plain bearings are completely maintenance-free. 
They are used where particular requirements for operating life
apply in conjunction with maintenance-free operation or where,
for reasons of lubrication, bearings with metallic sliding contact 
surfaces are not suitable, for example under unilateral load.
The standard sliding layer used is ELGOGLIDE®.
Spherical plain bearings,
requiring maintenance
................................................................................................................. 170
These bearings correspond in their construction to the maintenance-
free designs but are lubricated via the outer and inner ring.
They transmit movements and forces with low moment levels, thus 
keeping bending stresses away from the construction elements and 
are particularly suitable for alternating loads with impact and shock 
type stresses.
The sliding contact surface is the metallic combination steel/steel or 
steel/bronze.

Spherical plain bearings,  

maintenance-free
Features
Spherical plain bearings allow spatial adjustment movements and, 
depending on the bearing type, can support radial, combined or 
axial loads.
Radial
spherical plain bearings
Maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings comprise inner 
rings, outer rings and maintenance-free sliding layers. The inner 
rings have a cylindrical bore with a curved outer slideway.
The outer rings have a cylindrical outside surface and a concave 
inner slideway.
Between the inner and outer ring is an ELGOGLIDE® sliding surface. 
The sliding surface in the series GE..-UK and GE..-FW is PTFE 
composite, while the sliding surface in series GE..-PW is PTFE film.
For a description of the sliding surfaces, see page 140.
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs.
Area of application
Radial spherical plain bearings are preferably used to support
radial forces. GE..-UK-2RS(-2TS), GE..-FW-2RS(-2TS), GE..-DW and
GE..-DW-2RS2 are also suitable for alternating loads up to a contact 
pressure of p = 150 N/mm2. The bearings are used where particular 
requirements for operating life apply in conjunction with 
maintenance-free operation or where, for reasons of lubrication, 
bearings with metallic sliding contact surfaces are not suitable,
for example under unilateral load.
Large radial
spherical plain bearings
Large radial spherical plain bearings GE..-DW and GE..-DW-2RS2
of d  320 mm are X-life bearings and are indicated as such
in the dimension tables.
These bearings have even higher performance materials, lower 
coefficients of friction and lower running-in wear than comparable 
bearings.
Split outer ring
In series GE..-UK-2RS(-2TS) up to a diameter d 
 140 mm, the outer 
ring is axially split at one point, while for diameters d  160 mm
it is axially split at two points and held together by means of heavy-
section retaining washers.
In the case of bearings GE..-FW-2RS(-2TS) up to a diameter 
d 
 120 mm, the outer ring is axially split at one point, while for 
diameters d  140 mm it is axially split at two points and held 
together by means of heavy-section retaining washers. In the case
of GE..-DW and GE..-DW-2RS2, the outer ring is radially split. It is held 
together by means of screws and dowel pins.
Extended inner rings
GE..-FW-2RS(-2TS) and GE..-FW have extended inner rings.
As a result, larger tilt angles are possible.

Series, sliding layer, standard
Radial spherical plain bearings are designed according to their 
specific series with different sliding layers, see table and section 
Sliding layers, page 140.
Series and design
Angular contact
spherical plain bearings
Angular contact spherical plain bearings GE..-SW correspond to 
DIN ISO 12240-2. They have inner rings with a curved outer slideway 
and outer rings with a concave inner slideway to which the sliding 
layer ELGOGLIDE® is attached by adhesive.
The bearings are available for shaft diameters from 25 mm
to 200 mm. Other sizes are available by agreement.
Area of application
The bearings can support radial and axial loads and are suitable for 
alternating dynamic loads. They can be used in paired arrangements 
as preloaded units.
Angular contact spherical plain bearings are used to support high 
loads occurring in conjunction with small motions. They are a good 
plain bearing alternative to tapered roller bearings 320..-X in accord-
ance with ISO 355 and DIN 720, since they have the same mounting 
dimensions.
Axial
spherical plain bearings
Axial spherical plain bearings GE..-AW correspond to 
DIN ISO 12240-3. In these units, the shaft locating washer is 
supported in the ball socket-shaped sliding zone of the housing 
locating washer.
The sliding material in the housing locating washer is ELGOGLIDE® or, 
in the case of a nominal diameter d  220 mm, ELGOGLIDE® in X-life.
The bearings are available for shaft diameters from 10 mm
to 360 mm. Other sizes are available by agreement.
Area of application
The bearings are preferably used to support axial forces. They are 
suitable as support or base bearings and can also be combined with 
radial spherical plain bearings of dimension series E in accordance 
with DIN ISO 12240-1.
Axial spherical plain bearings GE..-AW of d  220 mm are X-life 
bearings and are indicated as such in the dimension tables.
These bearings have even higher performance materials, lower 
coefficients of friction and lower running-in wear than comparable 
bearings.

Spherical plain bearings,  

maintenance-free
Sliding layers
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings have special sliding 
layers based on polytetrafluorethylene PTFE in the outer ring.
In descending order of performance capability, these are:
■ELGOGLIDE®, the highest performance sliding layer
■ELGOGLIDE®-W11, the sliding layer for low friction
■PTFE film
■PTFE composite.
These materials form the slideway, transmit the forces occurring and 
perform the lubrication function.
Maintenance-free bearings must not be lubricated.
ELGOGLIDE®
The sliding layer comprises a 0,5 mm thick layer of ELGOGLIDE®,
is embedded in synthetic resin and attached by a high strength bond 
to the support body, Figure 1.
The flow behaviour of the sliding layer is, in conjunction with
the supporting body, almost negligible even under very high load. 
The adhesive bond is resistant to moisture and swelling.
ELGOGLIDE® is a registered trademark and product of Schaeffler.
ELGOGLIDE® designs
For differing requirements, the following are available:
■ELGOGLIDE®
the standard material for very high dynamic contact pressures 
from 25 N/mm2 to 300 N/mm2 and a long operating life
■ELGOGLIDE®-W11
the material for dynamic contact pressures from 1 N/mm2
to 100 N/mm2 and with low coefficients of friction even at
low contact pressures.

Sealing
Sealed radial spherical plain bearings have the suffix 2RS, 2RS2
or 2TS. They are protected by lip seals on both sides against 
contaminants and water spray.
Large radial spherical plain bearings GE..-DW-2RS2 have seals
with increased sealing action for very high requirements.
Radial spherical plain bearings GE..-UK-2TS and GE..-FW-2TS are 
sealed on both sides by integrated, triple lip high performance seals.
Angular contact and axial spherical plain bearings are not sealed but 
can be protected by means of an external seal, page 106.
Lubrication
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings do not have relubrication 
facilities and must not be lubricated.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings must be subjected to dry 
running-in. Any lubricant will impair the smoothing effect necessary 
and will considerably reduce the operating life of the bearings.

Spherical plain bearings,  

maintenance-free
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature is dependent on the sliding 
contact surface and the sealing arrangement, see table.
If the temperature exceeds the stated values, there will be
a reduction in the operating life and the effect of the sealing 
arrangement.
Operating temperature
1) Due to the different sliding layers in the series, these bearings are suitable,
if they are used without seals, for temperatures from –50 °C to +150 °C,
see table, page 139.
Temperature-resistant seals
If sealed bearings must be used at higher temperatures, an unsealed 
bearing with external, temperature-resistant seals can be used, 
Figure 4.

Spherical plain bearings,  

maintenance-free
Design and
safety guidelines
The chapter Technical principles brings together the essential 
guidelines on the subjects of operating clearance, the adjacent 
construction and mounting and dismounting, see section Technical 
principles, page 20.
Friction
The friction behaviour is dependent on the sliding contact surface 
and changes during the operating life. Calculation of the bearing 
frictional torque and the typical wear characteristics are given in
the chapter Technical principles, see section Friction and increases 
in temperature, page 69.
Running-in phase
During the running-in phase, PTFE particles are transferred from
the sliding layer to the opposing running surface. As a result,
the small roughness features of the inner ring surface are filled in.
It is only once this tribologically smooth surface is produced
in conjunction with the detached PTFE particles that the bearings can 
achieve a long operating life.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings do not have relubrication 
facilities and must not be lubricated.
Any lubrication of maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
after running-in will impair the smoothing effect necessary and
will considerably reduce the operating life of the bearings.
Design
of bearing arrangements
In the design of the adjacent construction, the guidelines
in the chapter Technical principles must be observed, see section 
Design of bearing arrangements, page 90.
Predimensioning
In the case of maintenance-free spherical plain bearings, 
predimensioning can be carried out, see page 31.
Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of maintenance-free spherical plain bearings is 
brought together in the chapter Technical principles, see section 
Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.

Rating life Lh
The rating life is calculated as follows:
Result
The ratio Fa/Fr for radial spherical plain bearings is in the valid range 

 0,3, but calculation of the rating life does not fulfil the required 
rating life Lh  8 500 h. For this reason, an angular contact spherical 
plain bearing GE50-SW is selected and calculated, see page 150.

Accuracy
The main dimensions as well as the dimensional and geometrical 
accuracy of the inside and outside diameter are in accordance
with DIN ISO 12240-1 to DIN ISO 12240-3.
The dimensional and tolerance values are arithmetic mean values 
and dimensional checking is carried out in accordance with 
ISO 8015.
Spherical plain bearings
with axially split or
radially split outer ring
Before surface treatment and axial splitting, the outside diameters 
are within the deviations given in the tables.
As a result of axial and radial splitting, the outer rings become 
slightly out of round. The roundness of the outer ring is restored
once it is mounted in a locating bore produced in accordance
with the specifications, Figure 5.
Measurements taken of the outside diameter of the unmounted 
bearing cannot be used as the original actual values for the outside 
diameter.

Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Features
Spherical plain bearings allow spatial adjustment movements and, 
depending on the bearing type, can support radial, combined or 
axial loads.
Radial
spherical plain bearings
Radial spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance comprise 
inner rings and outer rings with a steel/steel or steel/bronze sliding 
contact surface. The inner rings have a cylindrical bore with a curved 
outer slideway. The outer rings have a cylindrical outside surface and 
a concave inner slideway.
As a sliding contact surface, the series GE..-DO, GE..-HO, GE..-FO, 
GE..-LO and GE..-ZO have inner and outer rings made from steel. 
Series GE..-PB has a steel inner ring and a bronze outer ring.
Bearings of series GE-ZO are available in inch sizes.
The bearings are available in open designs and in designs sealed
on both sides, see dimension tables.
Spherical plain bearings GE..-LO have bore dimensions to standard 
sizes and dimensions in accordance with DIN 24338 for standard 
hydraulic cylinders.
Area of application
Radial spherical plain bearings can support radial forces, transmit 
motion and loads with low moment levels, thus keeping bending 
stresses away from the construction elements. The bearings are 
particularly suitable for alternating loads with impact and shock type 
stresses and support axial loads in both directions.
Outer ring
In bearings of diameter d  320 mm, the outer ring is axially split
at two points and held together by means of heavy-section retaining 
washers.
Inner ring
GE..-FO and GE..-FO-2RS(-2TS) have extended inner rings.
As a result, larger tilt angles are possible.
GE..-HO-2RS has cylindrical extensions on the inner ring. As a result, 
spacer rings are not required if the bearing is mounted in a clevis.
Sealing
Sealed bearings have the suffix 2RS, 2TS or 2RS4. They are protected 
by lip seals on both sides against contaminants and water spray.
Radial spherical plain bearings GE..-DO-2TS and GE..-FO-2TS are 
sealed on both sides by integrated, triple lip high performance seals.
Large radial spherical plain bearings GE..-DO-2RS4 have seals with 
increased sealing action for very high requirements.
Lubrication
Radial spherical plain bearings are lubricated via the outer and inner 
ring. For exceptions, see dimension table. Under alternating load, 
one side is relieved of load and this zone is lubricated by the swivel 
motion of the bearing.

Series, sliding contact surface,
standard
Radial spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance are designed 
according to their specific series with different sliding contact 
surfaces, see table.
Series and design
1) Radial spherical plain bearings GE..-ZO are available in inch sizes and
with a shaft diameter from 0,75 inch to 5 inch.
Angular contact
spherical plain bearings
Angular contact spherical plain bearings GE..-SX correspond to 
DIN ISO 12240-2. They have inner rings with a curved outer slideway 
and outer rings with a concave inner slideway, where a steel/steel 
sliding contact surface is present.
The bearings are available for shaft diameters from 25 mm to 
200 mm. Other sizes are available by agreement.
Area of application
Angular contact spherical plain bearings can support axial forces
as well as radial forces. As a result, they are suitable for alternating 
dynamic loads.
The bearings are used where loads acting in conjunction with small 
swivel angles would damage rolling element bearings. They are
a good plain bearing alternative to tapered roller bearings 320..-X
in accordance with ISO 355 and DIN 720, since they have the same 
mounting dimensions.
Since motion and loads are transmitted with low moment levels, 
bending stresses are kept away from the construction elements.
Sealing
Angular contact spherical plain bearings are not sealed.
Lubrication
The bearings are intended as standard for grease lubrication and
are lubricated via the outer ring.

Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Axial
spherical plain bearings
Axial spherical plain bearings GE..-AX correspond to
DIN ISO 12240-3. In these units, the shaft locating washer is 
supported in the ball socket-shaped sliding zone of the housing 
locating washer, where a steel/steel sliding contact surface is 
present.
The bearings are available for shaft diameters from 10 mm to 
200 mm. Other sizes are available by agreement.
Area of application
The bearings can support axial forces and transmit support forces 
with low moment levels into the adjacent construction. In order
to support radial forces, they can be combined with radial spherical 
plain bearings of dimension series E in accordance with 
DIN ISO 12240-1.
Sealing
Axial spherical plain bearings are not sealed.
Lubrication
The bearings are lubricated via the housing locating washer.
Bearing materials
Radial spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance are made 
from high grade rolling bearing steel and have a steel/steel or 
steel/bronze sliding contact surface. 
The steel bearing rings are hardened, ground and surface treated. 
Manganese phosphating with subsequent molybdenum disulphide 
coating has proved effective as a surface treatment. As a result,
the bearings can fulfil high requirements for wear resistance and
the effective separation of the metallic surfaces gives optimum 
running-in characteristics.
Steel/steel sliding contact surface
The inner and outer rings and the shaft and housing locating 
washers are made from a martensitic or bainitic hardened structure 
with a low residual austenite content.
Steel/bronze sliding
contact surface
The inner ring is made from hardened and ground rolling bearing 
steel and the curved surface is finished.
The outer ring is made from bronze which is formed around the inner 
ring. The outside surface is subsequently precision machined.

Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature is dependent on the sliding 
contact surface and the sealing arrangement, see table.
If the temperature exceeds the stated values, there will be
a reduction in the operating life and the effect of the sealing 
arrangement.
Operating temperature
1) Suitable without seals for temperatures from –60 °C to +200 °C.
Temperature-resistant seals
If sealed bearings must be used at higher temperatures, unsealed 
bearings with external, temperature-resistant seals can be used,

Design and
safety guidelines
The chapter Technical principles brings together the essential 
guidelines on the subjects of operating clearance, the adjacent 
construction and mounting and dismounting, see section Technical 
principles, page 20.
Friction
The friction behaviour is dependent on the sliding contact surface 
and changes during the operating life. Calculation of the bearing 
frictional torque and the typical coefficients of friction are given
in the chapter Technical principles, see section Friction and 
increases in temperature, page 69.
Principles of lubrication
Spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel sliding contact surface 
requiring maintenance are given a special surface treatment and are 
provided with MoS2. Nevertheless, the quality of maintenance has
a considerable influence on the function and wear of spherical plain 
bearings.
Functions of the lubricant
The functions of the lubricant are as follows, Figure 2:
■A lubricant film is formed on the contact surfaces that is 
sufficiently capable of supporting loads and thus preventing 
wear and premature fatigue .
■When grease lubrication is used, the bearing is additionally 
sealed against the entry of both solid and fluid contaminants .
■It gives protection against corrosion .
It is more important to use a suitable lubricant than to provide 
generously defined, short lubrication intervals. The lubricant must 
always be selected in consultation with the lubricant manufacturers.

Schaeffler Technologies
Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Selection of lubricant
The lubricant is selected as a function of the sliding contact surface 
in the bearing.
The following criteria must be considered:
■the load
■the load direction
■the swivel angle
■the sliding velocity
■the ambient temperature
■the environmental conditions.
Steel/steel
sliding contact surface
For standard applications, conventional, corrosion-inhibiting,
high-pressure greases with a lithium soap base, EP additives and 
solid lubricant additives are suitable.
The composition of suitable lubricants is as follows:
■a proportion of approx. 3% MoS2
■solid additives based on calcium and zinc phosphate 
compounds. Even under high contact pressure, these additives 
separate the sliding surfaces from each other.
Steel/bronze
sliding contact surface
Conventional, corrosion-inhibiting, water-repellent lithium soap 
greases of normal consistency are suitable.
Lubricants with MoS2 additives or other solid lubricants must not
be used.
Running-in phase
The running-in phase has a significant influence on the later wear 
behaviour of the bearing. Correct lubrication is therefore of particular 
importance at this point.
During running-in, the surfaces of the contact zones undergo 
smoothing and elastic moulding. This gives additional load-bearing 
areas and reduces the strain on the material.
Guidelines on greasing
During the running-in phase, the pressure in the bearing is particu-
larly high. The spherical plain bearings are therefore manganese 
phosphated and treated with MoS2. The running-in wear phase 
proceeds all the more favourably the more MoS2 is embedded
in the porous-crystalline manganese phosphate.
This process is at its most effective with the following sequence:
■the bearing is subjected to about ten swivel motions under load 
without additional greasing
■the bearing is then given its initial greasing.
If this is not possible, the initial greasing must be metered carefully 
in order to avoid flushing an excessive quantity of MoS2 out
of the bearing.

181
Relubrication
During relubrication, old grease is replaced by fresh grease.
At the same time, the grease flushes wear debris and contaminants 
out of the bearing.
Bearings with a steel/steel sliding contact surface must be period-
ically relubricated. The relubrication intervals should not be estab-
lished arbitrarily but determined by calculation as part of the rating 
life calculation (correction factor fNH). Alternatively, this should be 
determined in consultation with the lubricant manufacturer.
The bearings should also be relubricated before long periods 
without operation.
If relubrication is carried out too frequently, the operating life
of the bearing may be reduced, since the friction of spherical plain 
bearings always increases for a short time after relubrication.
Relubrication conditions
The grease used for relubrication must be the same as that used
in initial greasing.
If other greases are used, the miscibility and compatibility
of the greases must be checked.
The following conditions should be used for relubrication:
■The bearing should still be warm from operation.
■It should always be carried out before the bearing comes to rest.
■Relubrication should continue until a fresh collar of grease 
appears at the seal gaps. Old grease must be allowed to leave
the bearing unhindered.
Design
of bearing arrangements
In the design of the adjacent construction, the guidelines
in the chapter Technical principles must be observed, see section 
Design of bearing arrangements, page 90.

Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Predimensioning
In the case of spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance, 
predimensioning can be carried out, see page 33.
Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance 
is brought together in the chapter Technical principles, see section 
Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.
Calculation example
for radial spherical
plain bearing GE50-DO
The rating life of the radial spherical plain bearing is calculated
on the basis of the steel/steel sliding contact surface, see section 
Load carrying capacity and life, page 35.
Given data
The given data for calculation of the rating life are as follows:
■pivot of a linkage rod
■axial and radial alternating load.

Checking of permissible loads
The validity of the permissible loads and sliding velocities must be 
checked, since useful rating life calculation is only possible within 
this range, see tables, page 50.
Combined load
For calculation of the combined load, the factor X must be deter-
mined from the diagram for radial spherical plain bearings using
the ratio Fa/Fr = 5 000 N / 25 000 N = 0,2, Figure 4, page 39:
Specific bearing load
The specific bearing load must be calculated with the aid of
the specific load parameter K and checked for validity, see table, 
page 41, and table, page 50:
Sliding velocity in swivel motion
The sliding velocity must be calculated with the aid of the sphere 
diameter dK and the swivel angle  and checked for validity,
see table, page 44, and table, page 50:
Specific frictional energy pv
The specific frictional energy pv must be checked for validity,
see table, page 50:

Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Determining
the rating life equation
For calculation of the rating life, the valid rating life equation must be 
selected and then subjected to correction.
Selection
of the valid rating life equation
For plain bearings requiring maintenance, the following applies,
see page 52:
The correction factors necessary for the steel/steel sliding contact 
surface must be selected from the matrix and used to correct
the rating life equation appropriately, see table, page 55 and
equation.
Correction factors,
as a function of bearing type
Rating life equation

Calculation of rating life
The values for the correction factors in the corrected rating life 
equation must be taken from the diagrams, see page 56 and table.
The specific plain bearing factor KL = 30, see table, page 52.

Rating life LhN
with periodic relubrication
The rating life can be increased by means of periodic relubrication
as a function of the relubrication interval, see page 52.
The necessary relubrication interval and preferred relubrication 
interval must be calculated and checked for validity, see page 68 
and page 182:
Based on a relubrication frequency Lh/lW = 467 h/16 h = 29,19,
a correction factor fNH = 4,7 is determined, Figure 31, page 68.
Based on a swivel angle  = 35°, the correction factor fN = 5,6, 
Figure 32, page 68.
Result
The selected radial spherical plain bearing GE50-DO fulfils
the requirement for a rating life Lh  10 000 h.

Spherical plain bearings, 
requiring maintenance
Accuracy
The main dimensions as well as the dimensional and geometrical 
accuracy of the inside and outside diameter are in accordance with 
DIN ISO 12240-1 to DIN ISO 12240-3. The exceptions are radial 
spherical plain bearings of series GE..-HO-2RS and spherical plain 
bearings GE..-ZO in inch sizes.
The dimensional and tolerance values are arithmetic mean values 
and dimensional checking is carried out in accordance with 
ISO 8015.
As a result of the surface treatment, the tolerances of spherical plain 
bearings with a steel/steel sliding contact surface may differ slightly 
from the stated values. However, this does not affect the mounting 
and operating characteristics.
Spherical plain bearings
with axially split or
radially split outer ring
Before surface treatment and axial splitting, the outside diameters 
are within the deviations given in the tables. As a result of axial
and radial splitting, the outer rings become slightly out of round.
The roundness of the outer ring is restored once it is fitted in
a locating bore produced in accordance with the specifications, 
Figure 3.
Measurements taken of the outside diameter of the unmounted 
bearing cannot be used as the original actual values for the outside 
diameter.

ELGES rod ends
Rod ends,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 212
Maintenance-free rod ends comprise a housing with integral shank 
and a maintenance-free spherical plain bearing. The integral shank 
has an internal or external thread. The spherical plain bearing is 
firmly seated and located in the housing. The housings and shanks 
are protected against corrosion by a zinc coating.
The rod ends can support radial loads in a tensile or compressive 
direction. They are suitable for slow movements with small
to moderate swivel angles, for unilateral load and under certain 
conditions for alternating loads (also suitable for alternating loads 
with GE..-UK-2RS). Sealed rod ends have lip seals on both sides
and are thus protected against contamination and water spray.
Corrosion-resistant rod ends,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 212
Corrosion-resistant rod ends made from high-grade steel correspond 
in their construction to the maintenance-free rod ends but are
of a corrosion-resistant design.
The preferred areas of application include machinery for the food 
and drink industry, butchery machines, the chemical industry and 
medical equipment. The products have also proven effective in 
aircraft and ship building as well as for applications in buses and
rail vehicles.
Rod ends with CETOP mounting dimensions are often used in control 
and automation engineering.
Rod ends and
hydraulic rod ends,
requiring maintenance
................................................................................................................. 244
Rod ends requiring maintenance comprise a housing with integral 
shank and a spherical plain bearing requiring maintenance. In other 
respects, the construction corresponds to that of maintenance-free 
rod ends.
Hydraulic rod ends requiring maintenance incorporate radial 
spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel sliding contact surface. 
The rod ends can be screw mounted using a thread in the shank or 
welded in place by means of circular or rectangular welding faces.
In the case of rod ends with a thread clamping facility, the spherical 
plain bearings are axially located in the housing by means
of retaining rings.

Rod ends, maintenance-free
Features
Maintenance-free rod ends and maintenance-free corrosion-
resistant rod ends comprise a housing with integral shank and
a maintenance-free spherical plain bearing. The shank has
an internal or external thread, the spherical plain bearing is firmly 
seated and located in the housing.
The rod ends are available in open designs and in designs sealed
on both sides. The housings and shanks are protected against 
corrosion by a zinc coating.
The sliding layer between the inner ring and outer ring is PTFE 
composite, ELGOGLIDE® or PTFE film, see page 140.
Area of application
Maintenance-free rod ends can support radial loads in a tensile or 
compressive direction. They are particularly suitable for slow 
movements with small to moderate swivel angles and unilateral 
loads. For alternating loads, rod ends with bearings of series
GE..-UK-2RS(-2TS) and GE..-FW-2RS(-2TS) can be used.
Dimension series E
Rod ends to DIN ISO 12240-4, dimension series E incorporate radial 
spherical plain bearings GE..-UK or GE..-UK-2RS(-2TS) and have
a right or left internal or external thread, Figure 1. The sliding contact 
surfaces are hard chromium/PTFE composite or hard chromium/
ELGOGLIDE®. The thin walled design of the eye housing allows 
compact adjacent constructions. These rod ends are also available 
by agreement with radial spherical plain bearings GE..-FW or
GE..-FW-2RS(-2TS) of dimension series G.

Materials
Maintenance-free rod ends fulfil all the requirements in terms
of fatigue and wear resistance, hardness, toughness and structural 
stability as well as maintenance-free operation.
Maintenance-free rod ends are manufactured from drop forged 
quenched and tempered steel C45 QT in accordance with 
DIN EN 10083-2 and have a zinc coated surface.
Corrosion-resistant rod ends have an inner ring made from
a corrosion-resistant steel such as X105CrMo17. The outer ring and 
the housing are made from X8CrNiS18-9. Alternative materials are 
permissible.
Sealing
Sealed rod ends of dimension series E have the suffix 2RS or 2TS. 
They are protected by lip seals on both sides against contaminants 
and water spray. Rod ends GIR..-UK-2TS, GIL..-UK-2TS, GAR..-UK-2TS 
and GAL..-UK-2TS are sealed on both sides by integrated, triple lip 
high performance seals.
Rod ends of dimension series K are not sealed.
Lubrication
During the running-in phase, PTFE particles are transferred from
the sliding layer to the opposing running surface. As a result,
the small roughness features of the inner ring surface are filled in.
It is only once this tribologically smooth surface is produced
in conjunction with the detached PTFE particles that the bearings can 
achieve a long operating life.
Maintenance-free rod ends do not have relubrication facilities and 
must not be lubricated.
Any lubrication of maintenance-free rod ends after running-in will 
impair the smoothing effect necessary and will considerably reduce 
the operating life of the bearings.

Rod ends, maintenance-free
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature is dependent on the sliding 
contact surface and the sealing arrangement, see table.
If the temperature exceeds the stated values, there will be
a reduction in the operating life and the effect of the sealing 
arrangement.
At temperatures below 0 °C, a reduction in the load carrying capacity 
of the rod ends must be taken into consideration.

Design and
safety guidelines
The chapter Technical principles brings together the essential 
guidelines on the subjects of friction, rating life and the adjacent 
construction, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Dimensioning
In the case of rod ends, the permissible static load of the housing 
and shank must always be checked. In calculation of the rating life
of the rod end, the decisive factor is the rating life of the spherical 
plain bearing fitted in the housing, see page 47.
The direction of load and the type of load determine the design
of the rod end and the sliding contact surface of the spherical plain 
bearing.
Permissible loading of rod ends
The permissible load depends on the type of load.
Pulsating or alternating loads subject the material of the rod ends to 
greater stress than constant loads. For calculation, these operating 
conditions must be taken into consideration by means of the load 
factor fb, see table, page 222.
The maximum equivalent bearing load P must not exceed the per-
missible load on the rod end Pper, see equation.
In the case of rod ends with the sliding material ELGOGLIDE®, the basic 
static load rating C0r of the rod end is lower than the basic dynamic 
load rating Cr of the bearing.
Loading of rod end
The following applies:
The permissible load on the rod end Pper is calculated as follows:

Schaeffler Technologies
Rod ends, maintenance-free
Load factors
Basic static load rating
In this case, the basic static load rating C0r indicates the load 
carrying capacity of the housing and shank under static tensile load, 
see dimension table. At room temperature, it includes a safety factor 
of at least 1,2 in relation to the yield strength of the material used for 
the housing and shank. The basic load rating describes the 
maximum permissible static tensile load when utilising 83% of the 
material yield strength at the most highly stressed cross-section.
The basic static load rating C0r of the rod end refers only to the load 
carrying capacity of the rod end housing, see dimension table.
It is based on tensile and compressive loads acting across or
in the direction of the rod end shank.
If the basic static load rating C0r is used to the full, the shaft and 
housing must be made from high-strength materials.
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating Cr refers to the spherical plain bearing 
fitted and is a parameter for calculating the bearing rating life,
see dimension table. It is dependent on the sliding contact surface 
and has a significant influence on the rating life of the rod ends.
The equivalent bearing load and additional bending stresses
in the shank area must be taken into consideration if, in addition
to radial load in a tensile or compressive direction, other transverse 
forces act in an axial direction to the shank.

Checking of permissible loads
The validity of the permissible loads and sliding velocities must be 
checked, since useful rating life calculation is only possible within 
this range, see tables, page 50.
Combined load
For calculation of the combined load, the factor X must be deter-
mined from the diagram for radial spherical plain bearings using
the ratio Fa/Fr = 1200 N / 16 000 N = 0,075, Figure 4, page 39:
Specific bearing load
The specific bearing load must be calculated with the aid
of the specific load parameter K and checked for validity, see table, 
page 41, and table, page 50:
Sliding velocity in swivel motion
The sliding velocity must be calculated with the aid of the sphere 
diameter dK and the swivel angle  and checked for validity,
see table, page 44, and table, page 50:
Specific frictional energy pv
The specific frictional energy pv must be checked for validity,
see table, page 50:
Permissible load on the rod end
The load carrying capacity of the rod end must be considered 
separately from that of the spherical plain bearing. Calculation
of the load carrying capacity required should be carried out using
the load factor fb, see table, page 222.
The rod end GAR25-UK with a housing having a basic load rating 
C0r = 105 000 N is suitable.

Determining
the rating life equation
For calculation of the rating life, the valid rating life equation must be 
selected and then subjected to correction.
Selection
of the valid rating life equation
For maintenance-free plain bearings, the following applies,
see page 52:
The correction factors necessary for the plain bearing material
PTFE composite must be selected from the matrix and used to correct 
the rating life equation appropriately, see table, page 55, and
equation.
Correction factors,
as a function of bearing type
Rating life equation
following correction
Calculation of rating life
The values for the correction factors in the corrected rating life 
equation must be taken from the diagrams, see page 56 and table.
The specific plain bearing factor KL = 1000, see table, page 52.
Correction factors
Rating life Lh
The rating life is calculated as follows:
Result
The selected rod end GAR25-UK fulfils the requirement for a rating 
life Lh  6 000 h.

Accuracy
The main dimensions of the rod ends conform to DIN ISO 12240-4.
All connecting threads have metric dimensions to DIN 13, tolerance 
class central, 6H, 6g.
The stated thread length is the minimum usable length, based on 
normal chamfering practice for the thread of the mating component.

Rod ends and hydraulic rod ends, 
requiring maintenance
Features
Rod ends requiring maintenance and hydraulic rod ends incorporate 
spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel sliding contact surface. 
Schaeffler can also supply spherical plain bearings with a steel/
bronze sliding contact surface.
Rod ends
requiring maintenance
Rod ends requiring maintenance comprise a housing with integral 
shank and a spherical plain bearing requiring maintenance.
The shank has an internal or external thread, the spherical plain 
bearing is firmly seated and located in the housing.
The rod ends are available in open designs and in designs sealed
on both sides. The housings and shanks are protected against 
corrosion by a zinc coating.
Area of application
Rod ends requiring maintenance can support radial forces
in a tensile or compressive direction and can transmit motions and 
forces with low moment levels. They are particularly suitable for 
alternating radial loads and, in certain circumstances, for unilateral 
loads. The thin walled design of the eye housing allows compact 
adjacent constructions.
Dimension series E
Rod ends to DIN ISO 12240-4, dimension series E incorporate radial 
spherical plain bearings GE..-DO or GE..-DO-2RS(-2TS) and have
a right or left hand internal or external thread. The sliding contact 
surface is formed by steel inner and outer rings, Figure 1.

diameter d 
 50 mm. Rod ends GIHRK are slotted on one side from 
d  60 mm and rod ends GIHNRK are slotted on one side from 
d  63 mm.
Area of application
Hydraulic rod ends can support radial forces in a tensile or com-
pressive direction and can transmit motions and forces with low 
moment levels. They are also suitable for alternating radial loads.
Hydraulic rod ends
with thread clamping device
The spherical plain bearings used are located in the rod end
by means of retaining rings. A thread clamping facility comprising
two hexagonal socket screws to DIN EN ISO 4762 is present on
the threaded shank, Figure 3.
Rod ends GIHNRK..-LO conform to DIN 24338 and ISO 6982.
They are used in standard hydraulic cylinders to CETOP recommen-
dation RP 58 H and to the standards DIN 24333, DIN 24336,

Design and
safety guidelines
The chapter Technical principles brings together the essential 
guidelines on the subjects of friction, rating life and the adjacent 
construction, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Principles of lubrication
The lubrication of spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance is 
covered in detail in the corresponding chapter for spherical plain 
bearings, see page 179.
Relubrication
Rod ends requiring maintenance must be lubricated.
They have relubrication facilities, except for smaller rod ends
of some series that do not have lubrication grooves and lubrication 
holes. These rod ends are indicated in the dimension tables.
Rod ends to DIN ISO 12240-4, dimension series E with bore diameter 
d = 15 mm to 20 mm are relubricated via a hole in the rod end eye 
housing, Figure 5. For reasons of housing strength, these rod ends 
do not have lubrication nipples.

Schaeffler Technologies
Rod ends and hydraulic rod ends, 
requiring maintenance
Dimensioning
In the case of rod ends, the permissible static load of the housing 
and shank must always be checked. In calculation of the rating life
of the rod end, the decisive factor is the rating life of the spherical 
plain bearing fitted in the housing, see page 47.
The direction of load and the type of load determine the design
of the rod end and the sliding contact surface of the spherical plain 
bearing.
Permissible loading of rod ends
The permissible load depends on the type of load.
Pulsating or alternating loads subject the material of the rod ends to 
greater stress than constant loads. For calculation, these operating 
conditions must be taken into consideration by means of the load 
factor fb, see table.
The maximum equivalent bearing load P must not exceed the per-
missible load on the rod end Pper, see equation.
Loading of rod end
The following applies:
The permissible load on the rod end P is calculated as follows:

Basic static load rating
In this case, the basic static load rating C0r indicates the load 
carrying capacity of the housing and shank under static tensile load, 
see dimension table. At room temperature, it includes a safety
factor of at least 1,2 in relation to the yield strength of the material 
used for the housing and shank. The basic load rating describes
the maximum permissible static tensile load when utilising 83% of 
the material yield strength at the most highly stressed cross-section.
The basic static load rating C0r of the rod end refers only to the load 
carrying capacity of the rod end housing, see dimension table. It is 
based on tensile and compressive loads acting across or in
the direction of the rod end shank.
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating Cr refers to the spherical plain bearing 
fitted and is a parameter for calculating the bearing rating life,
see dimension table. It is dependent on the sliding contact surface 
and has a significant influence on the rating life of the rod ends.
The equivalent bearing load and additional bending stresses
in the shank area must be taken into consideration if, in addition
to radial load in a tensile or compressive direction, other transverse 
forces act in an axial direction to the shank.
Calculation example
for radial rod end GIKR25-PB
The rating life of the radial spherical plain bearing is calculated
on the basis of the steel/bronze sliding contact surface, see section 
Load carrying capacity and life, page 35.

the load factor fb = 3, see table, page 258.
The rod end GIKR25-PB with the basic load rating C0r = 72 900 N is 
suitable.
Checking of permissible loads
The validity of the permissible loads and sliding velocities must be 
checked, since useful rating life calculation is only possible within 
this range, see tables, page 50.
Specific bearing load
The specific bearing load must be calculated with the aid of
the specific load parameter K and checked for validity, see table, 
page 41 and table, page 50. In the case of a concentrically acting, 
variable force F, P = Fmax = 20 000 N:

Rating life LhN
with periodic relubrication
The rating life can be increased by means of periodic relubrication
as a function of the relubrication interval, see page 68.
The necessary relubrication interval and preferred relubrication 
interval must be calculated and checked for validity, see page 68:
Based on a relubrication frequency Lh/lW = 280 h/40 h = 7,
a correction factor fNH = 2,1 is determined, Figure 31, page 68. 
Based on a swivel angle  = 45°, the correction factor fN = 3,2, 
Figure 32, page 68.
Taking account
of the operating duration
3 s/cycle gives 20 cycles/min at a utilisation of 100%. The number 
of indexing operations of 300 cycles/h gives 5 cycles/min.
The operating duration ED is calculated as follows:

The selected radial rod end GIKR25-PB fulfils the requirement

Welding
of hydraulic rod ends
The thermal distortion occurring during welding must be kept
as small as possible.
Recommendation
The following procedure has proved effective in the welding of rod 
ends:
■The thickness of the weld seam should be as small as possible. 
This should be based on the load.
■If thicker weld seams are necessary, these should be welded
in several layers.
■Electrodes with low heat generation should be used, such as 
Kb electrodes.
■The current strength selected for welding should be towards
the lower limit.
Welding current must not pass through the rod end, otherwise 
macroscopic protrusions may occurr on the curved inner or outer 
rings.

Plain bushes
Metal/polymer composite
plain bushes,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 286
The maintenance-free plain bearing material E40 is, due to the use
of PTFE, intended for dry running. These bearings are particularly 
suitable where the bearing position must be maintenance-free,
there is a risk of lubricant starvation or where lubricant is unaccept-
able or undesirable. E40 can be used for rotary and oscillating 
motion as well as for short stroke linear motion.
The bearings are rolled from a cut section of strip and have a butt 
joint over the entire width of the bearing. Typical areas of application 
can be found, for example, in fluid technology, in sports gear,
in medical or electrical equipment as well as in automotive 
engineering.
ELGOTEX®
filament wound bushes,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 320
The maintenance-free wound bushes made from filament composite 
are non-metallic and thus resistant to numerous media. They have 
low mass, are resistant to shocks and vibration and have a low 
coefficient of friction. Lubrication of the bearings is not necessary. 
The performance capability of the bearings is higher than the 
metal/polymer composite plain bearings and lower than ELGOGLIDE® 
plain bushes.
These plain bushes are highly suitable for use in construction 
machinery, conveying equipment, transportation vehicles, hydraulic 
applications and solar energy plant.
ELGOGLIDE®
plain bushes,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 334
The maintenance-free, solid section plain bushes offer very high 
load carrying capacity in the same design envelope. The sliding layer 
ELGOGLIDE® gives very long life and is particularly suitable for high 
alternating loads and swivel motions.
ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes can support very high radial forces as well 
as high static loads with a unilateral load direction. They have a very 
low coefficient of friction.
Typical areas of application include construction and agricultural 
machinery as well as conveying equipment, civil engineering and 
shipbuilding.
Metal/polymer composite
plain bushes,
low-maintenance
................................................................................................................. 344
The low-maintenance plain bearing material E50 with a sliding layer 
made from POM has low wear, good damping characteristics and 
long relubrication intervals. E50 can be used for rotary and oscil-
lating motion and is recommended for long stroke linear motion.
The bearings are rolled from a cut section of strip and have a butt 
joint over the entire width of the bearing. Application examples can 
be found in particular in the area of production machinery, construc-
tion and agricultural equipment as well as commercial vehicles.

Maintenance-free
plain bearing material
For maintenance-free metal/polymer composite plain bearings from 
Schaeffler, the sliding material E40 and E40-B is used. The basis
of the dry lubricant is polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE with embedded 
chemically non-reactive additives.
In the three-layered material, the steel or bronze backing has
a sintered porous tin/bronze sliding layer whose pores are filled with 
the superimposed running-in layer, see table, Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
The running-in layer is a plastic composite comprising PTFE and 
additives.

Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The resistance of the material E40 depends on the chemical 
characteristics of the individual layers:
■The material E40 is resistant to water, alcohols, glycols and 
numerous mineral and synthetic oils.
■The tin-plated steel surface gives adequate protection against 
corrosion in most cases.
■In the case of the material E40-B, the bronze backing is 
additionally resistant to water vapour and seawater.
The material E40 is not resistant to acidic media (pH  5) and 
alkaline media (pH  9). The bronze backing of E40-B is not resistant 
to oxidising acids and gases such as free halides, ammonia or 
hydrogen sulphide, especially if these gases have a high moisture 
content.
Technical data for E40
The sliding layer E40 is maintenance-free. It can be used for rotary 
and oscillating motion as well as for short stroke linear motion.
The low-wear material has good sliding characteristics (no stick-
slip), a low coefficient of friction and high resistance to chemicals.
It does not absorb water (it is highly resistant to swelling), does
not tend to weld to metal and is also suitable for hydrodynamic 
operation.
Maintenance-free plain bushes are available in the variants E40 and 
E40-B with the following mechanical and physical characteristics, 
see table.

Metal/polymer composite plain bushes,

Sealing
The plain bearings are not sealed, but can be protected against
the ingress of contamination and moisture by the use of external 
seals, see page 115.
Lubrication
Plain bearings with the sliding layer E40 contain dry lubricants and 
do not therefore require lubrication.
Lubrication can be used to protect the mating surface against cor-
rosion or simply to provide sealing against contamination. It should 
be checked in advance, however, whether it is more advantageous
in such cases to use a corrosion-resistant material for the mating 
surface or a different means of sealing the bearing position.
In certain applications, the sliding layer E40 can be used in fluid 
media. In this case, the improved heat dissipation may considerably 
increase the operating life.
The compatibility of the media with the sliding layer E40 must be 
checked. Further advice should therefore be sought from
the Schaeffler engineering service.
Lubricants
Oil and grease lubrication, even in very small quantities, impairs
the transfer of material during the running-in phase.
Over time, grease and small quantities of oil mix with wear debris
to form a paste that promotes wear. Solid lubricants such as
zinc sulphide, molybdenum disulphide or similar grease additives 
are not permitted, since they promote this paste formation to
an increased extent.
Relubrication
If it is not possible in exceptional cases to avoid the use of grease 
lubrication, the bearings must be relubricated periodically. During 
relubrication, old grease is replaced by fresh grease. At the same 
time, the grease flushes wear debris and contaminants out
of the bearing.
If periodic relubrication is carried out, the formation of paste 
comprising debris and contaminants must be avoided.
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature for maintenance-free 
metal/polymer composite plain bearings is between –200 °C and 
+280 °C.
The running-in layer and sliding layer may undergo swelling in
the presence of some mineral oils at temperatures above +100 °C. 
This could lead to jamming of the bearing.
This can be remedied by increasing the bearing clearance, since 
other characteristics of the sliding layer E40 are unaffected.

Design and
safety guidelines
In addition to the design and safety guidelines described here,
the following guidelines in the Technical principles must also be 
observed:
■theoretical bearing clearance of metal/polymer composite plain 
bushes, see page 81
■design of bearing arrangements, see page 90
■recommended mounting tolerances, see page 102
■misalignment of plain bushes, see page 103, and edge loading
of metal/polymer composite plain bushes, see page 103
■pressing in of bushes, see page 120.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving spatial 
motion. Any skewing of the shaft will reduce the operating life.
Friction
Sliding motion is free from stick-slip.
The friction in a plain bearing is influenced by:
■the roughness depth of the mating surface
■the mating surface material
■the specific bearing load
■the sliding velocity
■the operating temperature
– Up to approx. +100 °C, the coefficient of friction is slightly 
lower than the value at room temperature.
– Above +100 °C, the coefficient of friction may be up to 50% 
above the value at room temperature.
Friction behaviour
The coefficient of friction is lower under high specific bearing load 
and low sliding velocity. The coefficients of friction stated are valid 
for the condition after running-in, see table.
Coefficient of friction
for sliding layer E40
Bearing frictional torque
Calculation of the bearing frictional torque and the typical wear 
characteristics are given in the chapter Technical principles,
see section Friction and increases in temperature, page 69.

Running-in process
During the running-in process, part of the running-in layer is 
transferred to the mating surface, Figure 3:
■This compensates uneven areas.
■A mating surface with a low coefficient of friction is formed,
which acts favourably on the operating behaviour.
■After running in, some of the porous bronze layer is visible
on the sliding layer as individual areas of differing sizes, Figure 4. 
This shows that the bearing is running correctly.

Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of plain bushes is summarised in the chapter 
Technical principles, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.
Calculation example for
flanged bush EGF30260-E40
The rating life of the flanged bush is calculated on the basis of
the sliding layer E40, see section Load carrying capacity and life, 
page 35. For flanged bushes, the rating life must be checked for both 
the radial sliding surface and the axial sliding surface (flange).
Given data
The given data for calculation of the rating life are as follows:
■bearing arrangement for an extruder shaft
■shaft and axial running surface ground (unalloyed steel, 
roughness depth Rz2)
■point load (rotating shaft, stationary bush).

Checking of permissible loads
For flanged bushes, the rating life must be checked for both
the radial sliding surface and the axial sliding surface (flange).
The validity of the permissible loads and sliding velocities must be 
checked, since useful rating life calculation is only possible within 
this range, see tables, page 50.

Determining
the rating life equation
For calculation of the rating life, the valid rating life equation must be 
selected and then subjected to correction.
Selection
of the valid rating life equation
For maintenance-free plain bearings, the following applies,
see page 52:
The correction factors necessary for the plain bearing material E40 
must be selected from the matrix and used to correct the rating life 
equation appropriately, see table, page 55, and equation.
Correction factors,

Calculation of rating life
The values for the correction factors in the corrected rating life 
equation must be taken from the diagrams, see page 56 and table.
The specific plain bearing factor KL = 1000, see table, page 52.

Rating life Lh
The rating life for the radial sliding surface is calculated as follows:
The rating life for the axial sliding surface is calculated as follows:
Result
The basic rating life is determined by the radial sliding surface.
The total rating life is therefore 560 h. The selected flanged bush 
fulfils the required rating life Lh  500 h.

Hydrodynamic operation
Metal/polymer composite plain bearings with the sliding layer E40 
can be operated under hydrodynamic conditions. Higher circumfer-
ential speeds are permissible than with dry running.
Once the transition speed is reached, pure fluid friction is present. 
This allows wear-free operation.
At speeds below the transition speed, mixed friction is present and 
the self-lubricating effect of the sliding layer is utilised.
For hydrodynamic operation with the sliding layer E40,
the roughness Rz of the mating surface should be less than
the smallest lubricant film thickness in fluid friction.
Schaeffler offers the calculation of hydrodynamic conditions
for plain bearings as a service.
Calculation
For the calculation of hydrodynamic conditions, the following data 
are necessary:
■load
■speed
■diameter of the housing bore dG with tolerance
■diameter of the shaft dW with tolerance
■bush width B
■viscosity of the fluid at operating temperature.
Shaft design
The shafts should be chamfered and all sharp edges should be 
rounded. This allows easier mounting and prevents damage
to the sliding layer of the bush.
Mating surface
The mating surface should always be wider than the bearing
to prevent the formation of steps in the sliding layer.
The optimum operating life in dry running of the sliding layer E40 is 
achieved with a roughness depth of the mating surface of Rz2 to Rz3.
Very small roughness values do not have a beneficial effect
on the operating life, but larger roughness values reduce it 
considerably.

Metal/polymer composite plain bushes,

Surface quality
Ground or drawn surfaces are preferable as a mating surface. 
Surfaces that have been precision turned or rolled by precision 
turning, even with Rz2 to Rz3, can cause greater wear since helical 
manufacturing grooves are created by precision turning.
Spheroidal graphite cast iron GGG has an open surface structure and 
should therefore be ground to Rz2 or better.
The direction of rotation of cast shafts in the application should be 
the same as that of the grinding wheel during machining, since 
increased wear should be anticipated if rotation is in the opposing 
direction, Figure 6.
Heat dissipation
Correct and sufficient heat dissipation must be ensured:
■If hydrodynamic operation is present, the heat is dissipated 
predominantly via the fluid lubricant.
■In the case of maintenance-free plain bearings, the heat is 
dissipated via the housing and shaft.
Protection against corrosion
Corrosion of the mating surface in the case of the sliding layer E40
is prevented by sealing or the use of corrosion-resistant steel. 
Alternatively, suitable surface treatments may be carried out.
Fretting corrosion
Due to the tin coating applied as standard, fretting corrosion 
between the steel backing of E40 and the housing occurs only rarely. 
In such cases, electroplated protective coatings can be used
to achieve a delaying effect.
Electrochemical contact corrosion
In unfavourable conditions, electrical cells (local elements) can be 
formed that reduce the operating life through corrosion of the steel. 
This should be checked at the design stage and clarified by means
of tests. In case of doubt, please consult the Schaeffler engineering 
service.

Machining of plain bearings
Metal/polymer composite plain bearings can be machined by either 
cutting or non-cutting methods, such as shortening or drilling.
The procedure is as follows:
■Cut the plain bearings starting from the PTFE side, since the burr 
formed in cutting will impair the running surface.
■Clean the bearing elements thoroughly.
■Protect any bright steel surfaces such as cut edges against 
corrosion by means of oil or electroplated protective coatings.
In electroplating with high current densities or or long coating times, 
the sliding layers should be masked to prevent deposits.
The machining temperature must not exceed +280 °C in the case
of the sliding layer E40, otherwise there may be a health risk.
Alternative joining methods
If the press fit of the bush is not sufficient, the bush can be secured 
by additional adhesive bonding.
The running-in or sliding surface must always be kept free
of adhesive.
If adhesive is used, the adhesive manufacturer must always be 
consulted, particularly on the selection of adhesives, preparation of 
the surface, hardening, strength, temperature range and elongation 
behaviour.
Electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity of new bearings may be lower because
the running-in layer is still present. The bronze layer is partially 
exposed after the running-in process, thus improving the electrical 
conductivity, Figure 4, page 294.
The electrical resistance is dependent on the size of the contact 
surface.

Setting the bearing clearance
Metal/polymer composite plain bearings are supplied ready
for mounting. In order to set the tolerance of the bearing clearance, 
measures should be selected at the predimensioning stage that will 
not shorten the life of the bearings, such as closer tolerances
of the housing bore or the shaft.
In a further possibility for setting the bearing clearance, the bushes 
are sized, Figure 7 and table. This should only be carried out
if there is no other way to achieve a reduced tolerance of the bearing 
clearance.
Sizing leads to a significant reduction in the rating life Lh of 
metal/polymer composite plain bearings with the sliding layer E40, 
see table. Precise values for the reduction in rating life can only be 
determined by means of tests.

ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes, 
maintenance-free
Features
ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes are maintenance-free, free from 
corrosion and have low wear and friction. Further advantages
of the filament composite are low mass together with high load 
carrying capacity and resistance to shocks as well as suitability
for applications involving vibrations.
ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes are particularly suitable as
an environmentally-friendly and maintenance-free bearing type
for replacing steel or bronze bearings.
Maintenance-free
plain bearing material
The radial dry plain bearings have a sliding layer made from ELGOTEX® 
and a twin layer structure, Figure 1:
■The outer layer (the backing) ensures the strength of the bush.
It comprises continuous glass fibres that are additionally 
stabilised by means of a specific winding angle, giving
an increase in strength. The fibres are bound in epoxy resin.
■The inner layer (sliding layer) contains a polymer/PTFE yarn that 
is embedded together with fillers and solid lubricants in a resin 
matrix.
Due to the combination of filaments and resin matrix, the bushes
are suited in preference for dry-running applications, see table, 
page 324.
Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The filament wound bushes are non-metallic and thus substantially 
resistant to media. For special environmental conditions, please 
consult the Schaeffler engineering service.

ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes, 
maintenance-free
Technical data for ELGOTEX®
Maintenance-free ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes have
the following mechanical and physical characteristics, see table.
ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes are intended for dry running.
They achieve their maximum operating life under these conditions.
Slight settling of the material occurs during running-in.
In underwater use, there is a considerable reduction in operating 
life. In this case, the coefficient of friction may increase significantly.
In the production of ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes, defects 
(pores) and fraying may occur in the PTFE due to the production 
process. These cannot be prevented by technological measures and 
do not represent any impairment of the function.
Characteristics of ELGOTEX®
1) The maximum permissible bearing load as a function of velocity is determined 
by means of pv diagrams, Figure 2, page 29.
2) For static loads of more than 180 N/mm2, the design of ELGOTEX® filament 
wound bushes must be checked by the Schaeffler engineering service.
For loads at or over this range, we alternatively recommend the use of 
ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes, see page 334.

Sealing
Standard plain bushes without a suffix are not sealed. These can, 
however, be combined with separate external seals in order
to prevent the ingress of contamination and moisture, see section 
Sealing, page 106.
Plain bushes ZWB are available by agreement with integrated 
seals 2RS on both sides or integrated seals RS on one side.
In the design of the sealing arrangement, it must be borne in mind 
that the bearing clearance will increase due to wear of the sliding 
layer, see page 87.
Lubrication
During the running-in phase, PTFE particles are transferred from
the sliding layer to the mating surface. As a result, the small 
roughness features of the shaft surface are filled in. It is only once 
this tribologically smooth surface is produced in conjunction
with the detached PTFE particles that the bearings can achieve a long 
operating life.
Maintenance-free ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes do not have 
relubrication facilities and must not be lubricated.
Any lubrication of maintenance-free ELGOTEX® filament wound 
bushes after running-in will impair the smoothing effect necessary 
and will considerably reduce the operating life of the bearings.
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature for maintenance-free
ELGOTEX® filament wound bushes is between –20 °C and +130 °C.

Design and
safety guidelines
In addition to the design and safety guidelines described here,
the following guidelines in the Technical principles must also be 
observed:
■theoretical bearing clearance of ELGOTEX® filament wound 
bushes, see page 87
■design of bearing arrangements, see page 90
■recommended mounting tolerances, see page 102
■misalignment of plain bushes, see page 103
■pressing in of bushes, see page 120.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving spatial 
motion. Any skewing of the shaft will reduce the operating life.
Friction
The characteristic coefficients of friction, calculation of the bearing 
frictional torque and the typical wear characteristics are given
in the chapter Technical principles, see section Friction and 
increases in temperature, page 69.
Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of plain bushes is summarised in the chapter 
Technical principles, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.

Calculation example
for bush ZWB607060
The rating life of the bush is calculated on the basis of the sliding 
layer ELGOTEX®, see section Load carrying capacity and life, page 35.
Given data
The given data for calculation of the rating life are as follows:
■highly loaded pivots on an angled lever
■steel shaft (hard chromium coating, roughness depth Rz1,6)
■point load (rotating shaft, stationary bush).
Operating parameters
Bearing data
Required
Bearing with the required rating life Lh  15 000 h.
Checking of permissible loads
The validity of the permissible loads and sliding velocities must be 
checked, since useful rating life calculation is only possible within 
this range, see tables, page 50.
Specific bearing load
The specific bearing load must be calculated with the aid of
the specific load parameter K and checked for validity, see table, 
page 41, and table, page 50:
Sliding velocity in swivel motion
The sliding velocity must be calculated with the aid of the inside 
diameter Di and the swivel angle  and checked for validity,
see table, page 44, and table, page 50:
Specific frictional energy pv
The specific frictional energy pv must be checked for validity,
see table, page 50.

ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes,  
maintenance-free
Features
Maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes ZGB are radial dry plain 
bearings and comprise a cylindrical steel backing with a sliding layer 
made from ELGOGLIDE®. The steel backing protects the plain bush 
against damage during handling and mounting.
The plain bushes are available for shaft diameters from 30 mm
to 200 mm. They have low friction and good damping behaviour.
The dimensions conform to DIN ISO 4379, diameter series 2 and 3.
The plain bushes are very easy to mount. They are pressed into
the housing bore and require no further axial location.
Area of application
ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes can support higher forces than conven-
tional plain bushes and can therefore be used to replace replace 
steel, bronze and plastic bearings.
Since they can support very high radial forces with a uniform load 
direction as well as high static loads, they are particularly suitable 
for high alternating loads and swivel motion. They allow some axial 
motion.

ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes,

Maintenance-free
plain bearing material
The material for the support body is steel and the outside diameter 
is precision machined.
The sliding layer comprises a 0,5 mm thick layer of ELGOGLIDE®,
is embedded in synthetic resin and attached by a high strength bond 
to the support body, Figure 1.
The flow behaviour of the sliding layer is, in conjunction with
the support body, almost negligible even under very high load.
The adhesive bond is resistant to moisture and swelling.
ELGOGLIDE® designs
For differing requirements, the following are available:
■ELGOGLIDE®
the standard material for very high dynamic contact pressures 
from 25 N/mm2 to 300 N/mm2 and a long operating life.
■ELGOGLIDE®-W11
the material for dynamic contact pressures from 1 N/mm2
to 100 N/mm2 and with low coefficients of friction even at
low contact pressures.
Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The maintenance-free plain bearing material ELGOGLIDE® is intended 
for dry running.
Application in damp environments
For applications involving contact with water, plain bushes with
a corrosion-resistant steel support body must be used, suffix W1. 
Wear of the sliding layer is considerably increased by the flushing 
effect. The operating life is sufficient in applications with low 
frequency of motion.
The design of the plain bush and its suitability should be agreed
in consultation with Schaeffler.

Technical data for ELGOGLIDE®
Maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes have the following 
mechanical and physical characteristics, see table.
Characteristics
of ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes
1) The static load carrying capacity of ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes is determined
by the steel support body. Plain bushes with a static load carrying capacity
of up to 500 N/mm2 can be achieved by agreement through the use of a higher 
strength material for the steel support body.
Sealing
Standard plain bushes without a suffix are not sealed. These can, 
however, be combined with separate external seals in order
to prevent the ingress of contamination and moisture, see page 106.
Plain bushes ZGB are available by agreement with integrated 
seals 2RS on both sides or integrated seals RS on one side.
In the design of the sealing arrangement, it must be borne in mind 
that the bearing clearance will increase due to wear of the sliding 
layer, see page 89.
Lubrication
During the running-in phase, PTFE particles are transferred from
the sliding layer to the mating surface. As a result, the small 
roughness features of the shaft surface are filled in. It is only once 
this tribologically smooth surface is produced in conjunction
with the detached PTFE particles that the bearings can achieve
a long operating life.
Maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes do not have relubrication 
facilities and must not be lubricated.
Any lubrication of maintenance-free ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes
after running-in will impair the smoothing effect necessary and will 
considerably reduce the operating life of the bearings.

Design and
safety guidelines
In addition to the design and safety guidelines described here,
the following guidelines in the Technical principles must also be 
observed:
■operating clearance of ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes, see page 81
■design of bearing arrangements, see page 90
■recommended mounting tolerances, see page 102
■misalignment of plain bushes, see page 103
■pressing in of bushes, see page 120.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving spatial 
motion. Any skewing of the shaft will reduce the operating life.
Friction
The friction behaviour changes during the operating life. Bearings 
that have been well run in give the lowest coefficients of friction.
During the running-in and failure phases, the values are in some 
cases significantly higher than those of bearings after running-in. 
The characteristic coefficients of friction, calculation of the bearing 
frictional torque and the typical wear characteristics are given
in the chapter Technical principles, see section Friction and 
increases in temperature, page 69.
Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of plain bushes is summarised in the chapter 
Technical principles, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.

Metal/polymer composite plain bushes,

low-maintenance
Features
Maintenance-free plain bushes are used for rotary, oscillating and 
linear motion. These plain bearings are bearings for very small radial 
or axial design envelopes. They are rolled from a cut section of strip 
and have a butt joint over the entire width of the bearing.
If the plain bushes are to be used in the aerospace sector or in
the food or pharmaceuticals industry, please contact the Schaeffler 
engineering service.
Low-maintenance
plain bearing material
For low-maintenance metal/polymer composite plain bearings from 
Schaeffler, the sliding material E50 is used. The basis of the sliding 
layer is polyoxymethylene POM.
In the three-layered material, the steel backing has a sintered porous 
tin/bronze intermediate layer whose pores are filled with the super-
imposed sliding layer, see table and Figure 1.
Sliding and
intermediate layer  E50
Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The resistance of the material E50 depends on the chemical 
characteristics of the individual layers:
■The material E50 is resistant to many greases.
■The tin-plated steel surface gives adequate protection against 
corrosion in most cases.
The material E50 is not resistant to acidic media (pH  5) and 
alkaline media (pH  9).

Metal/polymer composite plain bushes,

Technical data for E50
The sliding layer E50 is a low-maintenance, low-wear material with 
good damping characteristics and long relubrication intervals. It can 
be used for rotary and oscillating motion and for long stroke linear 
motion, is only slightly sensitive to edge loads and is insensitive
to shocks.
Low-maintenance plain bushes are available in the variant E50 with 
the following mechanical and physical characteristics, see table.
Characteristics of E50
Sealing
The plain bearings are not sealed, but can be protected against
the ingress of contamination and moisture by the use of external 
seals, see page 115.
Lubrication
Low-maintenance plain bearing bushes made from E50 have
a lubrication hole and lubrication pockets. The lubrication pockets 
retain the lubricant, which means that an initial lubrication is 
sufficient in most cases.
The operating life increases if relubrication is carried out regularly.
Greases
Low-maintenance plain bushes made from E50 must be lubricated 
using suitable grease or oil.
Lithium soap greases with a mineral oil base are highly suitable.
Grease additives such as molybdenum disulphide, zinc sulphide or 
other solid lubricants are unfavourable since they increase wear. 
Greases may contain max. 5% MoS2.
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature for low-maintenance plain 
bearings is between –40 °C and +110 °C.

Design and
safety guidelines
In addition to the design and safety guidelines described here,
the following guidelines in the Technical principles must also be 
observed:
■theoretical bearing clearance of metal/polymer composite plain 
bushes, see page 81
■design of bearing arrangements, see page 90
■recommended mounting tolerances, see page 102
■misalignment of plain bushes, see page 103, and edge loading
of metal/polymer composite plain bushes, see page 103
■pressing in of bushes, see page 120.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving spatial 
motion. Any skewing of the shaft will reduce the operating life.
Friction
The characteristic coefficients of friction, calculation of the bearing 
frictional torque and the typical wear characteristics are given
in the chapter Technical principles, see section Friction and 
increases in temperature, page 69.
Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of plain bushes is summarised in the chapter 
Technical principles, see section Technical principles, page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or static 
load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life can be calculated if the range of validity is observed, 
see tables, page 50.
Shaft design
The shaft and mating surface of the bearing arrangement must be 
produced in accordance with the following specifications.
Shafts should be chamfered and all sharp edges rounded. This 
allows easier mounting and prevents damage to the sliding layer
of the bush.
Mating surface
The mating surface should always be wider than the bearing
to prevent the formation of steps in the sliding layer.
The optimum operating life of the sliding layer E50 is achieved
with a roughness depth of the mating surface of Rz2 to Rz3.
Very small roughness values do not have a beneficial effect on the 
operating life, but larger roughness values reduce it considerably.

HG 1
Schaeffler Technologies
Metal/polymer composite plain bushes,

low-maintenance
Surface quality
Ground or drawn surfaces are preferable as a mating surface. 
Surfaces that have been precision turned or rolled by precision 
turning, even with Rz2 to Rz3, can cause greater wear since helical 
manufacturing grooves are created by precision turning.
Spheroidal graphite cast iron GGG has an open surface structure and 
should therefore be ground to Rz2 or better.
The direction of rotation of cast shafts in the application should be 
the same as that of the grinding wheel during machining, since 
increased wear should be anticipated if rotation is in the opposing 
direction, Figure 2.
Heat dissipation
Correct and sufficient heat dissipation must be ensured:
■If media-lubricated operation is present, the heat is dissipated 
predominantly via the fluid lubricant.
■In the case of low-maintenance plain bearings, the heat is 
dissipated via the housing and shaft.
Protection against corrosion
Corrosion of the mating surface is prevented by sealing or the use of 
corrosion-resistant steel. Alternatively, suitable surface treatments 
may be carried out. In the case of the sliding layer E50, the lubricant 
gives additional protection against corrosion.
Fretting corrosion
Due to the tin coating applied as standard, fretting corrosion 
between the steel backing of E50 and the housing occurs only rarely. 
In such cases, electroplated protective coatings can be used
to achieve a delaying effect.
Electrochemical contact corrosion
In unfavourable conditions, electrical cells (local elements) can be 
formed that reduce the operating life through corrosion of the steel. 
This should be checked at the design stage and clarified by means
of tests. In case of doubt, please consult the Schaeffler engineering 
service.

Machining of plain bearings
Metal/polymer composite plain bearings can be machined by either 
cutting or non-cutting methods, such as shortening or drilling.
The procedure is as follows:
■Cut the plain bearings starting from the POM side, since the burr 
formed in cutting will impair the running surface.
■Clean the bearing elements thoroughly.
■Protect any bright steel surfaces such as cut edges against 
corrosion by means of oil or electroplated protective coatings.
In electroplating with high current densities or or long coating times, 
the sliding layers should be masked to prevent deposits.
The machining temperature must not exceed +110 °C in the case
of the sliding layer E50.
Alternative joining methods
If the interference fit of the bush is inadequate or if it is unecon-
omical to use dowel pins or screws, there are economical alternative 
methods for location:
■laser welding
■soft soldering
■adhesive bonding.
The temperature of the sliding layer must not exceed +110 °C
in the case of E50.
The running-in or sliding surface must always be kept free
of adhesive.
If adhesive is used, the adhesive manufacturer must always be 
consulted, particularly on the selection of adhesives, preparation of 
the surface, hardening, strength, temperature range and elongation 
behaviour.

Thrust washers, strips
Metal/polymer
composite plain bearings,
maintenance-free
................................................................................................................. 358
Maintenance-free thrust washers are used to support forces in
an axial direction. Strips are used to facilitate linear motion.
Strips are also used as the basic material for individual special 
designs produced in accordance with drawings.
The maintenance-free plain bearing material E40 is, due to the dry 
lubricant polytetrafluorethylene PTFE, intended for dry running. 
These bearings are thus particularly suitable where the bearing 
position must be maintenance-free, there is a risk of lubricant 
starvation or where lubricant is unacceptable or undesirable.
Typical areas of application include automatic assembly machines, 
door hinges, damping elements, electrotechnical installations and 
solar energy plant.
Metal/polymer
composite plain bearings,
low-maintenance
................................................................................................................. 372
Low-maintenance thrust washers and strips support axial forces and 
facilitate rotary or linear motion as in the case of the maintenance-
free variants. Due to the presence of lubrication pockets, however, 
they can be lubricated with oil or grease.
The low-maintenance plain bearing material E50 is a low-wear 
material with good damping characteristics and long relubrication 
intervals. The bearings have a sliding layer made from 
polyoxymethylene POM. 
It is only slightly sensitive to edge loads and is insensitive to shocks.
Application examples can be found in particular in the area of 
production machinery, construction and agricultural equipment
as well as commercial vehicles.

Thrust washers, strips,

maintenance-free
Features
Maintenance-free thrust washers are used for rotary and oscillating 
motion. Strips are used predominantly for linear motion or as
the basic material for other designs, such as half-cups or special 
geometries.
These plain bearings are bearings for very small design envelopes.
The plain bearings are supplied with either steel backing or
bronze backing. Bearings with a bronze backing have high corrosion 
resistance and very good thermal conductivity and are antimagnetic.
If the plain bushes are to be used in the aerospace sector or in
the food or pharmaceuticals industry, please contact the Schaeffler 
engineering service.

Maintenance-free
plain bearing material
For maintenance-free metal/polymer composite plain bearings
from Schaeffler, the sliding material E40 and E40-B is used.
The basis of the dry lubricant is polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE
with embedded chemically non-reactive additives.
In the three-layered material, the steel or bronze backing has
a sintered porous tin/bronze sliding layer whose pores are filled with 
the superimposed running-in layer, see table, Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
The running-in layer is a plastic composite comprising PTFE and 
additives.

Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The resistance of the material E40 depends on the chemical 
characteristics of the individual layers:
■The material E40 is resistant to water, alcohols, glycols and 
numerous mineral and synthetic oils.
■The tin-plated steel surface gives adequate protection against 
corrosion in most cases.
■In the case of the material E40-B, the bronze backing
is additionally resistant to water vapour and seawater.
The material E40 is not resistant to acidic media (pH  5) and 
alkaline media (pH  9). The bronze backing of E40-B is not resistant 
to oxidising acids and gases such as free halides, ammonia or 
hydrogen sulphide, especially if these gases have a high moisture 
content.
Technical data for E40
The sliding layer E40 is maintenance-free. It can be used for rotary 
and oscillating motion as well as for short stroke linear motion.
The low-wear material has good sliding characteristics (no stick-
slip), a low coefficient of friction and high resistance to chemicals.
It does not absorb water (it is highly resistant to swelling),
does not tend to weld to metal and is also suitable for hydrodynamic 
operation.
Maintenance-free thrust washers and strips are available in
the variants E40 and E40-B with the following mechanical and 
physical characteristics, see table.

Lubrication
Plain bearings with the sliding layer E40 contain dry lubricants and 
do not therefore require lubrication.
Lubrication can be used to protect the mating surface against 
corrosion or simply to provide sealing against contamination.
It should be checked in advance, however, whether it is more 
advantageous in such cases to use a corrosion-resistant material
for the mating surface or a different means of sealing the bearing 
position.
In certain applications, the sliding layer E40 can be used in fluid 
media. In this case, the improved heat dissipation may considerably 
increase the operating life.
The compatibility of the media with the sliding layer E40
must be checked. Further advice should therefore be sought from
the Schaeffler engineering service.
Lubricants
Oil and grease lubrication, even in very small quantities, impairs
the transfer of material during the running-in phase.
Over time, grease and small quantities of oil mix with wear debris
to form a paste that promotes wear. Solid lubricants such as
zinc sulphide, molybdenum disulphide or similar grease additives
are not permitted, since they promote this paste formation to
an increased extent.
Relubrication
If it is not possible in exceptional cases to avoid the use of grease 
lubrication, the bearings must be relubricated periodically.
During relubrication, old grease is replaced by fresh grease.
At the same time, the grease flushes wear debris and contaminants 
out of the bearing.
If periodic relubrication is carried out, the formation of paste 
comprising debris and contaminants must be avoided.
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature for maintenance-free 
metal/polymer composite plain bearings is between –200 °C and 
+280 °C.
The running-in layer and sliding layer may undergo swelling in
the presence of some mineral oils at temperatures above +100 °C. 
This could lead to jamming of the bearing.
This can be remedied by increasing the bearing clearance,
since other characteristics of the sliding layer E40 are unaffected.

Design and
safety guidelines
The guidelines on the design of bearing arrangements and
on mounting and dismounting must be observed, see section Design 
of bearing arrangements, page 90.
Friction
At high specific bearing load and low sliding velocity, the coefficient 
of friction is more favourable, see section Friction and increases in 
temperature, page 69.
Running-in process
During the running-in process, part of the running-in layer is 
transferred to the mating surface:
■This compensates uneven areas.
■A mating surface with a low coefficient of friction is formed,
which acts favourably on the operating behaviour.
■After running-in, some of the porous bronze layer is visible on
the sliding layer as individual areas of differing sizes, Figure 3. 
This shows that the bearing is running correctly.
Operating behaviour
After running-in, the wear of maintenance-free plain bearings 
proceeds in a linear manner, Figure 4.

Dimensioning and rating life
The dimensioning of thrust washers and strips is summarised in
the chapter Technical principles, see section Technical principles, 
page 20.
Depending on whether the bearing is subjected to dynamic or
static load, the following must be checked:
■static load safety factor S0
■maximum permissible specific bearing load p
■maximum permissible sliding velocity v
■maximum specific frictional energy pv.
The rating life of thrust washers can be calculated if the range
of validity is observed, see tables, page 50.
For a rating life estimate in the case of strips EGS, the Schaeffler 
engineering service should be contacted.
Design
of the adjacent construction
The adjacent construction should be chamfered and all sharp
edges should be rounded. This allows easier mounting and prevents 
damage to the sliding layer.
Mating surface
The mating surface should always be wider than the bearing
to prevent the formation of steps in the sliding layer.
The optimum operating life in dry running of the sliding layer E40 is 
achieved with a roughness depth of the mating surface of Rz2 to Rz3.
Very small roughness values do not have a beneficial effect on the 
operating life, but larger roughness values reduce it considerably.
Surface quality
Ground or drawn surfaces are preferable as a mating surface. 
Surfaces that have been precision turned or rolled by precision 
turning, even with Rz2 to Rz3, can cause greater wear since helical 
manufacturing grooves are created by precision turning.
Spheroidal graphite cast iron GGG has an open surface structure and 
should therefore be ground to Rz2 or better, Figure 6, page 300.
Heat dissipation
Correct and sufficient heat dissipation must be ensured:
■If hydrodynamic operation is present,
the heat is dissipated predominantly via the fluid lubricant.
■In the case of maintenance-free plain bearings,
the heat is dissipated via the housing and shaft.

Protection against corrosion
Corrosion of the mating surface in the case of the sliding layer E40
is prevented by sealing or the use of corrosion-resistant steel. 
Alternatively, suitable surface treatments may be carried out.
Fretting corrosion
Due to the tin coating applied as standard, fretting corrosion 
between the steel backing of E40 and the housing occurs only rarely. 
In such cases, electroplated protective coatings can be used to 
achieve a delaying effect.
Electrochemical contact corrosion
In unfavourable conditions, electrical cells (local elements) can be 
formed that reduce the operating life through corrosion of the steel. 
This should be checked at the design stage and clarified by means
of tests. In case of doubt, please consult the Schaeffler engineering 
service.
Machining of plain bearings
Metal/polymer composite plain bearings can be machined by either 
cutting or non-cutting methods, such as turning, shearing, drilling or 
bending.
The procedure is as follows:
■Cut the sliding layer starting from the PTFE side, since the burr 
formed in cutting will impair the running surface.
■Clean the bearing elements thoroughly.
■Protect any bright steel surfaces such as cut edges against 
corrosion by means of oil or electroplated protective coatings.
In electroplating with high current densities or long coating times, 
the sliding layers should be masked to prevent deposits.
The machining temperature must not exceed +280 °C in the case
of the sliding layer E40, otherwise there may be a health risk.
Alternative joining methods
If it is uneconomical to use dowel pins or screws,
there are economical alternative methods for location:
■laser welding
■soft soldering
■adhesive bonding.
The temperature of the running-in layer or sliding layer must not 
exceed +280 °C in the case of E40.
The running-in or sliding layer must always be kept free of adhesive.
If adhesive is used, the adhesive manufacturer must always be 
consulted, particularly on the selection of adhesives, preparation
of the surface, hardening, strength, temperature range and 
elongation behaviour.
Electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity of new bearings may be lower because
the running-in layer is still present. The bronze layer is partially 
exposed after the running-in process, thus improving the electrical 
conductivity, Figure 3, page 365.
The electrical resistance is dependent on the size of the contact 
surface.

Features
Low-maintenance thrust washers are used for rotary and oscillating 
motion. Strips are used predominantly for linear motion or as
the basic material for other designs, such as half-cups or special 
geometries.
These plain bearings are bearings for very small design envelopes.
If the plain bushes are to be used in the aerospace sector or in
the food or pharmaceuticals industry, please contact the Schaeffler 
engineering service.
Low-maintenance
plain bearing material
For low-maintenance metal/polymer composite plain bearings from 
Schaeffler, the sliding material E50 is used. The basis of the sliding 
layer is polyoxymethylene POM.
In the three-layered material, the steel backing has a sintered
porous tin/bronze intermediate layer whose pores are filled with
the superimposed sliding layer, see table and Figure 1.

Resistance
of the plain bearing material
The resistance of the material E50 depends on the chemical 
characteristics of the individual layers:
■The material E50 is resistant to many greases.
■The tin-plated steel surface of thrust washers is adequate 
protection against corrosion in most cases.
The material E50 is not resistant to acidic media (pH  5) and 
alkaline media (pH  9).
Technical data for E50
The sliding layer E50 is a low-maintenance, low-wear material
with good damping characteristics and long relubrication intervals.
It can be used for rotary and oscillating motion and for long stroke 
linear motion, is only slightly sensitive to edge loads and
is insensitive to shocks.
Low-maintenance thrust washers and strips are available in
the variant E50 with the following mechanical and physical 
characteristics, see table.

Lubrication
Low-maintenance thrust washers and strips made from E50 have 
lubrication pockets. The lubrication pockets retain the lubricant, 
which means that an initial lubrication is sufficient in most cases.
The operating life increases if relubrication is carried out regularly.
Greases
Low-maintenance plain bearings made from E50 must be lubricated 
using suitable grease or oil.
Lithium soap greases with a mineral oil base are highly suitable.
Grease additives such as molybdenum disulphide, zinc sulphide or 
other solid lubricants are unfavourable since they increase wear. 
Greases may contain max. 5% MoS2.
Operating temperature
The permissible operating temperature for low-maintenance
plain bearings is between –40 °C and +110 °C.

Special materials
Features
By agreement, Schaeffler can supply plain bearings in materials 
other than those stated in the product descriptions. These have 
differing characteristics and areas of application.
In the case of spherical plain bearings, Schaeffler offers a glass fibre 
reinforced plastic as a sliding material, in the case of metal/polymer 
composite plain bearings the maintenance-free special material 
E421 or the plain bearing material E60 for film bearings.
These maintenance-free special materials conform to the regulations 
for lead-free plain bearings as stated in the Technical Principles.
Glass fibre reinforced plastic
A glass fibre reinforced plastic plate GFK with additives of PTFE
offers a sliding layer with a very long operating life, for example
for the large spherical plain bearing GE..-DF, Figure 1.
Due to the larger sliding layer thickness, this bearing offers a longer 
wear life compared to bearings with other sliding materials.
The sliding material can be lubricated and is suitable for low as well 
as high sliding velocities. The operating life can be increased even 
further by initial lubrication and occasional relubrication.
Examples of applications include ladle turrets or mills, since greater 
clearance is permissible here and loads tend to act in one direction 
only.

Plain bearing material E60
for film bearings
E60 is the new plain bearing material from Schaeffler for 
maintenance-free film bearings. The metal/polymer composite 
comprises a bronze rib mesh that is filled with a dry lubricant
made from polytetrafluorethylene PTFE with embedded chemically 
non-reactive additives.

 Bush/pin system
with ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes
In the case of ready-to-fit bush/pin systems with a clamping device, 
the raceway of the pin is already integrated, Figure 3. The raceway 
and the sliding material are matched to each other to form a unit that 
fulfils the required specifications.
The system with the integrated ELGOGLIDE® plain bushes can replace 
steel or bronze bushes with a relubrication facility.
These units are pressed into housings and frames and require no 
additional means of axial location.
Due to the very high compressive strength of the ELGOGLIDE® sliding 
material, it can easily withstand shock loads as well as static
and dynamic alternating loads. Application possibilities include 
articulated loaders.

Spherical plain bearings
Special designs of spherical plain bearings are products for specific 
bearing arrangement problems and are manufactured exclusively
for specific customers or orders. The products presented here are 
examples taken from a large number of such developments.
Locating bearings for articulated
frame steering systems
These bearings are used as locating bearings in articulated frame 
steering systems for construction machinery and have a high radial 
and axial load carrying capacity. They have sliding zones of a special 
geometrical design, Figure 7.
This prevents edge stresses in the part of the bearing under axial 
load. Since the bearings are supplied preadjusted and ready
for mounting, there is no need for clearance setting by the customer.
Prop shaft centring bearings
These bearings are centring elements capable of cardanic type 
motion and are used for the damping of vibrations in rear and four 
wheel drive vehicles in the centre of the coupling between
the gearbox and prop shaft, Figure 8. They support the prop shaft 
mass on the coupling, thus preventing eccentricity of the elastically 
coupled shafts. A lamellar ring made from spring steel sets the 
internal clearance of the bearing automatically to zero, so the unit is 
permanently free from clearance.

Spherical plain bearings
for clearance-free bearing
arrangements
This design has a steel/plastic sliding contact surface and is used
in clearance-free bearing arrangements such as gear levers, 
Figure 11.
The preloaded rubber elements allow compensation of the effects
of wear up to 0,4 mm. As a result, the bearings can exhibit preload 
values comparable to those of a new bearing even after a long 
operating life. After initial greasing, they are maintenance-free
for the entire operating life.
Gear lever bearing arrangements
Gear lever bearing arrangements are developed to meet the specific 
requirements of the vehicle manufacturer, Figure 12:
■continuous compensation of operating clearance
■constant tilting moment
■maintenance-free throughout the life of the vehicle
■suitable for combination with noise and vibration damping 
measures.

Spherical plain bearings
with bellows
The special spherical plain bearing has a particularly large motion 
angle, with a swivel angle of  = 20° and a tilt angle of  = 19°. 
In addition, the bearing is sealed by means of bellows, Figure 13.
In comprehensive tests, reliability in terms of rating life, maximum 
swivel and tilt angle, seal integrity and resistance to media was 
successfully demonstrated.
The bearing is located in the adjacent construction by means of snap 
rings and spacer sleeves and contributes to cost reduction due to its 
ease of mounting and dismounting.

Central joint bearings
The central joint bearing is used to connect two carriage bodies
of rail vehicles and must support not only static but also dynamic 
loads occurring in operation, Figure 14. It facilitates all necessary 
turning, tilting and pitching motions that occur when travelling
on curved tracks, through cuttings or where these are caused by
the nature of the track.
The central joint bearing is based on a radial spherical plain bearing 
that was developed with an integral anti-lift system. The bearing
is easy to mount and is screw mounted to the upper and lower 
housings. Due to its compact, low-section design, it can be used
in low-floor vehicles as well as in other types of rail vehicle.
The bearing system is protected effectively against contamination
by means of integrated seals. The inner and outer ring have special 
coatings in order to give very good protection against corrosion.

For the tip/tilt cylinder pivot on fork lift trucks, special rod ends are 
necessary that can support high loads despite their small design

In order to support the loads, the special rod ends are forged from 
high strength material. They are easy to mount and maintain.
The moving part is fixed to the rod end by means of cap head screws.

Thermal tools
Induction heating devices HEATER with mains frequency technology 
are used to heat plain bearings and other components with a cylin-
drical bore where a tight fit on the shaft or in the housing is intended.
Adequate expansion of the bearings is achieved in most cases at 
+80 °C to +100 °C. During the heating operation, the maximum 
heating temperature must be observed. In the case of plain bearings, 
the temperature may not normally exceed +130 °C, in order to avoid 
damage to the seals. In all devices for heating, the temperature can 
be steplessly controlled.
Wear protective gloves during mounting and dismounting of heated 
parts.
Induction heating devices HEATER
The induction heating devices HEATER for spherical plain bearings 
up to a mass of 1200 kg have been improved further in terms
of their performance capability and safety compared with their 
predecessors. They can also be used to heat sealed and greased 
spherical plain bearings. In addition to the tabletop devices 
HEATER10 to HEATER300, the range also includes the standalone 
devices HEATER600 and HEATER1200 for larger bearings. 
HEATER300 can also be converted to a mobile unit by means of 
accessories.
The scope of delivery of the induction heating devices HEATER covers 
a basic setup for the initial applications, Figure 2.
The spherical plain bearing to be heated is either placed horizontally 
on the support rails or is suspended on the ledge.

Induction units
with medium frequency technology
The heating device with medium frequency technology gives rapid, 
simple and effective heating of medium-sized to large spherical 
plain bearings and similar steel parts for mounting and dismounting. 
The device always comprises two parts: an inductor and a generator.
The inductor can be of a flexible or rigid design. The rigid design
is particularly suitable for batch applications. The flexible design
of inductor can be wound around the components.
Each device is designed for the specific application and is fitted, 
depending on the workpiece, with flexible or rigid inductors.
Due to its compact construction, the device can also be used
for mobile operation. The device can therefore be moved to
the location of the workpiece. It can therefore be used, for example, 
at construction sites for wind turbines or for other large components 
that are difficult to transport.
Advantages
The advantages of the heating device with medium frequency 
technology are as follows:
■suitable for mounting
■suitable for dismounting
■operating frequency from 10 kHz to 25 kHz
■efficiency of the generator higher than 90%
■low energy requirements
■short heating times
■control of heating according to time and temperature
■automatic demagnetisation
■flexible and fixed inductors available
■suitable for use either inside or outside component
■lower mains connection power than heating devices with mains 
frequency
■almost silent
■air-cooled system.

Mounting
Hydraulic tools
Hydraulic tools can be used to apply large forces. These tools are 
therefore particularly suitable for the mounting and dismounting
of large bearings or parts with a tapered bore.
Hydraulic nuts are used as a mounting tool. Pressure can be 
generated using oil injectors, hand pumps or hydraulic units.
Hydraulic nuts
Hydraulic nuts HYDNUT, see table, are used to press components 
with a tapered bore onto their tapered seat. Presses are mainly
used if the drive-up forces required cannot be applied using other 
accessories, e.g. shaft nuts or pressure screws.
The main area of application is:
■the mounting and dismounting of spherical plain bearings
with a tapered bore.
Spherical plain bearings are available by agreement with
a tapered bore. The bearings can be seated directly on a tapered 
shaft, an adapter sleeve or a withdrawal sleeve. The hydraulic nut 
can also be used for the dismounting of adapter or withdrawal 
sleeves.
Available hydraulic nuts

Pump for drive-up distance
The hand pump PUMP1000-4L-CONTROL is particularly suitable as
a pressure generation device where special spherical plain bearings 
are to be driven onto their tapered seat using a hydraulic nut, 
Figure 3.
First, the bearing is driven smoothly onto the tapered seat as far as 
the initial position. A suitable hydraulic nut is then screwed onto
the shaft and the hand pump is connected. The hand pump is then 
operated until the pressure to reach the start position is achieved. 
The pump is then operated further to drive the bearing by the 
required drive-up distance and thus achieve the final position.
The user manual for the pump PUMP1000-4L-CONTROL contains
a table that shows the number of strokes necessary to achieve
the required drive-up distance of the bearing. The required drive-up 
distance is calculated using the software Mounting Manager.

Lubrication
Features
In more than half of all cases, inadequate lubrication is the cause
of unplanned machine downtime. The life of machine elements 
undergoing swivel, rotary or linear motion can be significantly 
extended by the use of greases appropriate to the different operating 
and environmental conditions as well as the definition of and 
adherence to lubrication intervals and quantities.
Services
Services relating to lubrication include:
■the selection of lubricants and lubrication systems
■the preparation of lubrication and maintenance plans
■lubrication point management
■consultancy on lubricants
■lubricant investigations and tests.
Advantages
The Schaeffler lubrication service helps to:
■prevent failures involving components undergoing swivel,
rotary or linear motion
■achieve increases in productivity
■reduce lubrication costs.
Lubricants
An extensive selection of high quality Arcanol rolling bearing
greases is available. In case of doubt, please consult the Schaeffler 
engineering service.
Lubrication devices
Lubricators and lubrication systems automatically provide bearings 
with the correct quantity of lubricant. For manual relubrication, 
grease guns are suitable.
Lever grease gun
The lever grease gun, see table, can be used to manually relubricate 
rod ends requiring maintenance via lubrication nipples.
The container on the lever grease gun can be filled with 500 g
loose grease or by means of a 400 g cartridge. The cartridge must 
correspond to DIN 1284 (diameter 53,5 mm, length 235 mm).
The lever grease gun is connected to the lubrication nipple via
a reinforced hose. The reinforced hose must be ordered separately, 
see table.

Condition Monitoring
Features
The malfunction-free and optimised operation of complex machinery 
and plant can only be achieved by means of condition-based 
maintenance. Schaeffler uses vibration diagnosis as a preferred 
method here.
This method makes it possible to detect damage in machinery at
a very early stage. This means that, for example, damaged compo-
nents can be replaced as part of planned downtime. Unscheduled 
downtime is avoided.
Depending on the type of machine and its importance for the 
production process, condition monitoring can be carried out
by means of either continuous (online) monitoring or regular (offline) 
monitoring.
Continuous monitoring
For production-critical machinery, continuous monitoring, Figure 1, 
by means of vibration diagnosis is indispensable in many cases.
In addition to giving advice on selecting the right system, Schaeffler 
also implements monitoring of the machine. This includes not
only hardware selection but also system configuration and, where 
necessary, its integration into existing systems.
The customer can decide whether to carry out plant monitoring 
himself or to enlist the services of Schaeffler for online monitoring. 
Due to the communication options of the monitoring systems, 
remote analysis can be carried out by the Schaeffler experts.

Condition Monitoring
Regular monitoring
The failure of so-called “B” or “C” category plant items not does
lead directly to downtime and does not therefore lead to expensive 
secondary damage. In the case of such machine parts, regular 
monitoring is generally recommended as a more economical option.
In this type of monitoring, machinery is examined and assessed
by vibration analysis at regular intervals, for example every four 
weeks. This regularity gives more in-depth knowledge of the normal 
condition of the machine. Deviations can thus be detected.
For the monitoring concept, the selection of measurement points 
and monitoring accessories as well as the measurement interval
play a decisive role. If deviations occur during measurement or
if trends are to be investigated, the data can be sent to the Schaeffler 
Diagnosis Centre. Vibration experts will then analyse the data
and prepare a diagnosis report. Through working with the Schaeffler 
experts, customers can build up their own know-how in analysis.
If no personnel are available for data logging, Schaeffler can also 
offer support in data logging. The Company’s experts can carry out 
regular measurements on site.
Troubleshooting
Where malfunctions occur on a machine, defects must be detected 
and rectified very quickly. Based on many years of experience with 
different sectors and applications, the Schaeffler diagnosis experts 
are well versed in such troubleshooting tasks.
Problems or malfunctions in machine operation often become 
apparent through changes in vibration behaviour, unusual tem-
perature patterns or similar phenomena. The investigation is closed-
out by a handover discussion between the diagnosis experts and
all relevant employees on site. In addition to the results of the 
investigation, the recommended countermeasures are discussed
in particular.

Wear measurement system
In order to facilitate condition monitoring for plain bearings as well, 
Schaeffler has developed a special measurement method.
Several sensors distributed around the circumference allow 
continuous monitoring of the wear state and the temperature
in the bearing, Figure 2.
In order to measure the depth of wear on a sliding layer in a 
maintenance-free spherical plain bearing, inductive sensors can
be used. The data can be used, for example, to assist in calculating 
when the sliding layer will come to the end of its life. As a result, 
service intervals can be planned for reconditioning of the bearing.
The wear measurement system is available by agreement for large 
spherical plain bearings. These special bearings must be matched 
and calibrated specifically to the relevant application. In this case, 
please consult the Schaeffler engineering service.

Reconditioning
Features
Many bearings are replaced completely in the course of maintenance 
work although they could be restored to almost as-new condition by 
means of reconditioning. In the case of maintenance-free spherical 
plain bearings with ELGOGLIDE®, this may represent an economically 
attractive alternative, Figure 1.
Advantages
The advantages for the customer are as follows:
■longer useful life due to high quality maintenance work
■short downtime periods due to swift implementation
of the maintenance process
■little mounting work, since the bearings are returned
in a condition ready for mounting
■reduced maintenance costs due to preventive maintenance.
Reconditioning level
Before reconditioning, the bearing is dismounted, cleaned and 
examined. The processing steps required are established and
a proposal is prepared. The scope of reconditioning of plain bearings 
is subdivided into levels, see table.
