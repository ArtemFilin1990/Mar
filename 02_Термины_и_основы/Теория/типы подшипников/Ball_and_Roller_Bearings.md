NTN “Ball and Roller Bearings Catalog”
Issue of CAT.No.2203/E
A rolling bearing is an important mechanical element that is used in various machines. 
Rolling bearings are required to have a long operating life, be small/lightweight, fast, and 
support special environments. Thus, the performance requirements are becoming more 
sophisticated and diversified. In particular, technology for enhancing the performance 
of bearing has been required in recent years. To meet these needs, NTN is performing 
research and development to enhance the performance of the entire machines.
The new general catalog has been entirely revised and edited so that the bearings 
of an optimum type and size can be provided based on the technical contents that are 
supported by the result of development and improvement.
The main revisions of the catalog are as follows.
○ The latest revision of ISO and JIS is reflected, and the pages of general commentaries 
such as bearing selection, bearing periphery design, and handling are largely 
increased.
○ Based on the results of in-house durability testing that has been accumulated 
over a long time, it has been confirmed that the bearing operating life is longer 
then previously published. Thanks to the continuous improvement of the material, 
product, and production techniques, the basic dynamic load ratings were revised 
based on the current bearing operating life data.
○ We are developing and expanding “ULTAGE,” a new generation, all-world class rolling 
bearing series. This catalog introduces the ULTAGE series, which has been developed 
by NTN so far, and includes line-ups that are ready to be manufactured.
We would like you to use the “Ball and Roller Bearings Catalog” which has been revised, 
and we would like to work and develop with customers “to realize a smooth society”. We 
hope to receive your continued patronage and support in the future.
Special bearings for each industry and application type are introduced in special 
sections at the end of the catalog. Please contact NTN Engineering for more information. 
According to the basic policy of NTN corporation, we do not export products or techniques 
that are regulated by foreign exchange rates or that violate foreign trade laws. For 
classification of products specified in this catalog, please contact our branch business 
offices.
　In addition, the accuracy of this catalog has been confirmed; however, please note that 
we do not take any responsibility or liability for any erroneous descriptions or omissions.

1.1  Structure
Most rolling bearings consist of rings with a 
raceway (inner ring and outer ring), rolling 
elements (either balls or rollers) and a cage 
as shown in Fig. 1.1 (Figs. A to H). The cage 
separates the rolling elements at regular 
intervals, holds them in place within the inner 
and outer raceways, and allows them to rotate 
freely.
Raceway (inner ring and outer ring) or 
raceway washer1) (shaft or housing)
The surface on which rolling elements roll is 
called the “raceway surface.” The load placed on 
the bearing is supported by this contact surface.
Generally the inner ring fits on the axle or 
shaft and the outer ring in the housing.
Note 1: The raceway of thrust bearings is called the 
“raceway washer,” the inner ring is called the “shaft 
raceway washer” and the outer ring is called the 
“housing raceway washer.”
Rolling elements
Rolling elements are classified into two types: 
balls and rollers. Rollers come in four types: 
cylindrical, needle, tapered, and spherical. 
Balls geometrically contact with the raceway 
surfaces of the inner and outer rings at “points”, 
while the contact surface of rollers is a “line” 
contact. Theoretically, rolling bearings are 
constructed to allow the rolling elements to 
rotate orbitally while also rotating on their own 
axes at the same time.
Cage
Cages function to maintain rolling elements 
at a uniform pitch so a load is never applied 
directly to the cage and to prevent the rolling 
elements from falling out when handling the 
bearing. Types of cages differ according to 
the way they are manufactured and include: 
pressed, machined and formed cages.
1.2  Classification
Rolling bearings are divided into two main 
classifications: ball bearings and roller 
bearings. Ball bearings are classified according 
to their bearing ring configurations: deep 
groove type and angular contact type. Roller 
bearings on the other hand are classified 
according to the shape of the rollers: cylindrical, 
needle, tapered and spherical. Rolling bearings 
can be further classified according to the 
direction in which the load is applied; radial 
bearings carry radial loads and thrust bearings 
carry axial loads. Other classification methods 
include: 1) number of rolling rows (single, 
double, or 4-row), 2) separable and non-
separable, in which either the inner ring or the 
outer ring can be detached.
There are also bearings designed for 
special applications, such as: precision rolling 
bearings for machine tools, bearings for special 
environments, as well as linear motion bearings 
(linear ball bearings, linear roller bearings 
and linear flat roller bearings). Types of rolling 
bearings are given in Fig. 1.2. For more detailed 
information, please refer to the page that 
introduces each bearing.

1.3  Characteristics
1.3.1  Characteristics of rolling bearings
Rolling bearings come in many shapes and 
varieties, each with its own distinctive features. 
However, when compared with sliding 
bearings, rolling bearings all have the following 
advantages:
(1) The starting friction coefficient is lower and 
there is little difference between this and the 
dynamic friction coefficient.
(2) They are internationally standardized, 
interchangeable and readily obtainable.
(3) They are easy to lubricate and consume less 
lubricant.
(4) As a general rule, one bearing can carry both 
radial and axial loads at the same time.
(5) May be used in either high or low 
temperature applications.
(6) Bearing rigidity can be improved by 
preloading.
Construction, classes, and special features 
of rolling bearings are fully described in the 
boundary dimensions and bearing numbering 
system section.

Characteristics
Load capacity
Because of linear 
contact, rotational 
torque is higher for roller 
bearings than for ball 
bearings, but rigidity is 
also higher.
Linear contact
Contact surface is 
generally rectangular 
when a load is applied.
Because of point 
contact, where there is 
little rolling resistance, 
ball bearings are 
suitable for low torque 
and high-speed 
applications. 
They also have 
superior acoustic 
characteristics.
Load capacity is higher 
for rolling bearings. 
Cylindrical roller 
bearings equipped with 
a lip can bear slight axial 
loads. Combining 
tapered roller bearings 
in pairs enables the 
bearings to bear an axial 
load in both directions.
Load capacity is lower 
for ball bearings, but 
radial bearings are 
capable of bearing 
loads in both the radial 
and axial direction.

1.3.2  Ball bearings and roller bearings
Table 1.1 gives a comparison of ball bearings 
and roller bearings.
1.3.3  Contact angle and bearing type
A contact angle is an angle made by a line that 
connects the contact point of the inner ring, 
rolling element, and outer ring in the radial 
direction when a load is applied on the bearing 
(Fig. 1.3).
Bearings with a contact angle of 45° or less 
have a much greater radial load capacity and are 
classed as radial bearings; whereas bearings 
which have a contact angle over 45° have a 
greater axial load capacity and are classed 
as thrust bearings. There are also bearings 
classed as complex bearings which combine the 
loading characteristics of both radial and thrust 
bearings.
1.3.4  Load acting on bearing
Types of loads applied on rolling bearings are 
given in Fig. 1.4. A moment load is caused by an 
unbalanced load and misalignment.
1.3.5  Standard bearings and special bearings
The boundary dimensions and shapes of 
bearings conforming to international standards 
are interchangeable and can be obtained 
easily and economically all over the world. 
It is therefore better to design mechanical 
equipment that can use standard bearings.
However, depending on the type of 
machine they are to be used in, and the 
expected application and function, a non-
standard or specially designed bearing may 
be best. Bearings that are adapted to specific 
applications, and “unit bearings” which 
are integrated (built-in) into a machine's 
components, and other specially designed 
bearings are also available.
The features of typical standard bearings are 
as follows:
The most common type of bearing, deep groove 
ball bearings are widely used in a variety of 
fields. Deep groove ball bearings can include 
shielded bearings or sealed bearings with grease 
to make them easier to use.
Deep groove ball bearings also include 
bearings with a locating snap-ring to facilitate 
positioning when mounting the outer ring, 
expansion compensating bearings which absorb 
dimension variation of the bearing fitting surface 
due to housing temperature, and TAB bearings 
that are able to withstand contamination in the 
lubricating oil.

The line that unites the point of contact of the 
inner ring, ball and outer ring runs at a certain 
angle (contact angle) in the radial direction.
Angular contact ball bearings are generally 
designed with three contact angles. (Refer to 
Table 1.3)
Angular contact ball bearings can support an 
axial load, but cannot be used by themselves 
because of the contact angle. They must instead 
be used in pairs or in combination. (Refer to 
Table 1.5)
Angular contact ball bearings include double 
row angular contact ball bearings for which the 
inner and outer rings are combined as a single 
unit. (Refer to Table 1.4) The contact angle of 
double row angular contact ball bearings is 25°.
There are also four-point contact bearings 
that can support an axial load in both directions 
by themselves. These bearings however require 
caution because problems such as excessive 
temperature rise and wear could occur 
depending on the load conditions.

contact ball bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings use rollers for rolling 
elements, and therefore have a high load 
capacity. The rollers are guided by the ribs of the 
inner or outer ring. The inner and outer rings can 
be separated to facilitate assembly, and both 
can be fit with a shaft or housing tightly. If there 
are no ribs, either the inner or the outer ring can 
move freely in the axial direction. Cylindrical 
roller bearings are therefore ideal to be used as 
so-called “free side bearings” that absorb shaft 
expansion. In the case where there are ribs, the 
bearing can bear a slight axial load between the 
end of the rollers and the ribs. Cylindrical roller 
bearings include the HT type which modifies 
the shape of the roller end face and ribs for 
increasing axial load capacity, and the EA type 
and E type with a special internal design for 
enhancing radial load capacity. The EA type is 
standardized for small-diameter sizes.
Table 1.6 shows the basic shapes.
In addition to these, there are cylindrical roller 
bearings with multiple rows of rollers and the SL 
type of full complement roller bearings without 
a cage.
Tapered roller bearings are designed so the 
inner/outer ring raceway and apex of the tapered 
rollers intersect at one point on the bearing 
centerline. By receiving a combined load from 
the inner and outer ring, the rollers are pushed 
against the inner ring rib and are guided by the 
rib.
Induced force is produced in the axial 
direction when a radial load is applied, so it must 
be handled with a pair of bearings. The inner 
ring with rollers and outer ring come apart, thus 
facilitating mounting with clearance or preload. 
Assembled clearance is however hard to 
manage and requires special attention. Tapered 
roller bearings are capable of supporting large 
loads in both the axial and radial directions.
NTN also has a line of case hardened steel 
bearings designed for longer life (ETA-, etc.). 
NTN tapered roller bearings also include 
bearings with two and four rows of tapered 
rollers for extra-heavy loads.

There are many types of thrust bearings that 
differ according to the shape of the rolling 
element and application.
Allowable rotational speed is generally 
low and special attention must be paid to 
lubrication.
In addition to the types shown in Table 1.8 
below, there are various other types of thrust 
bearings for special applications.
Needle roller bearings use needle rollers as 
rolling elements. The needle rollers are a 
maximum of 6 mm in diameter and are 3 to 10 
times as long as they are in diameter (JIS B1506 
rolling bearings roller). Because the bearings 
use needle rollers as rolling elements, the 
cross-section is thin, but they have a high load 
capacity for their size. Due to the large number 
of rolling elements, bearings have high rigidity 
and are ideally suited to oscillating motion.
There are various types of needle roller 
bearings, and just a few of the most 
representative types are covered here. For 
details, see the catalog “Needle roller bearings 
(CAT. No. 2300/E).”
A unit comprised of a ball bearing inserted into 
various types of housings. The housing can be 
bolted onto machinery and the inner ring can be 
easily mounted on the shaft with a set screw.
This means the bearing unit can support 
rotating equipment without a special design to 
allow for mounting. A variety of standardized 
housing shapes are available, including pillow 
block and flange types. The outer diameter 
of the bearing is spherical just like the inner 
diameter of the housing, so it is capable of 
aligning itself on the shaft.
For lubrication, grease is filled inside the 
bearing, and foreign particles are prevented 
from entering with a shaft riding seal and slinger 
shield.
For details, see the catalog “Bearing unit 
(CAT. No. 2400/E).”
Spherical roller bearing

ULTAGE
EA type
EM type
213 type
Structure
Equipped with an outer ring with a spherical 
raceway surface and an inner ring which holds 
two rows of barrel-shaped rolling elements, 
NTN spherical roller bearings are able to adjust 
center alignment to handle inclination of the 
axle or shaft.
There are a variety of spherical roller bearing 
types that differ according to their internal 
design.
In addition to cylindrical bore inner rings, 
spherical roller bearings can be produced with 
a tapered bore inner ring. The tapered bore 
bearing can easily be mounted on a shaft by 
means of an adapter or withdrawal sleeve. 
The bearing is capable of supporting heavy 
loads, and is therefore often used for industrial 
machinery. When a heavy axial load is applied 
to the bearing, the load on rollers of one row is 
not applied, and can cause problems. Attention 
must therefore be paid to operating conditions.

(1) Dimensional limitations
There is a wide range of standardized bearing 
types and dimensions. Typically, for bearing used 
in machines, it is necessary to select the optimal 
bearing type and dimension that fits the space 
allowed in the machine.
(2) Bearing load
There can be various directions, characteristics, 
and magnitudes of loading that act on bearings.
However, in determining the appropriate bearing 
type, it is also necessary to consider whether 
the acting load is a radial load only or combined 
radial and axial load. In addition, it is necessary 
to determine what bearing type and size is 
appropriate based on the basic load rating, 
specified in the bearing dimension table, while
considering the magnitude of the load being 
applied.
(3) Rotational speed
The allowable speed of a bearing will differ 
depending upon bearing type, size, tolerances, 
cage type, load, lubricating conditions, and 
cooling conditions.
The allowable speeds listed in the bearing 
tables for grease and oil lubrication are for 
normal tolerance NTN bearings. In general, 
deep groove ball bearings, angular contact ball 
bearings, and cylindrical roller bearings are most 
suitable for high speed applications.
(4) Bearing tolerances
The dimensional accuracy and operating 
tolerances of bearings are regulated by ISO and 
JIS standards.
For equipment requiring high tolerance shaft 
runout or high speed operation, bearings with 
Class 5 tolerance or higher are recommended.
Deep groove ball bearings, angular contact 
ball bearings, and cylindrical roller bearings are 
recommended for high rotational tolerances.
(5) Rigidity
Elastic deformation occurs along the contact 
surfaces of a bearing’s rolling elements and 
raceway surfaces under loading. With certain 
types of equipment it is necessary to reduce this 
deformation as much as possible. In general, 
roller bearings exhibit less elastic deformation 
Fig. 2.1
2.1  Bearing selection flow chart
than ball bearings. Furthermore, in some cases, 
bearings are given a load in advance (preloaded) 
to increase their rigidity. This procedure is 
commonly applied to deep groove ball bearings, 
angular contact ball bearings, and tapered roller 
bearings.
(6) Misalignment of inner and outer rings
Shaft flexure, variations in shaft or housing 
accuracy, and fitting errors result in a certain 
degree of misalignment between the bearing’s 
inner and outer rings. In situations where the 
degree of misalignment is liable to be relatively 
large, self-aligning ball bearings, spherical roller 
bearings, bearing units and other bearings with 
aligning properties are advisable.(Refer to Fig. 2.1)
(7) Noise and torque levels
Rolling bearings are manufactured and processed 
according to high precision standards, and 
therefore generally produce only slight amounts 
of noise and torque. For applications requiring 
particularly low-noise or low-torque operation, 
deep groove ball bearings and cylindrical roller 
bearings are most appropriate.
(8) Installation and disassembly
Some applications require frequent disassembly 
and reassembly to enable periodic inspections 
and repairs. For such applications, bearings with 
separable inner/outer rings, such as cylindrical 
roller bearings, needle roller bearings, and 
tapered roller bearings are most appropriate. 
Incorporation of adapter sleeves simplifies the 
installation and disassembly of self-aligning 
ball bearings and spherical roller bearings with 
tapered bores.
2.  Bearing selection
An example of the procedure for selecting bearings is shown in the following flow chart. When special 
consideration is necessary, consult with NTN Engineering.
NTN provides rolling bearings (hereinafter referred to as bearings) of various types and dimensions. 
When selecting the correct bearing for your application, it is important to consider several factors, and 
analyze using various means.

2.2  Type and characteristics
Table 2.1  shows the main types and characteristics of rolling bearings.
2.3  Selection of bearing arrangement
In general, a shaft is supported by two bearings. 
A bearing that positions and fixes the shaft 
in the axial direction is called the “fixed side 
bearing” and a bearing that allows the axial 
movement is called the “floating side bearing.” 
This allows expansion and contraction of the 
shaft due to temperature variation and absorbs 
errors in the bearing mounting clearance. Fixing 
two bearings without providing a floating side 
bearing applies an excessive load on bearings 
because of the expansion and contraction or the 
error, damaging the bearings at an early stage.
The fixed side bearing is able to support 
radial and axial loads. A bearing that can fix axial 
movement in both directions should therefore 
be selected. A floating side bearing that 
allows movement in the axial direction while 
supporting a radial load is desirable. Movement 
in the axial direction occurs on the raceway 
surface for bearings with separable inner and 
outer rings such as cylindrical roller bearings, 
and occurs on the fitting surface for those 
which are not separable, such as deep groove 
ball bearings.
When shaft expansion and contraction due to 
temperature fluctuations is slight, the same type 
of bearing may be used for both the fixed-side 
and floating-side bearing.
Table 2.2 (1) shows typical bearing 
arrangements where the bearing type differs 
on the fixed side and floating side.Table 2.2 (2) 
shows some common bearing arrangements 
where no distinction is made between the fixed 
side and floating side. Vertical shaft bearing 
arrangements are shown in Table 2.2 (3).

3.  Load rating and life
3.1  Bearing life
Even in bearings operating under normal 
conditions, the surfaces of the raceway and 
rolling elements are constantly being subjected 
to repeated compressive stresses which causes 
flaking of these surfaces to occur. This flaking is 
due to material fatigue and will eventually cause 
bearings to fail.
The effective life of a bearing is usually defined 
in terms of the total number of revolutions a 
bearing can undergo before flaking of either the 
raceway surface or the rolling element surfaces 
occurs.
Other causes of bearing failure are often 
attributed to problems such as seizing, 
abrasions, cracking, chipping, scuffing, rust, etc. 
However, these so called “causes” of bearing 
failure are usually themselves caused by 
improper installation, insufficient or improper 
lubrication, faulty sealing or improper bearing 
selection.
Since the above mentioned “causes” of 
bearing failure can be avoided by taking proper 
precautions, and are not simply caused by 
material fatigue, they are considered separately 
from the flaking aspect.
3.2  Basic rating life and basic dynamic load 
rating
A group of seemingly identical bearings when 
subjected to identical loads and operating 
conditions will exhibit a wide diversity in their 
durability. This “life” disparity can be accounted 
for by the difference in the fatigue of the bearing 
material itself.
This disparity is considered statistically when 
calculating bearing life, and the basic rating life 
is defined as follows.
The basic rating life is based on a 90% 
statistical model which is expressed as the 
total number of revolutions 90% of the 
bearings in an identical group of bearings 
subjected to identical operating conditions will 
attain or surpass before flaking due to material 
fatigue. For bearings operating at fixed 
constant speeds, the basic rating life (90% 
reliability) is expressed in the total number of 
hours of operation. Basic dynamic load rating 
expresses a rolling bearing’s capacity to support 
a dynamic load.
The basic dynamic load rating is the load 
which a bearing can theoretically endure for 
a basic rating life of one million revolutions. 
This is expressed as pure radial load for radial 
bearings and pure axial load for thrust bearings. 
These are referred to as “basic dynamic radial 
load rating (Cr)” and “basic dynamic axial load 
rating (Ca).”
The basic dynamic load ratings given in the 
bearing tables of this catalog are for bearings 
constructed of NTN high quality bearing 
materials and of good manufacturing quality.
The relationship between the basic rating life, 
the basic dynamic load rating and the dynamic 
equivalent load is shown in formulas (3.1) and 
(3.2).

Bearings made of high carbon chrome 
bearing steel, conventionally heat treated, may 
experience dimensional changes during operation 
if used at high temperatures for extended periods 
of time. Temperature stabilization treatment 
(TS treatment) can be used to provide increased 
dimensional stability of bearing materials at 
high operational temperatures. However, the 
dimensional stabilization treatment results in a 
lower overall hardness of heat treated bearing 
materials; therefore, the life is adjusted by 
multiplying by life adjustment factor for special 
bearing properties a2 given in Table 3.3.
For further clarification please consult with

Table 3.2  Life adjustment factor for 
reliability a1
When several bearings are incorporated in 
machines or equipment as complete units, all 
the bearings in the unit are considered as a 
whole when computing bearing system life (see 
formula 3.3).
Where:
L	 : Total basic rating life of entire unit, h
L1, L2…Ln	: Basic rating life of individual 
bearings 1, 2, …n, h
e	: e = 10/9 .......... For ball bearings

e = 9/8 ............. For roller bearings
When the load conditions vary at regular 
intervals, the life can be given by formula (3.4).
Where:
　Lm 	: Total life of bearing, h
　φj 	: Frequency of individual load conditions 
(Σφj = 1)
　Lj 	 : Life under individual conditions, h
If dynamic equivalent load P and rotational 
speed n are operating conditions of the bearing, 
basic rated dynamic load C that satisfies 
required life of the bearing is determined using 
Table 3.1 and formula (3.5). Bearings that 
satisfy the required C can be selected from 
the bearing dimensions table provided in the 
catalog.
3.3  Adjusted rating life
The basic bearing rating life can be calculated 
through the formulas mentioned earlier in 
Section 3.2. However, in some applications 
bearing reliability higher than 90% may be 
                                    1

required. In addition, bearing life may be 
enhanced by the use of specialty bearing 
materials or manufacturing processes. Bearing 
life is also sometimes affected by operating 
conditions such as lubrication, temperature and 
rotational speed.
Basic rating life adjusted to compensate 
for reliability, special bearing materials 
and enhancements, and specific operation 
conditions is called “adjusted rating life,” and is 
determined using formula (3.6).

3.3.1  Life adjustment factor for reliability a1
The value of life adjustment factor for reliability 
a1 is provided in Table 3.2 for reliability of 90% 
or greater.
3.3.2  Life adjustment factor for special 
bearing properties a2
Bearing characteristics concerning life vary 
according to bearing material, quality of material 
and if using a special manufacturing process. In 
this case, life is adjusted using life adjustment 
factor for special bearing properties a2.
The basic dynamic load ratings listed in the 
catalog are based on NTN’s standard material 
and the adjustment factor used is a2 = 1. 
However, an adjustment factor of a2 other than 1 
may be used for bearings with specially enhanced 
materials and manufacturing methods. 
[NOTE: a2 < 1 may occur for temperature 
stabilization] 
a2 > 1 may be used for bearings with specially 
improved materials and manufacturing methods.
Please consult NTN Engineering for life 
adjustment factor for special bearing properties 
(a2) when using dimensional stabilization 
treatment combined with any specialty bearing 
material.
3.3.3  Life adjustment factor for operating 
conditions a3
Life adjustment factor for operating conditions 
a3 is used to compensate for when lubrication 
condition worsens due to a rise in temperature 
or rotational speed, lubricant deteriorates or it 
becomes contaminated with foreign matter.
Generally speaking, when lubricating 
conditions are satisfactory, the a3 factor has a 
value of 1.0; and when lubricating conditions are 
exceptionally favorable, and all other operating 
conditions are normal, a3 can have a value 
greater than 1.0. The factor a3 may be less than 
1.0 due to the following cases:
● Dynamic viscosity of lubrication is too low for 
bearing operating temperature 
(13 mm2/s or less for ball bearings, 20 mm2/s 
or less for roller bearings as a standard)
● Rotational speed is particularly low (when 
the product of pitch diameter Dpw mm and 
rotational speed n min–1 is Dpw ・ n < 10 000)
● Lubricant contaminated with foreign matter 
or moisture
If using a special operating condition, consult 
with NTN Engineering.
The operating life may be also shortened by 
misalignment and operating clearance but these 
operating conditions are not accounted for by 
the a3 factor. (See sections “3.7 Misalignment 
angle (installation error) and life” and “3.8 
Clearance and life.”)
Even if a2 > 1 is used for specialty bearings 
made of enhanced materials or produced by 
special manufacturing methods, a2 x a3 < 1 is 
used if lubricating conditions are not favorable.
When an excessively heavy load is applied, 
harmful plastic distortion may result at the 
contact surfaces between the rolling elements 
and raceways. The formulae for determining 
basic rating life (3.1, 3.2, and 3.6) do not apply if 
Pr exceeds either C0r (basic static load rating) or 
0.5 Cr for radial bearings, or if Pa exceeds 0.5 Ca 
for thrust bearings.

3.4  Modified rating life
3.4.1  Background
Adjusted rating life Lna of bearings is as 
shown in formula (3.6). System conditions 
corresponding to a2 and a3 are considered 
independently in that approach. However, it is 
desirable to consider the integrated system as 
a whole, resulting in adoption of ISO281:2007. 
This approach considers life modification 
factor aISO, which provides a more practical 
method to consider the influence of lubrication, 
contamination and fatigue load on bearing life. 
Based on these decisions in ISO 281, JIS B 1518 
was similarly revised in 2013.
Modified rating life Lnm using life 
modification factor aISO can be obtained by 
formula (3.7).
　Lnm ＝ a1・aISO・L10 ………………（3.7）
3.4.2  Life modification factor aISO
The life modification factor, aISO, is a function 
of lubrication, contamination, material 
characteristics, and load as shown in formula 
3.8.
               ec Cu
aISO ＝ f（    P     
,κ）…………………… (3.8)
Where:
Cu : Fatigue load limit
The fatigue load limit is a load applied on 
bearings that results in the fatigue limit 
stress at the maximum loaded contact 
within the raceway. This depends on 
the bearing type, internal specifications, 
quality, and material strength. In ISO 
281:2007, 1.5GPa is recommended as 
contact stress corresponding to Cu for the 
bearings made of commonly used high 
quality material and  good manufacturing 
quality. The fatigue load limit values with 
respect to the NTN bearing numbers are 
specified in each specification table.
ec : Contamination factor
The presence of hard particle 
contaminants in the lubricant (oil) have 
the potential to form indentations on 
the raceway surface, resulting in surface 
initiated damage and in reduction in 
bearing life. Contamination factor ec 
considers this and depends on the level 
of contamination, bearing size, and 
lubricant viscosity (oil film thickness). As 
shown in Table 3.4, approximate values 
are determined by the bearing size (may 
be substituted by rolling element pitch 
diameter Dpw, average bearing diameter 
(d + D)/2), filtration and seal structures 
(including presence of pre-washing).
κ : Viscosity ratio
Bearings are used on the assumption that 
the rolling contact surface is separated 
by the lubricant. However, when the 
viscosity of the lubricant is low, separation 
becomes insufficient and metal to metal 
contact occurs, causing surface initiated 
damage. Viscosity ratio κ considers this 
effect and is represented by formula (3.9) 
by the ratio of dynamic viscosity ν in 
use with respect to reference dynamic 
viscosity ν1 of the lubricant.
κ = ν / ν1 ……………………… (3.9)
Reference dynamic viscosity ν1 depends 
on rotation speed n and size (Dpw), and can 
be obtained by Fig. 3.2 or formula (3.10) and 
formula (3.11).
In the case of       n ＜1 000min–1,
ν1 = 45 000 n–0.83 Dpw–0.5 ……… (3.10)
In the case of       n ≧1 000min–1,
ν1 = 4 500 n–0.5 Dpw–0.5 ………… (3.11)
Fig. 3.3 shows the relationship among Cu/P, 
ec, κ and, aISO of radial ball bearings. Using the 
figure has the following restrictions:
1) For practical use, the life modification factor 
shall be limited aISO≤ 50.
2) In the case of κ > 4, κ = 4 shall be assumed. 
The same approach does not apply in the 
case of κ < 0.1.
Diagrams for radial roller bearings, thrust ball 
bearings, and thrust roller bearing have also 
been presented (Figs. 3.4 to 3.6). The diagrams 
can be applied regardless of lubrication 
types; however, for grease lubrication, special 
additives, and special rotating behaviors, consult 
with NTN Engineering.

3.5  Machine applications and requisite life
When selecting a bearing, it is essential that 
the requisite life of the bearing be established 
in relation to the operating conditions. The 
requisite life of the bearing is usually determined 
by the type of machine in which the bearing will 
be used, and duration of service and operational 
reliability requirements. A general guide to these 
requisite life criteria is shown in Table 3.5.
When determining bearing size, the fatigue 
life of the bearing is an important factor; 
however, besides bearing life, the strength and 
rigidity of the shaft and housing must also be 
taken into consideration.

3.6  Weibull distribution and life 
adjustment factor for reliability
As described in “3.2 Basic rating life and basic 
dynamic load rating,” a group of seemingly 
identical bearings when subjected to an 
identical load and operating conditions may 
exhibit a wide variation in their durability. In 
general, this variation is known to follow the 
“Weibull distribution,” and the basic theory is 
constructed on the premise that the bearing 
operating life follows the Weibull distribution 
also regarding the life calculation formulae (3.1) 
and (3.2) and the calculation formula of the 
basic dynamic load rating C.
As an index representing the variation of 
the Weibull distribution, there is a coefficient 
called a Weibull slope. A value 10/9 for ball 
bearings and 9/8 for roller bearings are given in 
the basic life calculation theory of ISO and JIS. 
According to this, for example, for a deep groove 
ball bearing, a difference of 5 times or more is 
generated between the L10 life of 90% reliability 
and the L50 life of 50% reliability.
In some applications where a bearing is used, 
a life study with reliability exceeding 90% may 
be required, and in such a case, a life adjustment 
factor for reliability a1 is used. In the latest ISO 
(ISO 281:2007) and JIS (JIS B 1518:2013), a1 
values were updated based on measured test 
data (see Fig. 7). Table 3.2 shows the latest a1 
values after review.
3.7  Misalignment angle (installation error) 
and life
A lack of accuracy and/or rigidity of the shaft 
or housing can cause misalignment between 
the bearing inner and outer rings similar to an 
externally applied moment load.
The bearing operating life calculation in the case 
of receiving a moment load cannot be obtained 
by the commonly used L = (Cr / Pr) P, which is 
generally used, and it is necessary to obtain it 
considering the internal design, clearance, etc. of 
each bearing.
Since the life decrease rate differs depending 
on the internal clearance, the load condition, 
and the internal design, it is necessary to 
calculate the ratio under individual conditions, 
and the rate cannot be given as a factor in 
general.
Fig. 3.8 and Fig. 3.9 show the results of 
detailed calculation of the relationship between 
the misalignment angle (installation error) and 
the life of a deep groove ball bearing and a 
cylindrical roller bearing.
See Table 14.6 in section “14. Shaft and 
housing design” for the rough standard 
of allowable misalignment and allowable 
misalignment of each bearing type.
For further clarification please consult with 
NTN Engineering.

3.8  Clearance and life
It is very difficult to accurately determine what 
the clearance of a rolling bearing should be in a 
normal operating state.
When a bearing is subjected to a simple load 
and full rotation slight clearance is preferable. 
However, too large of a clearance can cause 
life deterioration and vibration. In contrast, 
a negative clearance (preload) can extend 
the operating life and prevent shaft runout. 
However, too large of a preload increases friction, 
temperature rise, lubrication degradation and 
can cause seizures in extreme cases.
As a general guideline a target of zero 
operating clearance should be acceptable.
1) Clearance and rolling element load W
(1) In the case of bearing clearance larger 
than 0 [Fig. 3.11], load distribution ε< 0.5 
holds. The maximum rolling element load 
becomes larger than when the bearing 
clearance is zero [Fig. 3.10]. 

[Load factor ε and conceptual diagram]
(2) Fig. 3.13 shows an ideal graph in which 
operating in a slightly preloaded condition 
results in maximum bearing life.
3.9  Basic static load rating
It has been found through experience that a 
permanent deformation of 0.0001 times the 
diameter of the rolling element, occurring at the 
most heavily stressed contact point between 
the raceway and the rolling elements, can be 
tolerated without any subsequent impariment of 
bearing operation.
Testing indicates the above level of permanent 
deformation corresponds to a calculated contact 
stress as shown below. The basic static load 
rating is defined as the  static applied load which 
results in such a contact stress at the center of 
the contact patch between the raceway and the 
rolling element receiving the maximum load.
Roller bearings: 4 000 MPa
Ball bearings
(excluding self-aligning ball bearings): 4 200 MPa
Self-aligning ball bearings: 4 600 MPa
Referred to as “basic static radial load rating” 
for radial bearings and “basic static axial load 
rating” for thrust bearings, the basic static load 
rating is expressed as C0r or C0a respectively and 
is provided in the bearing dimensions table.
3.10  Allowable static equivalent load
Generally the static equivalent load which 
can be permitted (See page A-41) is limited 
by the basic static load rating as stated in 
Section 3.9. However, depending on application 
requirements regarding friction and smooth 
operation, these limits may be greater or lesser 
than the basic static load rating.
This is generally determined by taking the 
safety factor S0 given in formula (3.12) and 
guidelines of Table 3.6 into account.
　S0 =C0 / P0 …………………………（3.12）
Where:
　S0: Safety factor
　C0: Basic static load rating, N

Radial bearing: C0r

Thrust bearing: C0a
　P0: Static equivalent load, N

Radial bearing: P0r

Thrust bearing: P0a
3.11  Allowable axial load
Radial bearings can also receive axial loads, but 
load is limited depending on the bearing type.
(1) Ball bearing
When an axial load acts on ball bearings, such as 
deep groove ball bearings and angular contact 
ball bearings, the contact angle changes with 
the load. The contact ellipse formed between 
the ball and the raceway surface may protrude 
from the groove when the load exceeds the 
allowable range.
This contact surface has an elliptical shape 
in which 1/2 the major diameter becomes a as 
shown in Fig. 3.14. The maximum allowable 
axial load is the maximum applied load in which 
the contact ellipse does not exceed the shoulder 
of the raceway groove. It is important to note 
that the axial load must result in Pmax < 4200 
MPa even if the contact ellipse does not exceed 
the shoulder of the groove. The allowable axial 
load differs depending on the bearing internal 
clearance, groove curvature, and groove 
shoulder dimension.
When a combination radial and axial load is 
applied, verify truncation does not occur at the 
maximum loaded rolling element.

A tapered roller bearing supports axial load

Therefore, the bearing can receive a larger

However, there are different limits depending on 
the rotational speed and lubrication conditions 
because sliding contact occurs between the 
roller large end face and the large end rib inside 
face. Generally, the PV value, which is obtained 
by multiplying the sliding speed to the sliding 
surface pressure, is checked and calculated by a 
computer. 
For further clarification please consult with 
NTN Engineering.
(3) Cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings with ribs on the inner 
and outer rings are capable of simultaneously 
supporting a certain degree of radial and axial 
loads. Unlike basic dynamic load ratings which 
are based on rolling fatigue, allowable axial load 
is determined by heat generated at the sliding 
surface between the ends of the rollers and rib 
which may cause wear and/or seizure. Based on 
testing and experience, allowable axial load can 
be estimated using formula (3.13).

load (Fa max)

　d 	 : Bearing bore mm
　Pz 	: Allowable surface pressure of rib MPa 
(see Fig. 3.16)
If the axial load is greater than the radial load, 
the rollers will not rotate properly. The allowable 
axial load therefore must not exceed the value 
for Fa max given in Table 3.7.
The following are also important to operate 
the bearing smoothly under an axial load:
1) Do not make the internal radial clearance 
any larger than necessary because it 
may affect life and abrasion between the 
raceway surface and the roller.
2) Use lubricant with an extreme pressure 
additive to suppress heat generation, 
seizure, and abrasion between the roller 
end surface and the rib.
3) Make the shoulder of the housing and 
shaft high enough for the rib of the 
bearing to prevent it from being damaged.
4) If the bearing is to support an extreme 
axial load, mounting precision should 
be improved and the bearing should be 
rotated slowly before actual use.
If large cylindrical roller bearings (bore of 300 
mm or more) are to support an axial load or 
moment load simultaneously, please contact 
NTN Engineering.
NTN Engineering also offers cylindrical roller 
bearings for high axial loads (HT type). For 
details, please contact NTN Engineering.
3.12  Review of basic dynamic load ratings
As a result of continuous improvement 
related to material cleanliness, and production 
techniques,  years of in-house durability testing 
has confirmed NTN bearings produced today 
have a longer operating life compared with past 
products. Based on this bearing life test data, 
the basic dynamic load ratings of ball and roller 
bearings were reviewed and updated to more 
accurately reflect true bearing performance.
The basic dynamic load ratings for many NTN 
products have been formally increased and can 
be found in the dimensional tables for each 
bearing type within this catalog.
＊ Some bearings use the same basic dynamic 
load rating as conventional products.
3.13  Bearing life calculation tool
The basic rating life of bearings can be 
calculated using the bearing technical 
calculation tool on the NTN website (https://
www.ntnglobal.com/tool/calc/).

To compute bearing loads, the forces which act 
on the shaft being supported by the bearing 
must be determined. Loads which act on the 
shaft and its related parts include weight of the 
rotating components, load produced when the 
machine performs work, and load produced by 
transmission of dynamic force. These can be 
mathematically calculated, but calculation is 
difficult in many cases.
A method of calculating loads that act upon 
shafts that convey dynamic force, which is the 
primary application of bearings, is provided 
herein.
4.1  Load acting on shafts
4.1.1  Load factor
There are many instances where the actual 
operational shaft load is much greater than the 
theoretically calculated load, due to shock. This 
actual shaft load can be estimated by using 
formula (4.1).

4.1.2  Gear load
The loads operating on gears can be divided 
into three main types according to the direction 
in which the load is applied; i.e. tangential (Kt), 
radial (Ks), and axial (Ka). The magnitude and 
direction of these loads differ according to the 
types of gears involved. The following refers to 
the calculation methods of loads acting on four 
types of gears.
(1) Loads acting on parallel shaft gears
The forces acting on spur gears and helical gears 
are depicted in Fig. 4.1 to Fig. 4.3.

Table 4.2  Gear factor fz
Loads acting on gears are obtained from 
formulas (4.2) to (4.6).
Equation 4.2 describes the gear load in the 
tangential direction when the shaft input torque 
is known
　Kt ＝ 2T ……………………………… (4.2)
　         Dp
Equation 4.3 describes the gear load in the 
tangential direction when the transmitted power 
is known
Where:
　Kt	 : Tangential gear load (tangential force), N
　Ks	 : Radial gear load (separating force), N
　Kr	 : Right angle shaft load (resultant force 
of tangential force and separating 
force), N
　Ka	: Parallel load on shaft, N
　T	 : Input torque, N · mm
　H	 : Transmitted force, kW
　n	 : Rotational speed min‒1
　Dp	: Gear pitch circle diameter, mm
　α : Gear pressure angle, deg
　β : Helix angle, deg
Because the actual gear load also contains 
vibrations and shock loads as well, the 
theoretical load obtained by the above formula 
can also be adjusted by the gear factor fz as 
shown in Table 4.2.
　Kt ＝19.1 × 106・H  ····················· (4.3)
                Dp・n
　Ks ＝Kt・tan α (Spur gear) ··········· (4.4a)
　　 ＝Kt・tan α (Helical gear) ········ (4.4b)
　　           cos β
　Kr ＝　Kt2 ＋Ks2  ························· (4.5)
　Ka ＝Kt・tan β (Helical gear) ········ (4.6)
(2) Loads acting on cross shafts 
Gear loads acting on straight tooth bevel gears 
and spiral bevel gears on cross shafts are shown 
in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. The calculation methods for 
these gear loads are shown in Table 4.3.
Herein, to calculate gear loads for straight 
bevel gears, the helix angle β = 0.
The symbols and units used in Table 4.3 are 
as follows:
　Kt	 : Tangential gear load (tangential force), N
　Ks	 : Radial gear load (separating force), N
　Ka	 : Parallel shaft load (axial load), N
　H	
: Transmitted power, kW
　n	
: Rotational speed min‒1
　Dpm	: Mean pitch circle diameter, mm
　α : Gear pressure angle, deg
　β : Helix angle, deg
　δ : Pitch cone angle, deg
Because the two shafts intersect, pinions and 
gears have the relationship of formula (4.7) and 
formula (4.8).
　Ksp ＝ Kag ……………………………… (4.7)
　Kap ＝ Ksg ……………………………… (4.8)
Where:
　Ksp , Ksg : Pinion and Gear separating force, N
　Kap , Kag : Pinion and Gear axial load, N
For spiral bevel gears, the direction of the load 
varies depending on the direction of the helix 
angle, the direction of rotation, and which side is 
the driving side or the driven side. The directions 
for the separating force (Ks) and axial load (Ka) 
shown in Fig. 4.5 are positive directions. The 
direction of rotation and the helix angle direction 
are defined as viewed from the large end of the 
gear. The gear rotation direction in Fig. 4.5 is 
assumed to be clockwise (right).

A worm gear is a gear made by combining a 
worm (screw gear) and a worm wheel (helical 
gear). The gear direction differs depending on 
the rotation direction and the screw direction 
(right screw, left screw) of the worm shaft. 
Fig. 4.8 shows the direction of loads acting on 
the gear, and Table 4.5 shows the calculation 
method of the loads.

4.1.3  Chain / belt shaft load
The tangential loads on sprockets or pulleys 
when power (load) is transmitted by means of 
chains or belts can be calculated by formula 
(4.19) as shown in Fig. 4.9.
Where:
　Kt	 : Sprocket/pulley tangential load, N
　H	 : Transmitted power, kW
　Dp	: Sprocket/pulley pitch diameter, mm
For belt drives, an initial tension is applied to 
give sufficient constant operating tension on the 
belt and pulley.
Taking this tension into account, the radial 
loads acting on the pulley are expressed by 
formula (4.20). For chain drives, the same 
formula can also be used if vibrations and shock 
loads are taken into consideration.
　Kr ＝ fb ・ Kt  ………………………（4.20）

4.2  Bearing load distribution
For shafting, the static tension is considered 
to be supported by the bearings, and any 
loads acting on the shafts are distributed to 
the bearings. For example, in the gear shaft 
assembly depicted in Fig. 4.10, the applied 
bearing loads can be found by using formulas 
(4.21) and (4.22).
This example is a simple case, but in reality, 
many of the calculations are quite complicated.

4.3  Mean load
The load on bearings used in machines under 
normal circumstances will, in many cases, 
fluctuate according to a fixed time period 
or planned operation schedule. The load on 
bearings operating under such conditions can 
be converted to a mean load (Fm). This is a load 
which gives bearings the same life they would 
have under constant operating conditions.
(1) Fluctuating stepped load (Fig. 4.11)
The mean bearing load, Fm, for stepped loads 
is calculated from formula (4.23). F1, F2 ..... Fn 
are the loads acting on the bearing; n1, n2 ..... 
nn and t1, t2 ..... tn are the bearing speeds and 
operating times respectively.

in terms of load cycle to and time t, the mean 
load is found by using formula (4.24).

4.4  Equivalent load
4.4.1  Dynamic equivalent load
When both dynamic radial loads and dynamic 
axial loads act on a bearing at the same time, the 
hypothetical load acting on the center of the 
bearing which gives the bearings the same life 
as if they had only a radial load or only an axial 
load is called the dynamic equivalent load.
For radial bearings, this load is expressed 
as pure radial load and is called the dynamic 
equivalent radial load. For thrust bearings, it is 
expressed as pure axial load, and is called the 
dynamic equivalent axial load.
(1) Dynamic equivalent radial load
The dynamic equivalent radial load is expressed 
by formula (4.28).
　Pr ＝ XFr ＋ YFa ……………………… (4.28)
Where:
　Pr	 : Dynamic equivalent radial load, N
　Fr	 : Actual radial load, N
　Fa	: Actual axial load, N
　X	 : Radial load factor
　Y	 : Axial load factor
The values for X and Y are listed in the bearing 
tables.
(2) Dynamic equivalent axial load
As a rule, standard thrust bearings with α 
contact angle of 90° cannot carry radial loads. 
However, self-aligning thrust roller bearings can 
accept some radial load. The dynamic equivalent 
axial load for these bearings is given in formula 
(4.29).
　Pa ＝ Fa + 1.2Fr ……………………… (4.29)
Where:
　Pa	: Dynamic equivalent axial load, N
　Fa	: Actual axial load, N
　Fr	 : Actual radial load, N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦ 0.55 only.
4.4.2  Static equivalent load
The static equivalent load is a hypothetical 
load which would cause the same total 
permanent deformation at the most heavily 
stressed contact point between the rolling 
elements and the raceway as under actual load 
conditions; that is when both static radial loads 
and static axial loads are simultaneously applied 
to the bearing.
For radial bearings this hypothetical load refers 
to pure radial loads, and for thrust bearings it 
refers to pure centric axial loads. These loads 
are designated static equivalent radial loads and 
static equivalent axial loads respectively.
(1) Static equivalent radial load
For radial bearings the static equivalent radial 
load can be found by using formula (4.30) or 
(4.31). The greater of the two resultant values is 
always taken for P0r.
　P0r ＝ X0 Fr ＋ Y0 Fa ………………… (4.30)
　P0r ＝ Fr ……………………………… (4.31)
Where:
　P0r	: Static equivalent radial load, N
　Fr	 : Actual radial load, N
　Fa	 : Actual axial load, N
　X0	 : Static radial load factor
　Y0	 : Static axial load factor
The values for X0 and Y0 are given in the 
respective bearing tables.
(2) Static equivalent axial load
For spherical thrust roller bearings the static 
equivalent axial load is expressed by formula 
(4.32).
　P0a ＝ Fa ＋ 2.7Fr …………………… (4.32)
Where:
　P0a	: Static equivalent axial load, N
　Fa	 : Actual axial load, N
　Fr	 : Actual radial load, N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦ 0.55 only.

located as shown in Fig. 4.15, and their 
values are listed in the bearing tables.
When radial loads act on these 
types of bearings a component force is 
induced in the axial direction. For this 
reason, these bearings are used in pairs. 
For load calculation this component 
force must be taken into consideration 
and is expressed by formula (4.33).
Where:
　Fa	: Axial component force, N
　Fr	: Actual radial load, N
　Y	 : Axial load factor
The axial loads for these bearing pairs

4.5  Bearing rating life and load calculation 
examples
In the examples given in this section, for the 
purpose of calculation, all hypothetical load 
factors as well as all calculated load factors may 
be presumed to be included in the resultant load 
values.
Bearing loads and the basic rating life of 
bearings can be calculated using the bearing 
technical calculation tool on the NTN website 
(https://www.ntnglobal.com).
(Example 1)
What is the rating life in hours of operation 
L10h for deep groove ball bearing 6208 
operating at rotational speed n ＝ 650 min‒1, 
with a radial load Fr of 3.2 kN?
From formula (4.28) the dynamic equivalent 
radial load Pr:
　Pr ＝ Fr ＝ 3.2kN
Basic dynamic load rating Cr for bearing 6208 
given on page B-26 is 32.5 kN, ball bearing 
speed factor fn relative to rotational speed  
n = 650 min‒1 from Fig. 3.1 is fn = 0.37. Thus life 
factor fh from formula (3.5) is:
Therefore, with fh = 3.76 from Fig. 3.1 the 
rated life, L10h, is approximately 27 000 hours.
(Example 2)
What is the life rating L10h for the same 
bearing and conditions as in Example 1, but 
with an additional axial load Fa of 1.8 kN?
To find the dynamic equivalent radial load 
value for Pr, the radial load factor X, axial load 
factor Y, and Constant e are used.
Basic static load rating C0r for bearing 6208 
　fh ＝fn Cr ＝0.37 ×  32.5 ＝3.76
                Pr                  3.2
given on page B-26 is 17.8 kN and f0 is 14.0. 
Therefore:
Calculated by the proportional interpolation 
method given on B-27, e = 0.30.
For the operating radial load and axial load:
From B-27, X = 0.56 and Y = 1.44,  
and from formula (4.28) the dynamic equivalent 
radial load, Pr, is:
　Pr ＝ XFr＋YFa
　　＝ 0.56 × 3.2＋1.43 × 1.8
　　＝ 4.38　kN
From Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.1 the life factor, fh, 
is:
Therefore, with life factor fh = 2.75, from Fig. 
3.1 the rated life, L10h, is approximately 10,500 
hours.
(Example 3)
Determine the optimum model number for 
a cylindrical roller bearing operating at the 
rotational speed n ＝ 450 min‒1, with a radial 
load Fr of 200 kN, and which must have a life 
(L10h) of over 20 000 hours.
From Fig. 3.1 the life factor  
fh = 3.02 (L10h at 20 000), and the speed factor  
fn = 0.46 (n = 450 min‒1). To find the required 
basic dynamic load rating, Cr, formula (3.5) is 
used.
From page B-108, the smallest bearing that fulfills 
all the requirements is NU2332E (Cr = 1 460 kN).
　f0・Fa ＝ 14 ×1.8 ＝1.42
     C0r          17.8
　Fa ＝ 1.8 ＝0.56 ＞e = 0.30
　Fr     3.2
　fh ＝fn
 Cr ＝ 0.37 × 32.5 ＝ 2.75

The dynamic equivalent radial load, Pr , for

formula (4.28) and shown in Table 4.9 . Because 
all the values for Fri and Fai from the bearing 
tables are greater than Fa / Fr > e ＝ 0.17,  
X ＝ 0.67, Y2 ＝ 5.81
　Pri ＝ XFri ＋Y2  Fai ＝ 0.67Fri ＋ 5.81Fai

Find the threshold values for rating life time 
and allowable axial load when cylindrical 
roller bearing NUP312 is used under the 
following conditions:
Provided that intermittent axial load and 
oil lubricant.
　Radial load Fr ＝ 10kN
　Rotational speed n ＝ 2 000min‒1
Radial load Fr is 10 kN, and
　Pr ＝ Fr ＝ 10kN
The speed factor of cylindrical roller bearing,
　fn , at n ＝ 2 000 min‒1 , from Table 3.1
The life factor, fh , from Table 3.1
Therefore the basic rated life, L10h , from 
Table 3.1
　L10h ＝ 500 × 4.0110/3 ≒ 51 000 hours
Next, the allowable axial load of the cylindrical 
roller bearing is shown on page A-32.
In formula (3.13) on page A-32, based on 
NUP312 from Table 3.7 on page A-33, k = 0.065.
In addition, Dpw ＝ (60 + 130) / 2 ＝ 95 mm,  
n ＝ 2 000 min‒1.
Thus, the formula below holds when the 
case of the intermittent axial load is taken into 
consideration.
　Dpw ・ n × 104 ＝ 19 × 104
In Fig. 3.16 on page A-33, Dpw ・ n ＝ 19 × 104.  
In the case of the intermittent axial load, 
allowable surface pressure at the lip Pt ＝ 40 MPa.
Therefore the allowable axial load, Pt , 
becomes the following.
　Pt ＝ 0.065 × 602 × 40 ＝ 9 360N
Based on Table 3.7 on page A-33, it is within 
the limits of Fa max < 0.4 × 10 000 = 4 000 N. 
Therefore Pt < 4 000 N.

5.1  Boundary dimensions
A rolling bearing’s major dimensions, known 
as “boundary dimensions,” are shown in Figs. 
5.1 - 5.3. To facilitate international bearing 
interchangeability and economical bearing 
production, bearing boundary dimensions 
have been standardized by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). In 
Japan, rolling bearing boundary dimensions are 
regulated by Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS 
B 1512 series).
Boundary dimensions which have been 
standardized include: bearing bore diameter, 
outside diameter, width/height, and chamfer 
dimensions - all important dimensions when 
considering the compatibility of shafts, bearings, 
and housings. However, as a general rule, 
bearing internal construction dimensions are not 
covered by these standards.
For metric series rolling bearings there are 90 
standardized bore diameters (d) ranging in size 
from 0.6 mm - 2,500 mm.
Outer diameter dimensions (D) for radial 
bearings with standardized bore diameter 
dimensions are covered in the “diameter 
series;” their corresponding width dimensions 
(B) are covered in the “width series.” For thrust 
bearings there is no width series; instead, these 
dimensions are covered in the “height series.” 
The combination of all these series is known as 
the “dimension series.” All series numbers are 
shown in Table 5.1.
Although many rolling bearing dimensions 
are standardized and have been listed here for 
purposes of future standardization, there are 
many standard bearing dimensions which are 
not presently manufactured.
Boundary dimensions for radial bearings and 
thrust bearings are shown in the attached tables 
(I-2 to I-19).

5.2  Bearing numbers
Rolling bearing part numbers indicate bearing 
type, dimensions, tolerances, internal 
construction, and other related specifications. 
Bearing numbers are comprised of a “basic 
number” followed by “supplementary codes.” 
The makeup and order of bearing numbers is 
shown in Table 5.2.
The basic number indicates general 
information about a bearing, such as its 
fundamental type, boundary dimensions, 
series number, bore diameter code and contact 
angle. The supplementary codes derive from 
prefixes and suffixes which indicate a bearing’s 
tolerances, internal clearances, and related 
specifications.
“ULTAGE” (a name created from the 
combination of “ultimate,” signifying refinement, 
and “stage,” signifying NTN’s intention that 
this series of products be employed in diverse 
applications) is the general name for NTN’s new 
generation of bearings that are noted for their 
industry-leading performance.

●Bearing Tolerances
●Bearing Tolerances
A-54
A-55
6.1  Dimensional and rotational accuracy
Bearing “tolerances” or dimensional accuracy 
and running accuracy, are regulated by ISO 
and JIS standards, JIS B 1514 (rolling bearing 
tolerances) series. For dimensional accuracy, 
these standards prescribe the tolerances 
necessary when installing bearings on shafts 
or in housings. Running accuracy is defined as 
the allowable limits for bearing runout during 
operation.
Dimensional accuracy
Dimensional accuracy constitutes the 
acceptable values for bore diameter, outer 
diameter, assembled bearing width, and 
bore diameter uniformity as seen in chamfer 
dimensions, allowable inner ring tapered bore 
deviation and shape error. Also included are 
variation of mean bore diameter within a plane, 
outer diameter within a plane, mean outer 
diameter within a plane, as well as raceway 
thickness (for thrust bearings).
Running accuracy
Running accuracy constitutes the acceptable 
values for inner and outer ring radial runout and 
axial runout, inner ring side surface squareness, 
and outer ring outer diameter squareness.
Allowable rolling bearing tolerances have 
been established according to precision classes. 
Bearing precision is stipulated as JIS class 6, 
class 5, class 4, or class 2, with precision rising 
from ordinary precision indicated by class 0.
Table 6.1 indicates which standards and 
precision classes are applicable to the major 
bearing types. Table 6.2 shows a relative 
comparison between JIS B 1514 precision class 
standards and other standards.
For details of allowable limitations and values, 
refer to Tables 6.4 - 6.10, which are described 
in the application table column of Table 6.1. 
Allowable values for chamfer dimensions are 
shown in Table 6.11. Allowable limitations and 
values for radial bearing inner ring tapered bores 
are shown in Table 6.12.

Terms
Quantifiers
Description
Nominal bore diameter
d
Reference dimension representing the bore diameter size, and reference value 
with respect to the dimensional difference of the actual bore diameter surface.
Single bore diameter
ds
Distance between two parallel straight lines that are in contact with the 
intersection line of the actual bearing bore diameter surface and the radial plane.
Deviation of a single 
bore diameter
Δ ds
Difference between ds and d (difference of nominal diameter serving as the 
measured bore and standard).
Mean bore diameter in 
a single plane
dmp
Arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum measured bore diameters 
within one radial plane. In the model figure, in arbitrary radial plane Ai, when the 
maximum bore diameter is dsi1 and the minimum bore diameter is dsi3, the value 
is obtained by (dsi1 + dsi3)/2. There is one value for each plane.
Mean bore diameter
dm
Arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum measured bore diameters 
obtained from all the cylindrical surfaces. In the model figure, when the maximum 
measured bore diameter is ds11 and the minimum measured bore diameter is ds23, 
which are obtained from the all the planes A1, A2,…Ai, the mean bore diameter is 
obtained by (ds11 + ds23)/2. There is one value for one cylindrical surface.
Deviation of mean bore 
diameter
Δ dm
Difference between the mean bore diameter and the nominal bore diameter.
Deviation of mean bore 
diameter in a single 
plane
Δ dmp
Difference between the arithmetic mean and the nominal bore diameter of the 
maximum and minimum measured bore diameters within one radial plane. The 
value is specified in JIS.
Variation of bore 
diameter in a single 
plane
Vdsp
Difference between the maximum and minimum measured bore diameters within 
one radial plane. In the model figure, in radial plane A1, when the maximum 
measured bore diameter is ds11 and the minimum measured bore diameter is 
ds13, the difference is Vdsp and one value can be obtained for one plane. This 
characteristic is an index that indicates the roundness. The value is specified in JIS.
Variation of mean bore 
diameter
Vdmp
Difference between the maximum and minimum values of the mean bore 
diameter within a plane that are obtained from all the planes. A unique value 
is obtained for each product, and it is near to cylindricity (that is different from 
geometric cylindricity). The value is specified in JIS.
Nominal inner ring 
width
B
Distance between both theoretical side surfaces of a raceway. This value is a 
reference dimension that represents the raceway surface (distance between both 
side surfaces).
Single inner ring width
Bs
Distance between two intersections. The straight is perpendicular to the plane 
that is in contact with the inner ring reference side and both actual side surfaces. 
This value represents the actual width dimension of an inner ring.
Deviation of a single 
inner ring width
Δ Bs
Difference between the measured inner ring width and the nominal inner ring 
width. This value is also the difference between the measured inner ring width 
dimension and the reference dimension that represents the inner ring width. The 
value is specified in JIS. 
Variation of inner ring 
width
VBs
Difference between the maximum and minimum measured inner ring widths, 
which are specified in JIS.
Radial runout of inner 
ring of assembled 
bearing
Kia
Difference between the maximum and minimum values of the radial distance 
between the inner ring bore diameter at each angle position and one fixed point of 
the outer ring outer diameter surface with respect to radial runout.
Axial runout of inner 
ring of assembled 
bearing
Sia
Difference between the maximum and minimum values of the axial distance 
between the inner ring reference side surface at each angle position and one 
fixed point of the outer ring outer diameter surface with respect to half the radial 
distance of the raceway contact diameter from the inner ring central axis and the 
inner ring of a deep groove ball bearing.

6.5  Geometrical product specifications 
(GPS)
GPS is an abbreviation of geometrical product 
specifications. GPS is the new drawing notation 
for accurately describing the geometrical 
specifications of product shapes, dimensions, 
and surface characteristics. The standard that 
specifies rules for making drawings with GPS is 
called “GPS standard.”
<Purpose of GPS>
While conventional drawing notation 
typically describes product dimensions and 
characteristics accurately, there are several 
“unclear” aspects of the conventional notation 
that can lead to varying interpretations (see 
Fig. 6.2). The main purpose of the GPS is to 
eliminate the ambiguity of drawing notation, 
thereby preventing troubles.
Fig. 6.2  Notation example of bearing bore diameter tolerance
Conventional notation
GPS notation
The dimensional tolerance of bearing 
bore diameters is specified in ISO/
JIS as “Dimensional tolerance of mean 
bore diameter within plane” (see Table 
6.4 (1)). However, expressions such as 
“within plane” and “mean” are omitted 
in the conventional drawing notation as 
shown above. This can lead to several 
interpretations of the dimensional 
tolerance.
GPS code “SD” represents “middle” and 
“ACS” represents “arbitrary cross section.” 
By adding these two codes after the inner 
bore tolerance, it is possible to clearly 
express “middle of the measured diameter 
within an arbitrary cross section”, which 
is the dimensional tolerance of the mean 
bore diameter within a plane.

7.2  The necessity of a proper fit
In some cases, an improper fit may lead to 
damage and shorten bearing life. Therefore it is 
necessary to carefully select the proper fit. Some 
possible bearing failures caused by an improper 
fit are listed below.
●  Raceway cracking, early flaking and 
displacement of raceway
●  Raceway and shaft or housing abrasion 
caused by creeping and fretting corrosion
●  Seizing caused by negative internal 
clearances
●  Increased noise and deteriorated 
rotational accuracy due to raceway groove 
deformation
Please refer to “16. Bearing Damage and 
Corrective Measures” for information concerning 
diagnosis of these conditions.
7.1  Resultant fits
For rolling bearings, it is necessary to fix inner 
and outer rings on the shaft or in the housing so 
that relative movement does not occur between 
fitting surfaces during operation or under load. 
This relative movement between the mating 
surfaces of the bearing and the shaft or housing 
can occur in a radial direction, an axial direction, 
or in the direction of rotation. Types of resultant 
fit include tight, transition and loose fits, which 
describe whether or not there is interference 
between the bearing and the shaft or housing.
The most effective way to fix the mating 
surfaces between a bearing and shaft or 
housing is to apply a “tight fit.” The advantage 
of a tight fit for thin walled bearings is that it 
provides uniform load support over the entire 
ring circumference without any loss of load 
carrying capacity. However, with a tight fit, 
ease of installation and disassembly is lost; and 
when using a non-separable bearing as the 
floating-side bearing, axial displacement is not 
possible. For this reason, a tight fit cannot be 
recommended in all cases.

7.3  Fit selection
Selection of a proper fit is dependent upon 
thorough analysis of bearing operating 
conditions, including consideration of:
● Shaft and housing material, wall thickness, 
surface finish accuracy, etc.
● Machinery operating conditions (nature 
and magnitude of load, rotational speed, 
temperature, etc.)
7.3.1  “Tight fit” or “Loose fit”
(1) For bearing rings under rotating loads, a 
tight fit is necessary. (Refer to Table 7.1) 
“Raceways under rotating loads” refers to 
raceways receiving loads rotating relative 
to their radial direction.  
　For bearing rings under static loads, on 
the other hand, a loose fit is sufficient.
(Example) Rotating inner ring load = the 
direction of the radial load on the 
inner ring is rotating relatively
(2) For non-separable bearings, such as 
deep groove ball bearings, it is generally 
recommended that either the inner ring or 
outer ring be given a loose fit.

7.3.2  Recommended fits
Bearing fit is governed by the tolerances 
selected for bearing shaft diameters and 
housing bore diameters.
Widely used fits for Class 0 tolerance bearings 
and various shaft and housing bore diameter 
tolerances are shown in Fig. 7.1.
Generally-used, standard fits for most types of 
bearings and operating conditions are shown in 
Tables 7.2 to 7.7.

Fits of (ANSI/ABMA CLASS 3, 
CLASS 0)
Table 7.5 shows fits and their numerical 
values.
For special fits or applications, please consult 
NTN Engineering.
7.3.3  Interference minimum and maximum 
values
The following points should be considered when 
it is necessary to calculate the interference for 
an application:
● Regarding minimum values,
1) interference is reduced by radial loads
2) interference is reduced by differences 
between bearing temperature and 
ambient temperature
3) interference is reduced by variation in 
mating surface
4) interference is reduced by deformation
● The upper limit value should not exceed  
1/ 1 000 of the shaft diameter.
Required interference calculations are shown 
below.
(1) Mating surface variation and interference
Interference decreases because the mating 
surface is smoothed by the resultant fit 
(surface roughness is reduced). The amount 
the interference decreases depends on the 
roughness of the mating surfaces. It is generally 
necessary to anticipate the following decrease in 
interference.
For ground shafts: 1.0 to 2.5 μm
For machined shafts: 5.0 to 7.0 μm
The interference including this decrease 
amount is called effective interference.
(2) Radial loads and required interference
Interference of the inner ring and shaft 
decreases when a radial load is applied to 
the bearing. The interference required for 
installation to solid shafts is expressed by 
formulae (7.1) and (7.2) for each load condition.

For solid shafts, please contact NTN

(3) Temperature difference and required 
interference
Interference between inner rings and steel 
shafts is reduced as a result of temperature 
increases (difference between bearing 
temperature and ambient temperature, Δ T) 
caused by bearing rotation. Calculation of the 
minimum required amount of interference in 
such cases is shown in formula (7.3).

(4) Maximum interference
When bearing rings are installed with an 
interference fit, tensile or compressive stress 
may occur along their raceways. If interference 
is too great, this may cause damage to the 
rings and reduce bearing life. The maximum 
stress due to the resultant fit must not exceed 
approximately 127 MPa for safety. If the value is 
to be exceeded, consult NTN Engineering.
See section “17.4 Resultant fit surface 
pressure” for the calculation method of 
maximum stress due to the resultant fit.
(5) Interference change amount when 
materials other than steel are used for 
shafts and housings
When materials other than steel are used for 
shafts and housings, the fits between the inner 
ring and the shaft and the outer ring and the 
housing change because of difference in the 
expansion coefficient of each material as the 
temperature rises during the rotation of the 
bearing. Therefore, it is necessary to set the 
resultant fit with expansion coefficients in 
consideration. The calculation formula of the 
change in interference is shown below.
　Δ dTE = (α1‒α2 )× d × Δ T
　Δ dTE	: Change in interference caused 
by difference in the expansion 
coefficients mm
　α1	 : Bearing expansion coefficient 1/°C
　α2	 : Shaft and housing expansion 
coefficient 1/°C
　d	
: Reference dimension of resultant fit 
mm
　Δ T	
: Temperature increase by bearing 
rotation °C
(Expansion coefficient: See Table 13.19 in 
“13. Bearing Materials.”)
7.3.4  Other details
(1) Large interference fits are recommended for,
● Operating conditions with large vibrations 
or shock loads
● Applications using hollow shafts or 
housings with thin walls
● Applications using housings made of light 
alloys or plastic
(2) Small interference fits are preferable for,
● Applications requiring high running 
accuracy
● Applications using small sized bearings or 
thin walled bearings
(3) Consideration must also be given to the fact 
that fit selection will effect internal bearing 
clearance selection. (refer to page A-88.)
(4) A particular type of fit is recommended for 
SL type cylindrical roller bearings. (refer to 
page C-67.)
(5) Bearing dimensions are measured and 
managed at a temperature of 20°C.

F7 be used for large bearings or 
bearings with large temperature 
differential between the outer 
ring and housing.
If high accuracy is required, Js6 
and K6 are used in place of Js7 
and K7.
1) Standards for light loads, normal loads, and heavy loads
Light loads: dynamic equivalent radial load ≦ 0.05 Cr
Normal loads: 0.05 Cr ≦ dynamic equivalent radial load ≦ 0.10 Cr
Heavy loads: 0.10 Cr < dynamic equivalent radial load
2) The axial direction needs to be secured because the outer ring may move in the shaft direction, causing problems, depending on the 
use. (Example: planetary gear, etc.)
3) Indicates whether or not outer ring axial movement is possible with non-separable type bearings.
Note: 1. All values and fits listed in the above tables are for cast iron or steel housings.

2. If only a center axial load is applied to the bearing, select a tolerance class that provides clearance for the outer ring in the radial 
direction.
Table 7.2 (3)  Tolerance class of housing bores commonly used for radial bearings (classes 0, 6X and 6)

8.  Bearing internal clearance and preload
8.1  Bearing internal clearance
Bearing internal clearance is the amount of 
internal free movement before mounting. As 
shown in Fig. 8.1, when either the inner ring 
or the outer ring is fixed and the other ring is 
free to move, displacement can take place in 
either an axial or radial direction. This amount 
of displacement (radially or axially) is termed 
the internal clearance and, depending on the 
direction, is called the radial internal clearance 
or the axial internal clearance.
When the internal clearance of a bearing 
is measured, a slight measurement load is 
applied to the raceway so the internal clearance 
may be measured accurately. However, at this 
time, a slight amount of elastic deformation 
of the bearing occurs under the measurement 
load, and the clearance measurement value 
(measured clearance) is slightly larger than 
the true clearance. This difference between 
the true bearing clearance and the increased 
amount due to the elastic deformation must be 
compensated for. These compensation values 
are given in Table 8.1. For roller bearings the 
amount of elastic deformation is small enough 
to be ignored. The internal clearance values 
for each bearing class are shown in Tables 8.8 
through 8.16.
8.2  Selection of internal clearance
The internal clearance of a bearing under 
operating conditions (effective clearance) 
is usually smaller than the initial clearance 
before being installed and operated. This is 
due to several factors including bearing fit, the 
difference in temperature between the inner 
and outer rings, etc. As a bearing’s operating 
clearance has an effect on bearing life, heat 
generation, vibration, noise, etc.; care must be 
taken in selecting the most suitable operating 
clearance.
8.2.1  Criteria for selecting bearing internal 
clearance
A bearing’s life is theoretically at its maximum 
when operating clearance is slightly negative in 
steady operation. However, in reality it is difficult 
to constantly maintain this optimal condition. 
If the negative clearance becomes larger by 
fluctuating operating conditions, heat will be 
produced and the life will decrease severely. 
Under normal circumstances, a study should 
be performed to select an operating clearance 
slightly larger than zero. For ordinary operating 
conditions, use fitting for ordinary loads. If 
rotational speed and operating temperature are 
ordinary, selecting normal clearance enables you 
to obtain the proper operating clearance.
Table 8.2 gives examples applying internal 
clearances other than CN (normal) clearance.
For the relationship between clearance and 
life, see the section of “3.8 Clearance and life.”
8.2.2  Calculation of operating clearance
Operating clearance of a bearing can be 
calculated from initial bearing internal clearance 
and considering the decrease in clearance due 
to fitting and the difference in temperature of 
the inner and outer rings.
　Δ e ＝ Δ 0 －(δf + δt )=Δ f －δt ………(8.1)
Where:
　Δ e	 : Effective internal clearance, mm
　Δ 0	 : Bearing internal clearance (initial), mm
　Δ f	 : Residual clearance (clearance after 
preloading), mm
　δf	 : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
fitting, mm
　δt	 : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
temperature differential of inner and 
outer rings, mm
(1) Reduced clearance due to fitting
When bearings are installed with interference 
fits on shafts and in housings, the inner ring will 
expand and the outer ring will contract; thus 
reducing the bearings’ internal clearance. 
The amount of expansion or contraction varies 
depending on the shape of the bearing, the 
shape of the shaft or housing, dimensions of the 
respective parts, and the type of materials used. 
The differential can range from approximately 
70% to 90% of the effective interference.
　δf ＝ (0.70 〜0.90) Δ deff ……………(8.2)
　　δf	
: Reduced amount of clearance due 
to interference, mm
　　Δ deff	: Effective interference, mm

(2) Residual clearance
When the reduced clearance due to interference 
is calculated using the expansion rate and the 
contraction rate of each bearing, the residual 
clearance is calculated by the formula below.
1) Calculation considering distribution
Assume that the initial clearance, bearing inner 
ring bore diameter, bearing outer diameter outer 
diameter, bearing outer diameter, and housing 
bore diameter follow the normal distribution. 
The residual clearance is generally calculated as 
the range of percent defective.
When each dimension and clearance follow 
the normal distribution and the percent 
defective is 0.26% (standard range = ±3σ), 
residual clearance Δ f can be represented by the 
formula below.
　∆f ＝ ∆fm ± 3σ∆f ……………………(8.3)
Where:
　　Δ fm	 : Average value of standard 
clearance, mm
　　σΔ f	: Standard deviation of residual 
clearance
For the average values and standard deviation 
of residual clearance, see Table 8.3 and Table 
8.4.

Note: When the linear expansion coefficient difference or the temperature difference of the outer ring and the housing or the inner ring and the

shaft outer diameter, and housing bore diameter before and after the expansion/contraction and then calculate the expansion rate of the 
raceway and the effective interference.

Table 8.7  Average raceway diameter (approximate expression)
(3)  Reduced internal clearance due to inner/
outer ring temperature difference.
During operation, normally the outer ring will 
range from 5 to 10°C cooler than the inner ring 
or rotating parts. However, if the cooling effect 
of the housing is large, the shaft is connected 
to a heat source, or a heated substance is 
conducted through the hollow shaft; the 
temperature difference between the two rings 
can be even greater. The amount of internal 
clearance is thus further reduced by the 
differential expansion of the two rings.
　δt = α・Δ T・Do ……………………(8.5)
　δt	 : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
temperature differential of inner and 
outer rings, mm
　α	 : Bearing material expansion coefficient 
12.5 × 10-6/°C
　Δ T	: Inner/outer ring temperature 
differential, °C
　Do	 : Outer ring raceway diameter, mm
Outer ring raceway diameter, Do, values can 
be approximated by using formula (8.6) or (8.7).
For ball bearings and spherical roller bearings,
　Do = 0.20(d + 4.0D) …………………(8.6)
For roller bearings (except spherical roller 
bearings),
　Do = 0.25(d + 3.0D) …………………(8.7)
　dw
: Bearing bore diameter, mm
　Dw
: Bearing outside diameter, mm
For the ULTAGE series bearings, consult NTN 
Engineering.
Note that the formula in item 8.2.2 only 
applies to steel bearings, shafts and housings.
“Operating clearance calculation (based 
on 3σ)” can be done by using the bearing 
technique calculation tool on the NTN website 
(https://www.ntnglobal.com).

Preload is primarily 
used to prevent 
smearing of 
opposite axial load 
side when bearing 
an axial load.
Preloading is accomplished by a 
predetermined offset of the rings 
or by using spacers.
For the standard preload see 
Table 8.18.
Preload is accomplished by 
adjusting a threaded screw.
The amount of preload is set by 
measuring the starting torque or 
axial displacement.
Preloading is accomplished by 
using coil or belleville springs.
For deep groove ball bearings: 
4 to 10 d N
d: shaft diameter (mm)
For angular contact ball bearings: 
see Table 8.18.

8.3  Preload
Normally, bearings are used with a slight internal 
clearance under operating conditions. However, 
in some applications, bearings are given an 
initial load; this means that the bearings’ 
internal clearance is negative before operation. 
This is called “preload” and is commonly applied 
to angular ball bearings and tapered roller 
bearings.
8.3.1  Purpose of preload
The following results are obtained by constant 
elastic compressive force applied to the contact 
points of rolling elements and raceway by 
providing preload.
(1) Bearing’s rigidity increases, internal 
clearance tends not to be produced even 
when heavy load is applied.
(2) The particular frequency of the bearing 
increases and is suitable for high-speed 
rotation.
(3) Shaft runout is suppressed; rotation and 
position precision are enhanced.
(4) Vibration and noise are controlled.
(5) Sliding of rolling elements by turning, 
spinning, or pivoting, is controlled and 
smearing is reduced.
(6) Fretting produced by external vibration is 
prevented.
Applying excessive preload could result in 
reduction of life, abnormal heating, or increase 
in turning torque. You should therefore 
consider the objectives before determining the 
amount of preload.
8.3.2  Preloading methods and amounts
The most common method of applying preload 
on a bearing is to change the relative position 
of the inner and outer rings of the bearing in 
the axial direction while applying an axial load 
between bearings on opposing sides. There are 
two types of preload: fixed position preload and 
constant pressure preload.
The basic pattern, purpose and characteristics 
of bearing preloads are shown in Table 8.17.
Fixed position preload
1) Fixed position preload is effective for 
positioning the two bearings and also for 
increasing the rigidity.
2) The amount of preload will change due to 
axial displacement caused by temperature 
differences between the shaft and housing 
and the inner and outer rings. Preload will 
also change as a result of displacement due 
to loads.
Constant pressure preload
1) Due to the use of a spring for the constant 
pressure preload, the preloading amount 
can be kept constant, even when the 
distance between the two bearings 
fluctuates under the influence of operating 
heat and load.
2) Axial loads cannot be applied in the 
direction in which springs are contracted.
Also, the standard preloading amount for the 
paired angular contact ball bearings is shown in 
Table 8.18. Light and normal preload is applied 
to prevent general vibration, and medium and 
heavy preload is applied especially when rigidity 
is required.
8.3.3  Preload and rigidity
The increased rigidity effect preloading has on 
bearings is shown in Fig. 8.2 to Fig. 8.4. When 
the offset inner rings of the two paired angular 
contact ball bearings are pressed together, each 
inner ring is displaced axially by the amount δo 
and is thus given a preload, Fo, in the direction. 
Under this condition, when external axial load 
Fa is applied, bearing Ⅰ will have an increased 
displacement by the amount δa and bearing 
Ⅱ will have a decreased displacement. At this 
time the loads applied to bearing Ⅰ and Ⅱ are 
FⅠ and FⅡ, respectively. Under the condition of 
no preload, bearing Ⅰ will be displaced by the 
amount δb when axial load Fa is applied. Since 
the amount of displacement, δa, is less than 
δb, it indicates a higher rigidity for δa.
If a large axial load is to be applied, care must 
be taken because the preload may be released, 
causing problems such as heat generation, 
vibration, and rigidity decrease.
Three-row combinations and two-row 
combinations are different and have unique right 
and left displacement diagrams. Figure 8.3 uses 
a two-row diagram for bearing Ⅰ, and Figure 8.4 
uses a two-row diagram for bearing Ⅱ. When 
preload Fo is applied, bearing Ⅰ is displaced by 
δ01 and bearing Ⅱ is displaced by δ02. Under 
this condition, when axial load Fa is additionally 
applied, bearing Ⅰ will have an increased 
displacement by the amount δa and bearing Ⅱ 
will have a decreased displacement.

8.4  Necessary minimum load
In general, when a bearing is operated under 
no load or a very light load, slippage may occur 
between the rolling element and the raceway 
(see “8.3.1 Purpose of preload”). In the case of 
high-speed rotation, a gyro slip or a cage slip 
may cause early damage such as smearing.  In 
this case it is necessary to apply a minimum load 
to prevent slippage during bearing operation.
A rough standard for the necessary minimum 
radial loads for radial bearings is shown below.
　Ball bearings (except self-aligning 
　ball bearings):	
: 0.023 C0r
　Self-aligning ball bearings	: 0.018 C0r
　Roller bearings	
: 0.040 C0r
Where, C0r: Basic static rating load (N)

9.1  Constant speed rotation
As the rotational speed of the bearing increases, 
the temperature of the bearing also rises due 
to heat generation inside the bearing due 
to friction. This may result in damage to the 
bearing, such as seizure, and the bearing will be 
unable to continue stable operation. Therefore, 
the maximum speed at which it is possible for 
the bearing to continuously operate without the 
generation of excessive heat beyond specified 
limits is called the allowable speed (min–1). The 
allowable speed of a bearing depends on the 
type of bearing, bearing dimensions, type of 
cage, load, lubrication conditions, and cooling 
conditions.
The bearing dimensional table gives 
approximate allowable rotational speeds for 
grease and oil lubrication.
● The bearing must have the proper 
internal clearance prescribed in the NTN 
Engineering standard design specifications 
and must be properly installed.
● A quality lubricant must be used. The 
lubricant must be replenished and changed 
when necessary.
● The bearing must be operated at normal 
operating temperature under ordinary load 
conditions (P ≦ 0.08 Cr, Fa / Fr ≦ 0.3).
If the load is below the minimum necessary 
load (see section “8. Bearing Internal Clearance 
and Preload 8.4”), rolling elements may not turn 
smoothly. If so, please contact NTN Engineering 
for more information. Allowable rotation for 
deep groove ball bearings with contact seal 
(LLU type) or low-torque seal (LLH type) is 
determined according to the circumferential 
speed of the seal. For bearings to be used 
under heavier than normal load conditions, the 
allowable speed values listed in the bearing 
tables must be multiplied by an adjustment 
factor. The adjustment factors f L and fC are 
given in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2.

9.  Allowable speed
Also, when radial bearings are mounted on 
vertical shafts, retention of lubricant and cage 
guidance are less favorable when compared 
to horizontal shaft mounting. Therefore, 
the allowable speed should be reduced to 
approximately 80% of the listed speed. For 
speeds other than those mentioned above, and 
for which data is incomplete, please consult 
NTN Engineering.
If rotational speed is to exceed allowable 
rotational speed given in the dimensions table, 
it will require special considerations, such as 
using a bearing for which cage specifications, 
internal clearance and precision have been 
thoroughly checked. It may require adopting 
forced circulation, jet oil or mist oil lubrication as 
the lubrication method.
Under such high speed operating conditions, 
when special care is taken, the standard 
allowable speeds given in the bearing tables 
can be adjusted upward. The maximum speed 
adjustment values, f B, by which the bearing 
table speeds can be multiplied, are shown in 
Table 9.1. However, for any application requiring 
speeds in excess of the standard allowable 
speed, please consult NTN Engineering.
Polylube bearings (see section 11.4) have 
their original allowable rotational speed 
provision. For details, see the special catalogs 
“Polylube bearing (CAT. No. 3022/E)” and 
“Polylube needle bearing (CAT. No. 3605/J).”
9.2  Low-speed rotation and rapid 
acceleration/deceleration
When the bearing rotational speed is 
particularly low (the product of the rotational 
speed n (min–1) and the rolling element pitch 
diameter Dpw (mm) is Dpw n < 10 000), an 
elastohydrodynamic lubrication oil film may not 
be formed at the contact surface between the 
rolling element and the raceway surface.
Under such conditions, lubricant containing an 
extreme-pressure additive (EP additive) should 
be used.
When rapid acceleration/deceleration is 
included in the operating conditions, the cage 
may break.
Please contact NTN Engineering because 
the allowable rotational speed needs to be 
examined individually.
9.3  Oscillating applications
In small oscillating movement, the rotation 
direction changes before the bearing makes one 
rotation. 
The moment when the rotation method 
forwards and reverses, the rotational speed 
becomes zero. At this time, a lubrication oil film 
in the fluid mechanics may not be formed or 
maintained.
Under such conditions, lubricant containing an 
extreme-pressure additive (EP additive) should 
be used.
Suitable preload may be applied to reduce the 
sliding of rolling elements.
When the oscillation angle is extremely small, 
an oil film is unlikely to be formed on the contact 
surface between the raceway surface and the 
rolling element, and fretting (slight abrasion) 
may occur.
Please contact NTN Engineering because 
the allowable rotational speed needs to be 
examined individually.

9.4  Heat rating rotational speed
The heat rating rotational speed is an index 
standardized in JIS B 1550:2010 (ISO 
15312:2003) that uses bearing operating 
temperature as reference.
This standard refers to the rotational speed 
of the inner ring of the bearing when the heat 
generation amount due to the bearing internal 
friction becomes equivalent to the heat radiation 
amount of the shaft and housing for mounting 
the bearing in the case where the bearing is 
operated at the reference condition below.
Reference conditions are shown below.
(1) Reference temperature
 Reference temperature of static outer ring 
(housing raceway washer): 70°C
 Reference ambient temperature around 
bearing: 20°C
(2) Reference load
Radial bearing (0° ≦ α ≦ 45°):
　Pure radial load of 0.05 × C0r
Thrust roller bearing (45° ≦ α ≦ 90°):
　Pure axial load of 0.02 × C0a
(3) Lubricant
The lubricant must be mineral oil that 
is free of an extreme-pressure additive 
and have viscosity ν below the following 
values at 70°C.
Radial bearing:
　ν = 12 mm2/s (equivalent to ISO VG32)
Thrust roller bearing:
　ν = 24 mm2/s (equivalent to ISO VG68)
(4) Lubrication method
In oil bath lubrication, the oil level is the 
center of the rolling element that is at the 
lowermost position.
Refer to JIS B 1550:2010 (ISO 15312:2003) 
for further details.

●Friction and Temperature Rise
A-109
10.1  Friction
One of the main functions required of a bearing 
is that it must have low friction. Under normal 
operating conditions rolling bearings have a 
much smaller friction coefficient than sliding 
bearings, especially when comparing starting 
friction.
The friction coefficient for rolling bearings is 
expressed by formula (10.1).
　　μ =  2M   ………………………… (10.1)
　          Pd
Where:
　μ : Friction coefficient
　M : Friction moment, N・mm
　P : Load, N
　d : Bearing bore, mm
The dynamic friction coefficient for rolling 
bearings varies with the type of bearing, load, 
lubrication, speed, and other factors. For normal 
operating conditions, the approximate friction 
coefficients for various bearing types are listed 
in Table 10.1.

10.  Friction and temperature rise
10.2  Temperature rise
Almost all friction loss in a bearing is 
transformed into heat within the bearing itself 
and causes the temperature of the bearing to 
rise. The amount of thermal generation caused 
by the friction moment can be calculated using 
formula (10.2).
　Q = 0.105×10−6 M × n  ……………(10.2)
Where:
　Q : Thermal value, kW
　M : Friction moment, N・mm
　n : Rotational speed, min–1
Bearing operating temperature is determined 
by the equilibrium or balance between the 
amount of heat generated by the bearing and 
the amount of heat conducted away from the 
bearing. In most cases the temperature rises 
sharply during initial operation, then increases 
slowly until it reaches a stable condition and 
then remains constant. The time it takes to 
reach this steady state depends on the amount 
of heat produced, heat capacity/diffusion of 
the shaft and housing, amount of lubricant 
and method of lubrication. If the temperature 
continues to rise and does not become constant, 
it must be assumed that there is some improper 
function.
When any abnormal temperature rise is 
observed, examine the equipment. Remove 
the bearing for inspection if necessary. Some 
possible causes of abnormal temperature rises 
would be as follows.
•  Bearing misalignment (due to moment load 
or incorrect installation)
• Insufficient internal clearance
• Excessive preload
• Amount of lubricant too small or large
• Unsuitable lubricant
• Heat generated from sealing mechanism
• Excessive load
• Rapid acceleration and deceleration
• Heat conducted from external sources

10.3  Starting torque calculation
The starting torque refers to the torque 
generated at the time of initial bearing rotation, 
and the torque generation factor differs 
between ball bearings and roller bearings. For 
ball bearings, this calculation is shown below 
with an angular contact ball bearing.  For roller 
bearings, a tapered roller bearing is used as an 
example.
Even if the actual starting torque value is the 
same number, the torque calculation value is a 
reference value because there is measurement 
variation for each bearing.
1)  Preload and staring torque of angular 
contact ball bearings
Bearings having a contact angle such as angular 
contact ball bearings and tapered roller bearings 
cannot be used by themselves. Two bearings 
must face each other or be used in combination. 
In this case, the bearings are often used by 
applying a preload, and the larger the preload 
is, the larger the friction torque of the bearing 
becomes. The starting torque of the angular 
contact ball bearing when a preload is applied 
generates the majority of the spin slip and the 
rolling friction torque.
The relationship between the preload and the 
starting torque of angular contact ball bearings 
is not a simple proportional relationship, and 
the calculation is complicated; therefore, please 
contact NTN Engineering.
2)  Preload and starting torque of tapered 
roller bearings
The starting torque of tapered roller bearings are 
influenced by the following factors.
(1)  Sliding friction between roller large end 
surface and inner ring large rib surface
(2) Rolling friction of rolling surface
(3) Sliding friction of roller and cage
Figure 10.2 shows calculation examples. For 
details, please contact NTN Engineering.
(4) Stirring resistance of lubricant
However, (2) to (4) are extremely small 
compared with (1); therefore, the starting 
torque of tapered roller bearings is calculated 
by (1).
Starting torque M of tapered roller bearings is 
represented by formula (10.3).

　M =μ・e・cos (β/2)・Fa     Ｎ・ｍｍ …(10.3)
　　M : Starting torque, N・mm

11.  Lubrication
11.1  Purpose of lubrication
The purpose of rolling bearing lubrication is to 
prevent direct metallic contact between the 
various rolling and sliding elements. This is 
accomplished through the formation of a thin 
oil (or grease) film on the contact surfaces. 
Lubricant is necessary for operating rolling 
bearings. For rolling bearings, lubrication has the 
following advantages:
(1)  Reduction of friction and wear 
It prevents direct metallic contact between 
the rolling and sliding elements of bearing 
components and reduces friction and 
wear.
(2)  Prolonged bearing life 
The rolling fatigue life is prolonged by 
forming an oil film on the rolling contact 
surface part.
(3)  Friction heat dissipation and cooling 
circulating lubrication can dissipate heat 
generated from friction or conducted from 
the outside.
(4)  Others 
It prevents foreign materials from 
entering inside the bearing and 
suppresses corrosion (rust) by covering 
the bearing surface with oil.
In order to exhibit these effects, a lubrication 
method that matches service conditions is 
required. In addition to this, a quality lubricant 
must be selected, the proper amount of 
lubricant must be used and the bearing must 
be designed to prevent foreign matter from 
getting in or lubricant from leaking out. If 
lubrication is insufficient, friction is not reduced, 
causing excessive rise in bearing temperature 
or abnormal wear. Therefore, an appropriate 
lubrication and lubrication method should be 
selected.

Lubrication method
When oil volume is extremely 
low, direct metallic contact 
occurs in places between the 
rolling elements and raceway 
surfaces. Bearing abrasion and 
seizing may occur.
A thin oil film develops over all 
surfaces, friction is minimal 
and bearing temperature is 
low.
As oil volume increases, heat 
buildup is balanced by cooling.
Regardless of oil volume, 
temperature increases at a 
fixed rate.
As oil volume increases, 
cooling dominates and bearing 
temperature decreases.

Table 11.2  Comparison of grease lubrication 
and oil lubrication characteristics
11.2  Lubrication methods and 
characteristics
Lubrication methods for bearings can be roughly 
divided into grease and oil lubrication. Each of 
these has its own features, so the lubrication 
method that best offers the required function 
must be selected.
Characteristics of each method are shown in 
Table 11.2.
11.3  Grease lubrication
Grease lubricants are relatively easy to handle 
and require only the simplest sealing devices. 
For these reasons, grease is the most widely 
used lubricant for rolling bearings. It is used in a 
bearing that is pre-sealed with grease (sealed/
shielded bearing), or if using an unsealed 
bearing, fill the bearing and housing with the 
proper amount of grease, and replenish or 
change the grease regularly.
With sealed bearings, the proper grease 
amount does not cause leakage; however, under 
use conditions including a lot of vibrations, 
which cause grease to flow easily, or under 
high-speed outer ring rotation, in which large 
centrifugal force is applied on the grease, the 
grease may purge (in rare cases). Please consult 
NTN Engineering.
11.3.1  Types and characteristics of grease
Lubricating grease is composed of either a 
mineral base oil or a synthetic base oil. To 
this base a thickener and other additives are 
added. The properties of all greases are mainly 
determined by the kind of base oil used and 
by the combination of thickening agent and 
various additives. Table 11.5 shows general 
grease varieties and characteristics, and Table 
11.6 shows grease brand names and their 
characteristics. (See pages A-116 and A-117.) 
As performance characteristics of even the 
same type of grease will vary widely from 
brand to brand, it is necessary to check the 
manufacturers’ data when selecting grease.
(1) Base oil 
Mineral oil or synthetics such as ester oil, 
synthetic hydrocarbon oil, or ether oil are 
used as the base of greases. 
　Generally, greases with low viscosity 
base oils are best suited for low 
temperatures and high speeds; grease 
using high-viscosity base oil has superior 
high-temperature and high-load 
characteristics.
(2) Thickening agents 
Thickening agents are compounded with 
base oils to maintain the semi-solid state 
of the grease. Thickening agents consist 
of two types of bases: metallic soaps 
and non-soaps. Metallic soap thickeners 
include: lithium, sodium, calcium, etc. 
Non-soap base thickeners are divided 
into two groups: inorganic (silica gel, 
bentonite, etc.) and organic (polyurea, 
fluorocarbon, etc.). The various special 
characteristics of a grease, such as 
limiting temperature range, mechanical 
stability, water resistance, etc. depend 
largely on the type of thickening agent 
used. For example, a sodium based grease 
is generally poor in water resistance 
properties, while greases with bentone, 
poly-urea and other non-metallic soaps as 
the thickening agent are generally superior 
in high temperature properties.
(3) Additives 
Various additives are added to grease 
depending on the purpose. Typical 
additives include anti-oxidants, high-
pressure additives (EP additives), rust 
preventives, and anti-corrosives. For 
bearings subject to heavy loads and/
or shock loads, grease containing high-
pressure additives should be used. Anti-
oxidants are added to grease used in most 
types of rolling bearings.
(4) Consistency 
Consistency is an index that indicates 
hardness and fluidity of grease. The 
higher the NLGI number, the HARDER 
the grease is. For the lubrication of 
rolling bearings, greases with the NLGI 
consistency numbers of 1, 2, and 3 are 
used. General relationships between 
consistency and application of grease are 
shown in Table 11.3.

(5) Mixing different types of greases 
When greases of different kinds are mixed 
together, the consistency of the greases 
will change (usually softer), the operating 
temperature range will be lowered, and 
other changes in characteristics will occur. 
As a rule, grease should not be mixed 
with grease of any other brand. However, 
if different greases must be mixed, at 
least greases with the same base oil and 
thickening agent should be selected.

11.3.2  Amount of grease
The amount of grease used in any given 
situation will depend on many factors relating 
to the size and shape of the housing, space 
limitations, bearing’s rotating speed and type 
of grease used. As a rule of thumb, bearings 
should be filled to 30 to 40% of their space 
and housing should be filled 30 to 60%. Where 
speeds are high and temperature rises need 
to be kept to a minimum, a reduced amount 
of grease should be used. Excessive amounts 
of grease cause temperature rises which 
in turn cause the grease to soften and may 
allow leakage. Oxidation and deterioration of 
excessive grease fills may cause the lubricating 
efficiency to be lowered. Moreover, the 
standard bearing space can be found by formula 
(11.1)
　V ＝ K ・ W …………………………… (11.1)
where,
　　V	 : Quantity of bearing space open type 
(approx.), cm3
　　K	 : Bearing space factor (see value of K in 
Table 11.4)
　　W	: Mass of bearing, kg
A predetermine amount of grease is filled in 
the bearing with a grease gun or a syringe. After 
sealing it is not possible  to spread the grease by 
hand - only by rotating the bearing by hand.

From Fig. 9.1 Cr / Pr = 21.6 / 2.0 kN = 10.8, 
fL = 0.96. Allowable rotational speed from the 
dimensions tables for bearing 6206 is 11 000 
min–1. Allowable rotational speed no for 2.0 kN 
radial load is:
　no = 0.96 × 11 000 = 10 560min−1
Therefore,  no  = 10 560  = 2.93
                     n        3 600
The point where vertical line Ⅰ intersects a 
horizontal line drawn from the point equivalent 
of d = 30 for the radial ball bearing shown in Fig. 
11.2 shall be point A. Find intersection point C 
where vertical line Ⅲ intersects the straight line 
formed by joining point B (no / n = 2.93) with A 
by a straight line Ⅱ. It shows that grease life in 
this case is approximately 5,500 hours.
11.3.4  Grease life estimation of sealed ball 
bearings
There is a method of estimating the grease life 
of single row sealed and greased ball bearings.
The estimated grease life changes depending 
on the grease type, temperature, shaft rotational 
speed, and load; therefore, please contact NTN 
Engineering for details.
11.4  Solid grease
“Solid grease” is a lubricant composed mainly 
of lubricating grease and ultra-high polymer 
polyethylene. Solid grease begins as grease that 
has the same viscosity as a more traditional 
grease. After being heated and cooled, a process 
known a “calcination”, the grease hardens 
while maintaining a large quantity of lubricant 
within the polymer structure. The result of this 
solidification is that the grease does not easily 
leak from the bearing, even when the bearing is 
subjected to strong vibrations or centrifugal force.

11.3.3  Grease replenishment
As the lubricating performance of grease 
declines with the time, grease must be filled in 
proper intervals.
The replenishment interval depends on the 
type of bearing, dimensions, bearing’s rotating 
speed, bearing temperature, and type of grease. 
An easy reference chart for calculating grease 
replenishment interval is shown in Fig. 11.2. 
This chart indicates the replenishment interval 
for standard rolling bearing grease when used 
under normal operating conditions. As operating 
temperatures increase, the grease interval 
should be shortened accordingly. Generally, for 
every 10°C increase in bearing temperature 
above 80°C, the grease interval period is 
shortened to “2/3”.
For grease replenishment interval of the 
ULTAGE series, please contact NTN Engineering.
Bearings with solid grease are available in two 
types: the spot-pack type in which solid grease 
is injected into the cage, and the full-pack 
type in which all free space around the rolling 
elements is completely filled with solid grease.
Spot-pack solid grease is available for deep 
groove ball bearings, small diameter ball bearings, 
and bearing units. Full-pack solid grease is 
available for self-aligning ball bearings, spherical 
roller bearings, and needle roller bearings.
Primary advantages:
(1) Minimal grease leakage
(2) Low bearing torque with spot-pack type 
solid grease

Lubrication method
Example
¡In this method, the 
required minimum 
amount of lubricating oil 
is measured and fed to 
each bearing at ideal 
intervals using 
compressed air.
¡Fresh lubricating oil is 
constantly fed.
¡Because the required oil 
quantity is very small, the 
working environment can 
be kept clean.
Lubrication method
Example
(Air-oil lubrication)
¡This method lubricates 
by injecting oil under 
high pressure directly 
into the side of the 
bearing. This is a reliable 
system for high speed, 
high temperature or 
otherwise severe 
conditions.
¡Used for lubricating the 
bearings in jet engines, 
gas turbines, and other 
high speed equipment.
¡Under-race lubrication is 
one example of this type 
of lubrication.
(Oil jet lubrication)
¡Using pressurized air, 
lubricating oil is 
atomized before passing 
through the bearing.
¡Due to the low lubricant 
resistance, this method 
is well suited to high 
speed applications.
(Oil mist lubrication)
¡In this method, a partially 
submerged disc rotates 
and pulls oil up into a 
reservoir from which it 
then drains down 
through the bearing, 
lubricating it.
(Disc lubrication)
¡In this method, oil is collected 
above the bearing and allowed 
to drip down into the housing 
where it becomes a lubricating 
mist as it strikes the rolling 
elements. Another version 
allows only slight amounts of oil 
to pass through the bearing.
¡Used at relatively high speeds 
for light to moderate load 
applications.
¡In most cases, oil volume is a 
few drops per minute.
(Drip lubrication)
¡Used for bearing cooling or for 
automatic oil supply systems in 
which the oil supply is centrally 
located.
¡One of the advantages of this 
method is that oil cooling 
devices and filters to maintain 
oil purity can be installed within 
the system.
¡In order for oil to thoroughly 
lubricate the bearing, oil inlets 
and outlets must be provided 
on opposite sides of the 
bearing.
(Circulating lubrication)
¡In this method, an impeller or 
similar device mounted on the 
shaft draws up oil and sprays it 
onto the bearing. This method 
can be used at considerably 
high speeds.
(Oil spray lubrication)
¡Oil bath lubrication is the most 
generally used method of 
lubrication, and is widely used 
for low to moderate rotational 
speed applications.
¡For horizontal shaft 
applications, oil level should be 
maintained at approximately 
the center of the lowest rolling 
element, according to the oil 
gauge, when the bearing is at 
rest. For vertical shafts at low 
speeds, oil level should be 
maintained at 50 - 80% 
submergence of the rolling 
elements.

Table 11.7  Oil lubrication methods
11.5.  Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication is suitable for applications 
requiring that bearing-generated heat or heat 
applied to the bearing from other sources be 
carried away from the bearing and dissipated to 
the outside.
Table 11.7 shows the main methods of oil 
lubrication.
11.5.1  Selection of lubricating oil
Under normal operating conditions, machine 
oil, turbine oil, and other mineral oils are widely 
used for the lubrication of rolling bearings. 
However, for temperatures below -30°C or 
above 150°C, synthetic oils such as ester oil, 
silicone oil, and fluorinated oil are used.
For lubricating oils, viscosity is one of the 
most important properties and determines 
an oil’s lubricating efficiency. If viscosity is too 
low, formation of the oil film will be insufficient, 
and damage to the rolling surface will occur. 
If viscosity is too high, viscous resistance will 
also be great, resulting in temperature increase 
and friction loss. In general, for higher speed 
applications, a lower viscosity oil should be 
used; for heavier load applications, a higher 
viscosity oil should be used.
Lubrication of rolling bearings requires 
viscosity shown in Table 11.8, which is 
dependent on the use conditions. Fig 11.5 
shows the relation between lubricating oil 
viscosity and temperature. This is used to select 
a lubrication oil with viscosity characteristics 
appropriate for the operating temperature.
For reference, Table 11.9 lists the selection 
standards for lubricating oil viscosity based on 
bearing operating conditions.

2. Please consult NTN Engineering in cases where operating conditions fall outside the range covered by this table.
11.5.3  Relubrication intervals
The intervals at which lubricating oil should 
be changed varies depending upon operating 
conditions, oil quantity, and type of oil used. 
In general, for oil bath lubrication where the 
operating temperature is 50°C or less, oil 
should be replaced once a year. When the 
operating temperature is between 80°C - 
100°C, oil should be replaced at least once 
every three months. For important equipment, 
it is advisable that lubricating efficiency and 
oil purity deterioration be checked regularly to 
determine when oil replacement is necessary.
(Example) For tapered roller bearing 
30220U mounted on a flywheel shaft with 
a radial load of 9.5 kN, operating at 1 800 
min–1, what is the amount of lubricating oil 
Q required to keep the bearing temperature 
rise below 15°C?
　d = 100mm，
　dn = 100 × 1 800 = 18 × 104
From Fig. 11.6　q = 180cm3／min
Assume the bearing temperature is 
approximately equal to the expelled oil 
temperature,
from Table 11.10, since K = 1
　Q = K × q = 1 × 180 = 180cm3／min
11.5.2  Oiling amount
When a bearing is to be supplied with oil 
forcibly, the amount of heat generated from 
the bearing is equal to the sum of the amount 
of heat dissipated from the housing and the 
amount of heat carried away by the oil.
The oiling amount that serves as a rough 
indication when a standard housing is used can 
be obtained by formula (11.2).
Q = K ∙ q ………………………………(11.2)
where,
　Q: oiling amount per bearing (cm3/min)
　K: coefficient determined by allowable 
temperature rise of oil (Table 11.10)
　q: oiling amount obtained by diagram  
(cm3/min) (Fig. 11.6)
The heat dissipation amount differs depending 
on the housing type. Therefore, in the actual 
operation, it is desirable to obtain the oiling 
amount suitable for the actual machine by 
adjusting the amount obtained by formula 
(11.2) to 1.5 to 2 times.
In addition, when calculating the oiling 
amount assuming that no heat is dissipated 
from the housing and the generated heat

●External Bearing Sealing Devices
●External Bearing Sealing Devices
A-124
A-125
External seals have two main functions: to 
prevent lubricating oil from leaking out of 
the bearing, and to prevent dust, water, and 
other contaminants from entering inside the 
bearing. When selecting a seal, the following 
factors should be considered, in addition to 
the application's operating conditions:  Type 
of lubricant (oil or grease), seal lip speed, shaft 
misalignment, space limitations, seal friction and 
heat generation, and cost.
Sealing devices for rolling bearings fall into 
two main classifications: non-contact seals and 
contact seals.
● Non-contact seals: Non-contact seals utilize 
a small clearance between the shaft and the 
housing, or between the shaft and sealing 
apparatus. Therefore friction is negligible, 
making them suitable for high speed 
applications. 
　In order to improve sealing capability, the 
gaps between the shaft and sealing apparatus 
are often filled with lubricant.
● Contact seals: A contact seal is a seal in 
which a molded synthetic rubber lip on a steel 
plate is pressed against the shaft. Contact 
seals are generally far superior to non-contact 
seals in sealing effectiveness, although 
their friction torque and temperature rise 
coefficients are higher. Furthermore, because 
the lip portion of a contact seal slides while in 
contact with the shaft, the allowable lip speed 
may vary based on the seal design. 
　The surface at which the seal lip contacts 
the shaft must be lubricated. Ordinary bearing 
lubricant can also be used for this purpose. 
　Table 12.1 lists the special characteristics 
of seals and other points to be considered 
when choosing an appropriate seal.

Seal characteristics and selection considerations
Cautionary points regarding selection
This is an simple seal design 
with a small radial clearance 
between the shaft and 
housing.
Several concentric oil grooves 
are provided on the housing 
inner diameter to improve the 
sealing effectiveness. When 
the grooves are filled with 
lubricant, the ingress of 
external contaminants is 
prevented.
Oil grooves are provided on 
both the shaft outer diameter 
and housing inner diameter 
for a seal with even greater 
sealing effectiveness.
This seal has a labyrinth 
passageway on the axial side 
of the housing.
A labyrinth passageway is 
located on the radial side of 
the housing.
For use with split housings.
This offers better sealing 
effectiveness than axial 
labyrinth seals.
The seal’s labyrinth 
passageway is slanted and 
has sufficient clearance to 
prevent contact between the 
housing projections and the 
shaft, even as the shaft 
realigns.
・In order to improve sealing effectiveness, 
clearances between the shaft and housing 
should be minimized. However, care should 
be taken to confirm shaft/bearing rigidity and 
other factors to avoid direct contact between 
the shaft and housing during operation.
・In order to improve sealing effectiveness, 
labyrinth passageway clearances should be 
minimized. However, care should be taken to 
confirm shaft/bearing rigidity, fit, internal 
clearances and other factors to avoid direct 
contact between labyrinth projections during 
operation.
・Sealing effectiveness can be further improved 
by filling the labyrinth passageway with 
grease of which ASTM worked penetration is 
150 to 200.
・Labyrinth seals are suitable for high speed 
applications.
・Oil groove width, depth (reference)
　　　Width: 2 to 5 mm
　　　Depth: 4 to 5 mm
・Three or more oil grooves should be provided.
・Sealing effectiveness can be further improved 
by filling the oil groove portion with grease of 
which ASTM worked penetration is 150 to 200.
・Grease is generally used as the lubricant for 
labyrinth seals, and, except in low speed 
applications, is commonly used together with 
other sealing devices.

makes its way out of the housing 
along the shaft is thrown off by 
projections on the oil comb 
sleeve and recirculated.
Seal type whereby a slinger is 
provided in the housing that 
prevents lubricant from leaking 
by centrifugal force produced via 
rotation.
By mounting a slinger on the 
outside of the housing, 
centrifugal force helps to 
prevent dust and other solid 
contaminants from entering.
Cautionary points regarding selection
・Seal type that utilizes centrifugal 
force of the slinger mounted on 
rotating shaft.
・If mounted on the inside of the 
housing, the slinger should function 
to seal in lubricant by the 
centrifugal force produced by 
rotation.
・If mounted on the outside of the 
housing, the slinger should function 
to seal out foreign matter by the fan 
effect produced by rotation.
・These seal types are commonly 
employed together with other 
sealing devices.
In cross section resembling the letter “Z”; this seal’s empty spaces are filled 
with grease.
The seal is commonly used with a plummer block (housing).
This design enhances sealing efficiency with a lip that seals from the axial 
direction. With the aid of centrifugal force, this seal also offers effective 
protection against dust, water, and other contaminants entering the bearing.
Can be used for both oil and grease lubrication.
At seal peripheral speeds in excess of 12 m/s, seal ring fit is lost due to 
centrifugal force, and a clamping band is necessary to hold it in place.

Seal type/material
Oil seals are widely used, and their 
shapes and dimensions are 
standardized under JIS B 2402.
In this design, a ring-shaped spring 
is installed in the lip section. As a 
result, contact pressure is exerted 
between the lip edge and shaft 
surface, and sealing effectiveness is 
good.
When the bearing and oil seal are in 
close proximity, the internal 
clearance of the bearing may be 
reduced by heat produced by the oil 
seal. In addition to considering the 
heat generated by contact seals at 
various peripheral speeds, internal 
bearing clearances must also be 
selected with caution.
Depending on its orientation, the 
seal may function to prevent 
lubricant from leaking out or foreign 
matter from getting in.

13.1  Raceway and rolling element
While the contact surfaces of a bearing’s 
raceways and rolling elements are subjected to 
repeated heavy stress, they must also maintain 
high precision and rotational accuracy.
To accomplish this, the raceways and rolling 
elements must be made of a material that has 
high hardness, is resistant to rolling fatigue, 
is wear resistant, and has good dimensional 
stability. The most common cause of fatigue 
in bearings is the inclusion of non-metallic 
inclusions in the steel. Nonmetallic inclusions 
contain hard oxides that can cause fatigue 
cracks. Clean steel with minimal non-metallic 
inclusions must therefore be used.
All NTN bearings use steel that is low in 
oxygen content and nonmetallic impurities, 
refined by a vacuum degassing process and 
outside hearth smelting. For bearings requiring 
especially high reliability and long life, steels of 
even higher in purity, such as vacuum melted 
steel (VIM / VAR) and electro-slag melted steel 
(ESR), are used.
13.1.1  Raceway and rolling element materials
1) High/mid carbon alloy steel
In general, steel types capable of being 
“through hardened” below the material 
surface are employed for raceways and rolling 
elements. Foremost among these is high carbon 
chromium bearing steel, which is widely used. 
For large type bearings and bearings with large 
cross sectional dimensions, induction hardened 
bearing steel is used, which incorporates 
manganese(Mn) or molybdenum(Mo). 
Midcarbon chromium steel incorporating 
silicon(Si) and manganese may also be used, 
which gives it hardening properties comparable 
to high carbon chromium steel.
Table 13.1 (A-140) gives the chemical 
composition of representative high carbon 
chrome bearing steels that meet JIS G 4805. 
SUJ2 is frequently used. SUJ3, with enhanced 
hardening characteristics containing a large 
quantity of Mn, is used for large bearings. SUJ5 
is SUJ3 to which Mo has been added to further 
enhance hardening characteristics, and is used 
for oversized bearings or bearings with thick 
walls.
Table 13.1 (A-140) lists the chemical 
composition of the primary materials that 
are equivalent or similar to these JIS high 
carbon chrome bearing steels. The chemical 
composition of JIS SUJ2 is nearly equivalent to 
that of AISI, SAE standard 52100, German DIN 
standard 100Cr6, and Chinese GB standard 
GCr15.
2) Carburizing (case hardened) steel
Carburizing hardens the steel from the surface 
to the proper depth, leaving a relatively soft 
core. This provides hardness and toughness, 
making the material suitable for impact loads. 
NTN uses carburizing (case hardened) steel for 
most of its tapered roller bearings. In terms of 
case hardened steel for NTN’s other bearings, 
chromium steel and chrome molybdenum steel 
are used for small to medium sized bearings, 
and nickel chrome molybdenum steel is used for 
large sized bearings. Table 13.2 (A-141) shows 
the chemical composition of representative 
carburizing steels of JIS.
The table lists the chemical composition of 
similar materials. The chemical composition 
of JIS SCM420 is nearly equivalent to that of 
AISI, SAE standard 4118, German DIN standard 
20CrMo4 or 25CrMo4. Chinese GB standard 
has a slightly different amount of Cr and Mo 
compared with G20CrMo.
13.  Bearing materials
3) High temperature capable bearing steel
When bearings made of ordinary high carbon 
chromium steel which have undergone standard 
heat treatment are used for long durations 
at high temperatures, unacceptably large 
dimensional changes can occur as described 
in section 13.1.2. For this reason, a dimension 
stabilizing treatment (TS treatment) has been 
devised for very high temperature applications. 
This treatment however reduces the hardness 
of the material, thereby reducing rolling fatigue 
life. (See section “3.3.2 Bearing characteristics 
factor a2” on page A-22.) Note that dimensional 
changes can occur in normal use too.
Standard high temperature bearings for use at 
temperatures from 150°C - 200°C, add silicon to 
the steel to improve heat resistance. This results 
in a bearing with excellent rolling fatigue life 
with minimal dimensional change or softening at 
high temperatures.
A variety of heat resistant steels are also 
incorporated in bearings to minimize softening 
and dimensional changes when used at high 
temperatures. Two of these are high-speed 
molybdenum steel and high-speed tungsten 
steel. For bearings requiring heat resistance 
in high speed applications, there is also heat 
resistant case hardened molybdenum steel (see 
Table 13.3 on A-142).
4) Corrosion resistant bearing steel
For applications requiring high corrosion 
resistance, stainless steel is used. To achieve 
this corrosion resistance, a large proportion 
of the alloying element chrome is added to 
martensitic stainless steel (Table 13.4 on 
A-142).
5) Induction hardened steel
Besides the use of surface hardening steel, 
induction hardening is also utilized for bearing 
raceway surfaces, and for this purpose mid-
carbon steel is mainly used for its lower carbon 
content instead of through hardening steel. 
Table 13.5 (A-142) shows the chemical 
composition of the primary materials that are 
similar to the representative medium carbon 
steels (machine structural carbon steels) of JIS 
used for small products. For deep hardened 
layers required for larger bearings and 
bearings with large surface dimensions, mid-
carbon steel is fortified with chromium and 
molybdenum.
6) Other bearing materials
For ultra high speed applications and 
applications requiring very high level corrosion 
resistance, ceramic bearing materials such as 
Si3N4 are also available.

bearing Materials
1) Physical and mechanical properties of 
bearing materials (besides resin)
Table 13.6 and Table 13.7 (A-143) show 
physical and mechanical properties of the 
representative materials used for raceways, 
rolling elements, and cages.
2) Dimensional change of bearings
Dimensions of bearings used for a long time may 
change depending on the use condition. This 
phenomenon is called dimensional change.
<Mechanism of dimensional change>
A standard bearing steel structure contains a 
small amount of austenite in the matrix of hard 
martensite. This austenite is partially retained 
austenite without being transformed into 
martensite in the cooling process of the bearing 
steel quenching process, and is called residual 
austenite.
Since the residual austenite is an unstable 
structure, it is transformed into a stable 
structure (martensite) when the bearing is being 
used. This structure transformation is the cause 
of the dimensional change of bearings.
Fig. 13.1 shows measured values of 
dimensional change of a standard bearing held 
at 120°C over an extended period of time.
The dimensional change rate becomes larger 
as the elapsed time or the temperature of 
exposure increases.
Depending on the use condition, dimensional 
change may occur with bearings made of 
general bearing steel that did not reach 100°C, 
which is the normal limit.
Bearings that underwent dimension 
stabilization treatment (TS treatment) have 
a significantly lower dimensional change. For 
details, please contact NTN Engineering.
<Dimensional change problems and 
countermeasures>
Among dimensional change, particular attention 
should be paid to inner ring expansion. 
When the inner ring expands by dimensional 
change, the interference between the inner 
ring and the shaft decreases, and the bearing 
may be heavily damaged by creeping or axial 
movement. Therefore, when a bearing is to be 
used for a long time, the bearing specifications 
and fixing method must be determined with 
the interference decrease due to dimensional 
change taken into consideration. For example, 
the interference can be increased (see section 
“7. Bearing fits”) or fixing in the axial direction 
can be reinforced (see section “14. Shaft and 
housing design”).
<Situations to monitor dimensional change>
The dimensional change of bearings is expressed 
by the bearing dimension × dimensional change 
rate. Therefore, under a given temperature and 
elapsed time, larger bearings show greater 
dimensional change. Pay particular attention to 
the amount of dimensional change when large 
bearings are to be used with fits with small 
interference.
In addition, dimensional change does not 
occur during the rotation inspection immediately 
following bearing installation. It is observed after 
a long-period operation. Therefore, for machines 
and parts used for a long time, periodic inspection 
is effective for preventing problems. For detailed 
consideration, please consult NTN beforehand.
13.2  Cage
Bearing cage materials must have the strength 
to withstand rotational vibrations and shock 
loads. These materials must also have a low 
friction coefficient, be lightweight, and be able 
to withstand bearing operating temperatures.
13.2.1  Metal materials
For small and medium sized bearings, pressed 
steel cages of cold or hot rolled material
 with a low carbon content of approx. 0.1% are 
used. However, depending on the application, 
austenitic stainless steel is also used. Machined 
cages are generally used for large bearings. 
Carbon steel for machine structures or high-
strength cast brass is frequently used for the 
cages, but other materials such as aluminum 
alloy are also used. Table 13.8 and Table 13.9 
(A-143) show the chemical composition of the 
representative cage materials.
Besides high-strength brass, medium carbon 
nickel, chrome and molybdenum steel that 
has been hardened and tempered at high 
temperatures are also used for bearings used 
in aircraft. The materials are often plated with 
silver to enhance lubrication characteristics.
13.2.2  Resin materials
Recently resin cages are used in place of 
metals because the material is lightweight and 
easy to mold into complicated shapes. On the 
other hand, resins have disadvantages such as 
lower strength and heat resistance. Therefore, 
it is important to select resin materials that 
take advantage of their characteristics. Table 
13.10 (A-144) shows the characteristics of 
the representative cage resin materials. These 
materials are rarely used without being filled, 
and are usually reinforced with glass fiber (GF) 
or carbon fiber (CF).
<<Polyamide (PA): 66, 46>>
Polyamide is suitable for general cage materials 
because it is low cost and has high strength, heat 
resistance, wear resistance, and formability. This 
material has disadvantages such as high water 
absorbency, physical property deterioration and 
dimensional change due to water absorption. 
On the other hand, water absorption increases 
flexibility and toughness, enhancing the ease 
of assembly and shock resistance of cages. 
However, the physical property (strength) 
may deteriorate rapidly at high temperatures 
when polyamide is exposed to lubricating oil 
containing an S (suflur) type or P (phosphorus) 
type extreme pressure additive. 
Polyamide 66 reinforced with glass fibers is 
the most used material because it has excellent 
performance as a cage material.
<<Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)>>
Polyphenylene sulfide has high heat resistance 
(continuous operating temperature: 220 to 
240°C), chemical resistance, melt fluidity, and 
formability.
<<Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)>>
Polyetheretherketone has the highest heat 
resistance among thermoplastic resins 
(continuous operating temperature: 240 
to 260°C). It has excellent self-lubricating 
(Advantages)
• Lightweight
• High corrosion 
resistance
• High self-lubricating 
performance with less 
abrasion powder
• Low noise
• Can easily be molded 
into complicated 
shapes and various 
designs 
• High productivity
(Disadvantages)
• Lower strength compared with 
metal
• Lower heat resistance 
compared with metal
• The strength and elastic 
modulus largely vary widely 
with temperature.
• The physical properties 
(strength) may change when 
resins are exposed to high 
temperatures for a long period.
• The strength may deteriorate 
when resins are exposed to 
certain types of chemical or oils.
• The thermal expansion 
coefficient is high, and the 
dimensional change is larger 
compared with metal.

performance, shock resistance, and chemical 
resistance, but it is very expensive. It is mainly 
used for cages of high-speed bearings for 
machine tools.
<<Fabric reinforced phenolic resin>>
Phenolic resin is a thermosetting resin. It 
overcomes the disadvantages of hard and brittle 
phenolic resin having low shock resistance using 
fabric reinforcement. It is lightweight and has 
high lubricity and good mechanical properties. 
Injection molding cannot be performed because 
of the thermosetting property, so cages are 
made by machining. It is mainly used for cages 
of high-speed angular contact ball bearings for 
machine tools.
13.3  Rubber seal materials
Synthetic rubbers with high heat resistance and 
oil resistance are used as materials for seals. 
Different rubber is used depending on the 
degree of heat resistance.
Table 13.11 (A-144) shows the representative 
characteristics of the rubber materials.
<<Nitrile rubber (NBR)>>
Nitrile rubber has high oil resistance, heat 
resistance, and wear resistance, and is widely 
used as a general material for seals. The 
operating temperature range is -20 to 120°C.
<<Acrylic rubber (ACM)>>
Acrylic rubber has high heat resistance and can 
be used above the application temperature of 
NBR. It has excellent oil resistance but swells 
in ester oil. An ester oil resistant grade is also 
available. The operating temperature range is 
-15 to 150°C.
<<Fluorinated rubber (FKM)>>
Fluorinated rubber is a rubber material having 
excellent heat resistance, oil resistance, and 
chemical resistance. It is deteriorated by amine, 
so attention needs to be paid when combining 
fluorinated rubber with urea grease that 
precipitates amine at high temperatures. The 
operating temperature range is -30 to 230°C.
13.4  Periphery of bearing (shaft, housing)
Table 13.12 (A-145) and Table 13.13 (A-145) 
show physical and mechanical properties of 
representative materials used for shafts and 
housings. Heat treatment is applied to bearing 
materials that are used under large loads. Steel 
with enhanced bending strength and wear 
resistance (fretting strength) is used. For such 
applications, bearing materials (Table 13.6 and 
Table 13.7 on A-143) may also be used as shaft 
materials.
For housing materials that are used under 
large loads, heat treatment is applied, and 
materials with enhanced wear resistance 
(fretting strength) are used. For lightweight 
applications, aluminum alloy is widely used.
13.5  NTN bearings with prolonged life
NTN is promoting approaches and research and 
development from various perspectives with 
respect to long operating life of bearings. Two 
examples of approaches for bearing materials 
and heat treatment, (1) TAB/ETA/EA bearings 
and (2) FA tapered roller bearings will be 
introduced in the following sections.
13.5.1  TAB/ETA/EA bearing series
1) Characteristics
(1) Effective for lubrication conditions with 
foreign matter having high hardness
The main cause of the damage of transmission 
bearings of automobiles is foreign matter in the 
lubricating oil. TAB/ETA/EA bearings can be used 
to prolong the operating life of machines under 
such contaminated lubricating oil conditions.
(2) High peeling strength
Peeling damage is often caused by deterioration 
of lubrication conditions during use. The limit 
life can be prolonged by enhancing the bearingʼs 
peeling resistance.
2) Mechanism of prolonged bearing life
Bearing damage is often seen on the raceway 
surface. By applying heat treatment and 
selecting appropriate materials, the surface 
structure has enhanced toughness and 
improved resilience without impairing the 
surface hardness. In addition, for tapered roller 
bearings, crowning is also optimized. These 
suppress suppresses the occurrence of small 
cracks that might become the starting point of 
peeling and damage, prolonging the operating 
life.
(1) Crack resistance and stress releasing effect
The residual austenite, which is softer than 
the martensitic parent phase, has an effect of 
relieving stress concentrations acting on the 
periphery of the dent formed by foreign matter 
on the rolling contact surface under lubrication 
conditions with foreign matter mixed into the oil, 
thereby suppressing the occurrence of cracks.
As shown in Fig. 13.2, all the residual stress on 
the top surface of the dent part is shifted to the 
tensile side. The standard heat-treated product 
of through hardened steel has residual tensile 
stress. When a specially heat-treated product 
and a standard heat-treated product are 
compared, the special heat treated material has 
less shifting of stresses to the tensile side, which 
can be harmful, and a stress release action is 
observed.

appropriate amount of residual austenite and 
carbide dispersed on the surface region, and the 
structure is thermally stabilized by the special 
heat-treatment mentioned above.
The qualities of the material (residual stress, 
hardness, micro-structure) of a raceway surface 
generally change due to heat generation and 
shearing stress action during rolling contact, 
leading to fatigue cracks. Therefore, improving 
resistance to temper softening is effective to 
prevent surface-initiated damage. The residual 
austenite obtained by ordinary carburizing can 
suppress generation and progress of cracks 
and is work-hardened during use (the strength 
increases). Therefore, by using an appropriate 
amount of it, the material becomes tough. 
However, it is unstable against heat. On the 
other hand, when nitrogen is introduced and 
diffused under an appropriate condition, a 
matrix of residual austenite and matensite 
parent phase that is stable against heat is 
formed, and the material becomes resilient 
against quality changes.

13.5.2  FA tapered roller bearings
NTN developed special heat treatment (FA 
treatment) for refining crystal grains of bearing 
steel to half or less the size of the conventional 
ones by focusing on refining strengthening of 
crystal grains. (See Fig. 13.5) NTN adopted 
this technique for “FA tapered roller bearings,” 
thereby improving the indentation resistance 
and realizing long operating life under the 
lubrication conditions including foreign matter. 
Further, by combining optimization techniques 
for the internal bearing design acquired during 
development of the ECO-Top series, the seizure 
resistance is improved and the bearing size can 
be greatly reduced.
Remarks: FA is an abbreviation of fine austenite 
strengthening treatment.

grain refinement.
• The residual austenite amount is optimized 
by carbonitriding, and resistance to surface-

• Special crowning that is designed to obtain 
optimum surface pressure distribution under 
light to heavy load conditions is adopted.
Thus, the operating life under the lubrication 
condition including oil types and foreign 
matter close to the actual machine was greatly 
extended compared with the standard product.
2) Optimum oil film formation design
The rib area of a tapered roller bearing has 
sliding contact, and the quality of the oil film 
forming capability of this area greatly affects the 
bearing performance.
In the FA tapered roller bearing, the oil film 
forming capability of the rib area is improved by 
optimization techniques involving parameters 
such as the shape, accuracy, and roughness 
of the contact area of the flange and the roller 
acquired during ECO-Top bearing development. 
Thus, the rotational torque is reduced, and 
the seizure resistance and the preload loss 
resistance are improved.
3) Seating of assembly width
When a tapered roller bearing is to be used 
under preload, it is necessary to give sufficient 
stable rotation to the bearing and bring the 
bearing into a proper state in which the roller 
end surface and the inner ring rib surface are 
brought into contact with each other.
The smaller the number of stable rotations, 
the more reliably the preload setting can be 
achieved, and the assembly work becomes more 
efficient.
With FA tapered roller bearings, preload can 
reliably be set in a short time by the optimization 
of the internal bearing design. For example, it 
may become possible to stop applying gear oil 
to help achieve early stabilization. The roller 
becomes stable at a rotation speed equal to 
that of a conventional bearing by using only rust 
preventative oil.
4) Improvement in indentation resistance
To make bearings smaller, it is necessary to 
improve the indentation resistance to prevent 
safety factor decrease caused by a decrease of 
the static load rating.
Regarding FA tapered roller bearings, the 
indentation depth is less than one ten-thousandth 
of the rolling element diameter even under the 
static load with a safety factor (S0) = 0.6.

Fig. 13.16  Relationship between degree of

13.6  Bearing fatigue analysis technique
In a region subjected to plastic deformation 
due to rolling fatigue, various X-ray analysis 
parameters obtained by X-ray stress 
measurements (residual stress, diffraction 
half-value with, and residual ausentite) may be 
observed. There is a technique that estimates the 
degree of progress of rolling fatigue (degree of 
fatigue) based on the X-ray stress measurement 
result using this characteristic (Fig. 13.16). Since 
the mid-1980s, NTN has been investigating 
the relationship between the X-ray analysis 
value (fatigue degree in Fig. 13.16) and the life 
ratio (a value expressed by the percentage of 
the operating time in which peeling occurred 
is 100%) for surface-initiated damage (peeling 
and early peeling starting from dents), which 
has been frequently observed in the field. Since 
the relationship changes depending on various 
rolling conditions (combination of surface 
roughness, load, and lubrication condition), 
the values are used for reference; however, the 
remaining operating life can be estimated by 
using this relationship diagram.
Recently, fatigue degree estimation is being 
studied using variation in X-ray diffraction ring 
peak intensity with high sensitivity even in the 
latter stage of fatigue.

Comprehensive evaluation
The oil resistance, heat 
resistance, and wear resistance 
are high. It is widely used as 
rubber seals.
It is used at application 
temperature higher than that 
of NBR. It is easily swollen in 
ester oil. An ester-oil resistant 
grade is also available.
It is expensive. It has excellent 
heat resistance and chemical 
resistance but easily affected 
by urea grease.

Table 14.2  Fixing methods−bearings with tapered bores
Adapter sleeve mounting
Withdrawal sleeve mounting
Split ring mounting
When installing bearings on cylindrical shafts, adapter sleeves 
or withdrawal sleeves can be used to fix bearings in place 
axially. The adapter sleeve is fastened in place by frictional 
force between the shaft and inner diameter of the sleeve.
For installation of tapered bore bearings directly on 
tapered shafts, the bearing is held in place by a split ring 
inserted into a groove on the shaft, and is fixed in place 
with a split ring nut or screw.
Inner ring clamp
Outer ring clamp
Snap ring
The most common method of fixing bearings in place is to use 
clamping nuts or bolts to hold the shaft or housing abutment 
against the ring end face. The tightening nuts and bolts must 
be fixed so that they will not be loosened by axial loads or 
vibration when the bearing is being used.
Use of snap rings regulated under JIS B 2804, B 2805, 
and B 2806, makes for a very simple construction. 
However, interference with chamfers, bearing 
installation dimensions, and other related specifications 
must be considered carefully.
　Snap rings are not suitable for applications requiring 
high accuracy or where the snap ring receives large 
axial loads.
Table 14.1  General bearing fixing methods
14.1  Fixing of bearings
When a bearing that receives axial loads 
and preloads is to be attached to a shaft 
or a housing, an axial fixing method that is 
sufficient to withstand the axial loading such 
as a tightening nut, bolts, or snap rings should 
be selected because a serious problem may be 
caused when the raceway moves in the axial 
direction.
In addition, solid type needle roller bearings 
(with inner ring) and cylindrical roller bearings 
(NU and N types) that are to be mainly used 
as floating side bearings also need to be fixed 
in the axial direction because the raceway may 
move in the axial direction when the shaft is 
bent by a moment load, damaging the bearing.
Table 14.1 shows general bearing fixing 
methods, and Table 14.2 shows fixing methods 
for bearings with tapered bores. See section “15. 
Bearing handling” for more information about 
bearing installation and removal.
Depending upon the design of a shaft or 
housing, the shaft may be influenced by an 
unbalanced load or other factors which can then 
cause large fluctuations in bearing efficiency. 
For example, depending on the dimensional 
accuracy and shape accuracy of the shaft and 
housing, there could be insufficient interference 
fit with the bearing, leading to material creep 
during operation. When the machining accuracy 
of the shaft or the housing is insufficient or 
when there is an error in the installation, the 
inner ring or the outer ring of the bearing can 
become misaligned. Operation under this 
condition may cause excessive loading at the 
edges of the inner and outer rings as well as 
rolling elements, deteriorating the fatigue life. 
Furthermore, chipping damage may occur on 
the flange face of roller bearings due to heavy 
contact with the rolling element end surface 
while operating under misalignment. A speed 
deferential between the rolling elements and 
cage may apply abnormal force to the cage, 
causing damage. For this reason, it is necessary 
to pay attention to the following when designing 
shaft and housing:
(1) Bearing arrangement; most effective fixing 
method for bearing arrangement.
(2) Selection of shoulder height and fillet 
radius of housing and shaft.
(3) Shape precision and fitting dimensions; 
runout tolerance of shoulder area.
(4) Machining precision and mounting 
error of housing and shaft suitable for 
allowable alignment angle and permissible 
misalignment of bearing.
When the housing rigidity is insufficient, 
excessive deformation of the inner and outer 
rings may lead to poor distribution of loading 
among rolling elements, causing abnormal noise 
and deterioration of fatigue life. Therefore, the 
housing requires sufficient rigidity.
When two or more bearings are to be 
attached to a shaft, one typically serves as a 
fixed end bearing and the other serves as a 
floating end bearing to compensate for axial 
mounting error and allow for thermal expansion. 
In addition, when two or more bearings are to 
be attached to a housing, the design must allow 
through hole machining to improve the accuracy 
of the housing.

Note: For precision bearings (P4, P5 accuracy), it is necessary
to improve the circularity and cylindricity accuracies in this 
table to approximately 50% of these values. For more 
specific information, please consult the Precision rolling 
bearing catalog (CAT. No. 2260/E).
Table 14.5  Shaft and housing accuracy
14.2.3  Fitting dimensions for thrust bearings
For thrust bearings, it is necessary to make the 
raceway washer back face sufficiently wide in 
relation to load and rigidity. Consequently, fitting 
dimensions from the dimension tables should be 
adopted. (Figs. 14.2 and 14.3)
For this reason, shaft and abutment heights 
will be larger than for radial bearings. (Refer 
to dimension tables for all thrust bearing fitting 
dimensions.)
14.3  Shaft and housing accuracy
Table 14.5 shows the required accuracies for 
shaft and housing fitting surface dimensions 
and configurations, as well as fitting surface 
roughness and abutment squareness for normal 
operating conditions.
14.4  Bearing permitted inclination/
allowable alignment angle
A certain amount of misalignment of a bearing’s 
inner and outer rings occurs as a result of shaft 
flexure, shaft or housing finishing irregularities, 
and minor installation error. In situations where 
the degree of misalignment is liable to be 
relatively large, self-aligning ball bearings, 
spherical roller bearings, bearing units and 
other bearings with aligning characteristics are 
advisable. Although permitted inclination and 
allowable alignment angle will vary according 
to bearing type, load conditions, internal 
clearances, etc., Table 14.6 lists some general 
misalignment standards for normal applications. 
In order to avoid shorter bearing life and cage 
failure, it is necessary to maintain levels of 
misalignment below these standard levels.
See section 3.7 (A-29) for the relationship 
between “Inclination angle (installation error) 
and life.”

The shaft and housing abutment height (h) 
should be larger than the bearings’ maximum 
allowable chamfer dimensions (rs max), such 
that the abutment directly contacts the flat part 
of the bearing end face. The fillet radius (ra) 
must be smaller than the bearing’s minimum 
allowable chamfer dimension (rs min) so that it 
does not interfere with bearing seating.
Table 14.3 lists abutment height (h) and fillet 
radius (ra). For bearings to be subjected to very 
large axial loads, shaft abutments (h) should be 
higher than the values in the table.
14.2.2  For spacer and ground undercut
In cases where a fillet radius (ra max) larger 
than the bearing chamfer dimension is required 
to strengthen the shaft or to relieve stress 
concentration (Fig. 14.1a), or abutment height 
is too low to afford adequate contact surface 
with the bearing (Fig. 14.1b), the use of a spacer 
may be beneficial.
Relief dimensions for ground shaft and 
housing fitting surfaces are given in Table 14.4.

15.  Bearing handling
15.1  General information
Bearings are precision parts and in order to 
preserve their accuracy and reliability, care must 
be exercised in their handling. In particular, 
bearing cleanliness must be maintained, sharp 
impacts avoided, and rust prevented.
Bearings are vulnerable to impact. Do not hit 
them with a hammer directly or drop them on 
the floor. (Fig. 15.1)
In addition, bearings are sensitive to foreign 
particle contamination. When foreign particles 
enters the bearing during rotation, denting 
and/or scratches may occur, resulting in 
objectionable noise and vibration levels and 
rough bearing rotation (Fig. 15.2). Therefore, 
when handling bearings, it is necessary to keep 
the periphery clean.
For optimal bearing performance, proper 
bearing handling methods must be used. 
The handling methods described herein are 
general guidelines. Depending on the type 
and size of bearing needed, special handling 
“methods” may be necessary. For more detailed 
information, please consult NTN Engineering.
Using proper protective equipment and tools 
are also essential when installing or removing 
bearings, to avoid damage to the machinery 
and ensure the safety of the technician. Further 
information on proper installation and removal 
procedures is detailed in the following sections.
15.2  Bearing storage
Most rolling bearings are coated with a rust 
preventive oil before being packed and shipped. 
Please observe the following guidelines when 
storing bearings.
1. Ideally, bearings should be stored indoors at 
room temperature with a relative humidity 
of less than 60%. Avoid places in direct 
sunlight or in contact with outer walls 
because excessive temperature fluctuation 
or humidity rise may cause condensation.
2. Bearings should not be stored directly on 
the ground. Instead, they should be placed 
on a shelf or pallet at least 20 cm above the 
ground. The maximum number of shipping 
boxes to be stacked for storage should 
limited to four whenever possible (Fig. 
15.3).
3. Precision rolling bearings, large rolling 
bearings and thin ring or race rolling 
bearings must be laid down horizontally for 
storage (Fig. 15.4). Storing them standing 
vertically may cause raceway deformation. 
　To avoid damage during transportation 
such as fretting or false brinelling, ensure 
that the individual bearing boxes are 
packed laying down horizontally within 
the shipping box. Fill remaining space with 
dunnage(Fig. 15.5). 
　Some products have a ↑ symbol on the 
shipping box to prevent improper storage 
placement. Follow the indication on the box 
in this case (Fig. 15.6).

(1) Press-fitting bearing into shaft
Uniformly apply force by applying a sleeve to 
the inner ring width surface when press-fitting 
a bearing onto a shaft. Do not apply force to the 
outer ring as this will transfer the press force 
through the rolling elements which may cause 
dents or scratches on the raceway surface (Fig. 
15.11).
When press-fitting self-aligning bearings, 
using a ring-shaped block as shown in Fig. 15.13 
improves ease of installation.
(2) Press-fitting bearing into housing
Uniformly apply force by applying a sleeve to the 
outer ring width surface to press-fit a bearing 
into a housing. Do not apply force to the inner 
ring as this will transfer the press force through 
the rolling elements which may cause dents or 
scratches on the raceway surface (Fig. 15.12).

15.3.2.1  Press-fitting
Press-fitting is the most common mounting 
method and is widely used for small bearings 
small bearings. Bearings having a relatively 
small interference can be press-fitted by using 
a sleeve and applying force to the raceway at 
room temperature.
When press-fitting a bearing by applying 
impact with a hammer, use a resin or copper 
hammer rather than an iron one. To uniformly 
press the bearing onto the shaft or into the 
housing, use a sleeve. (Use of a mounting 
tool kit as shown in Fig. 15.40, A-168 is 
recommended.) Do not directly apply impact to 
bearing rings or press-fit them by using a punch 
because the bearings will not be press-fitted 
uniformly, causing bearing damage (Fig. 15.10).

Waste cloth
Sandpaper
Therefore, before mounting bearings, 
remove any burrs, raised material near 
dents, rust, or dirt on the shaft, housing, or 
accessories. (Fig. 15.9)
The shaft and housing fitting surfaces should 
also be checked for roughness, dimensional and 
design accuracy, and to ensure that they are 
within allowable tolerance limits. Further, when 
the bearing is to be press-fitted, using an anti-
fretting agent on the fitting surface improves the 
ease of assembly.
(2) Mounting jig
The jig to be used for mounting must have a size 
suitable for the bearing and be free of dirt or 
damage.
(3) Opening of bearing
Bearings should be unpackaged directly 
before use to avoid introducing foreign particle 
contaminates or condensation which would 
lead to rust. Gloves should also be worn when 
handling bearings to avoid rust generation.
(4) Removal of rust preventative oil
In general, bearings with grease lubrication 
may be installed without cleaning the rust 
preventative oil.
However, for bearings using oil lubricant, 
or when lubrication efficiency would be 
compromised by mixing the grease and rust 
preventive oil, the rust preventive oil should be 
removed by washing with a cleaning solvent 
and dried before installation. The shield type 
bearings and the seal type bearings filled with 
grease must not be cleaned.
When a large number of bearings are to 
be installed at one time, a dedicated jig or a 
hydraulic press may be used.

15.3  Bearing installation
A jig, a measuring instrument, a lubricant, and 
a clean and dry workshop will be needed for 
bearing installation. Further, if possible, it is 
desirable to install miniature/small ball bearings 
and precision rolling bearings in a clean room 
because intrusion of dirt and foreign matter 
significantly affects bearing performance.
Improper installation of bearings may 
cause marks from the rolling elements on 
the raceways, adversely affecting the bearing 
life. For the recommendations on machining 
accuracy and mounting accuracy of bearings, 
shafts, and housings, see section “14. Design of 
shafts and housings.”
15.3.1  Installation preparations
(1) Fitting surface of shafts and housings
When a bearing is installed on a shaft or in a 
housing with surfaces containing burrs or dents, 
the bearing may not seat properly, causing 
vibration and noise during operation (see Figs. 
15.7 and 15.8).

For heat fitting, any bearing that did not 
undergo dimension stabilization treatment must 
not be heated above 120°C to avoid permanent 
bearing damaged and shortened operating life. 
For sealed bearings, the seal temperature rating 
must not be exceeded.
In addition, heat torches and heat guns 
should not be used for heating bearings 
because the bearings may be heated non-
uniformly and temperature control is difficult 
(Fig. 15.15).

(3) Simultaneous press-fitting
When press-fitting a non-separable bearing 
such as a deep groove ball bearing onto the 
shaft and into the housing at the same time, 
use a ring-shaped block and uniformly apply 
force to inner and outer rings simultaneously. 
Do not apply force on either the inner or outer 
ring individually because it may cause dents or 
scratches on the raceway surface (Fig. 15.13).
[Caution]
• Excessive interference during installation 
may cause cracks and excessively small 
bearing internal clearance, resulting in 
seizure. For further detail, see section “7. 
Bearing fits.”
• Excessive impact at the time of installation 
may cause dents and damage.
• No foreign matter should enter the fitting 
surface during installation.
• For large interference fits and medium/large 
size bearings, consider other installation 
methods besides press-fitting at room 
temperature.
Fig. 15.13  Simultaneous press-fitting
The main methods used to heat bearings 
uniformly are (1) oil bath, (2) constant 
temperature oven, and (3) fast therm induction 
heater.
(1) Heating bearings in oil bath
One bearing heating method is immersing 
a bearing in a heated clean oil (Fig. 15.16). 
Foreign particles are often found on the 
bottom of the oil bath; therefore, do not 
directly place bearings on the bottom of the 
oil bath. Instead, place the bearings on a wire 
rack or suspend it in the oil and then heat it. 
Shielded bearings and sealed bearings filled 
with grease must not be heated in the oil bath 
(Fig. 15.17).
15.3.2.2  Heat fitting (shrink fitting)
When the inner ring interference is large or 
the bearing is large, press-fitting the inner ring 
onto the shaft at room temperature requires 
significant force. Heating the bearing and 
expanding the inner ring before installation 
makes the installation onto the shaft easier.
The inner ring expansion amount necessary 
for heat fitting can be obtained from the 
interference of the fitting surface between the 
inner ring and the shaft and the temperature 
difference before and after the bearing is heated 
(Fig. 15.14).
(2) Heating bearings in constant temperature 
oven
With a constant temperature oven, bearings can 
be heated in a dry state (Fig. 15.18).

(3) Heating bearings with fast therm induction 
heater
With a fast therm induction heater, bearings can 
be heated safely, cleanly, and quickly in a dry 
state. Heating bearings by induction heating 
makes the bearings magnetic; therefore, 
it is necessary to demagnetize bearings 
after heating. The NTN fast therm induction 
heater (Fig. 15.42, A-168) has an automatic 
demagnetization function.
[Caution]
• Use heat-resistant gloves for safety when 
handling a heated bearing. NTN heat-
resistant gloves optimal for bearing handling 
are available (Fig. 15.43, A-168).
• It is important to complete heat fitting 
quickly. If the bearing cannot be inserted 
onto the shaft during heat fitting, stop the 
process and consider removing the bearing.
• When heat fitting is performed, the inner 
ring contracts in the axial direction during 
cooling, creating a clearance between the 
bearing and the shaft shoulder (Fig. 15.19). 
Therefore, it is necessary to tighten the 
bearing with a nut until it is completely 
cooled or apply a force in the axial 
direction while the bearing cools, to bring 
the bearing into close contact with the 
shoulder of the shaft.
15.3.3  Installation of tapered bore bearing
Small tapered bore bearings are installed by 
inserting a bearing a predetermined amount 
with locknuts and by using a tapered bore or 
an adapter sleeve/withdrawal sleeve. Locknuts 
are tightened by a hook spanner wrench (Fig. 
15.20).

Clearance
Large size bearings require considerable fitting 
force and must be installed hydraulically.
In Fig. 15.21 the fitting surface friction and 
nut tightening torque needed to install bearings 
with tapered bores directly onto tapered shafts 
are decreased by injecting high pressure oil 
between the fitting surfaces.
Fig. 15.23 shows an installation method using 
a hydraulic withdrawal sleeve.
With tapered bore bearings, as the inner 
ring is driven axially onto the shaft, adapter or 
withdrawal sleeve, the interference increases 
so that the bearing radial internal clearance 
will decrease. Interference can be estimated 
by measuring the decrease in radial internal 
clearance. As shown in Fig. 15.24, the radial 
internal clearance between the rollers and 
outer ring of spherical roller bearings should be 
measured with a thickness gauge under no load 
while the rollers are held in the correct position. 
Measure the radial internal clearance on both 
rows, and check that the values are equivalent. 
Instead of using the decrease in amount of radial 
internal clearance to estimate the interference, 
it is possible to estimate the mounted radial 
internal clearance by measuring the distance the 
bearing has been driven onto the shaft.

Table 15.2  Tapered bore spherical roller bearings (installation of other series besides ULTAGE)
Table 15.1  Tapered bore spherical roller bearings (ULTAGE series installation)
For spherical roller bearings, Table 15.1 
(applied to ULTAGE series) and Table 15.2 
(applied to other bearings besides ULTAGE 
series) indicates the predetermined interference 
which will be achieved as a result of the radial 
internal clearance decrease, or the distance the 
bearing has been driven onto the shaft.
For conditions such as heavy loads, high 
speeds, or when there is a large temperature 
differential between inner and outer rings, etc. 
which require large interference fits, bearings 
with a minimum radial internal clearance of C3 
or greater should be used. Table 15.1 and  
Table 15.2 list the maximum values for 
radial internal clearance decrease and axial 
displacement. The remaining clearance in 
mounted bearings with tapered bores must be 
greater than the minimum allowable residual 
clearance listed in Table 15.1 or Table 15.2.
For self-aligning ball bearings, a 
predetermined interference can be obtained 
by tightening the nut until the radial internal 
clearance becomes about half the size before 
the fitting. After installation, check that the 
bearing lightly and smoothly rotates.

15.4  Lubricant enclosure
An appropriate amount of lubricant that is 
suitable for the use condition of the bearing 
should be applied if the bearings are not pre-
filled with grease. For details, see section “11. 
Lubrication.”
15.5  Post installation running test
To check that the bearing has been properly 
installed, a running test is performed after 
installation is completed. The shaft or housing 
is first rotated by hand and if no problems are 
observed at low speed, a no-load power test 
should then be performed. If no abnormalities 
are observed, the load and speed are gradually 
increased to operating conditions. During 
the test if any unusual noise, vibration, or 
temperature rise is observed, the test should 
be stopped and the equipment should be 
examined. If necessary, the bearing should be 
disassembled for inspection.
15.6  Bearing disassembly
Bearings are often removed as part of 
periodic inspection procedures or during the 
replacement of other parts. However, the shaft 
and housing are almost always reinstalled, 
and in more than a few cases the bearings 
themselves are reused. These bearings, shafts, 
housings, and other related parts must be 
designed to prevent damage during disassembly 
procedures, and the proper disassembly tools 
must be employed. When removing bearing 
rings with interference, pulling force should be 
applied to the press fit bearing ring only. Do 
not remove the raceway through the rolling 
elements.
[Caution]
Bearings and jigs used for disassembly may fall 
off when the bearing is removed from the shaft 
or the housing.

15.6.1  Disassembly of bearings with 
cylindrical bores
For small sized bearings, pullers shown in  
Fig. 15.28 (a) and (b) or the press method 
shown in Fig. 15.29 can be used for 
disassembly. When used properly, these 
methods can improve disassembly efficiency 
and prevent damage to bearings.
Fig. 15.29  Press disassembly
15.3.4  Installation of outer ring
With tight interference fits, the outer rings 
of small type bearings can be installed with 
a hydraulic press at room temperature. 
Alternately, the housing can be heated and 
expanded before installing the outer ring, or 
the outer ring can be cooled with a freezer, 
etc. before installing. If a freezer or another 
cooling agent is used, moisture will condense 
on bearing surfaces. Therefore appropriate rust 
preventative measures are necessary before 
cooling the bearing.
15.3.5  Internal clearance adjustment
As shown in Fig. 15.25, for angular contact 
ball bearings and tapered roller bearings the 
required amount of axial internal clearance can 
be set at the time of installation by tightening or 
loosening the adjustment nut.
To adjust the suitable axial internal clearance 
or amount of bearing preload, the internal 
clearance can be measured while tightening the 
adjusting nut as shown in Fig. 15.26. Another 
method is to check rotational torque by rotating 
the shaft or housing while adjusting the nut.
A shim with appropriate thickness may also 
be used for adjusting the bearing internal 
clearance. Fig. 15.27 shows the case in which 
angular contact ball bearings are used in a face-
to-face arrangment on the fixed side. A shim is 
inserted between the housing front cover and 
the housing shown by an arrow to change the 
fixed position of the outer ring.

Inner ring
To facilitate disassembly procedures, attention 
should be given to planning the designs of shafts 
and housings, such as providing extraction 
grooves on the shaft and housing for puller 
claws as shown in Figs. 15.30 and 15.31. 
Threaded bolt holes could also be provided in 
housings to facilitate the pressing out of outer 
rings as shown in Fig. 15.32.
Large bearings, installed with tight fits, 
that have been in service for a long period of 
time, will likely have developed fretting on 
fitting surfaces and will require considerable 
dismounting force. In such instances, 
dismounting friction can be reduced by injecting 
oil under high pressure between the shaft and 
inner ring surfaces as shown in Fig. 15.33.
Induction heating can be used for removing 
the inner ring of cylindrical roller bearings having 
no flange on the inner ring such as NU type 
and NJ type bearings. With this method, the 
inner ring is heated until it expands, and can be 
removed (Fig. 15.34).
The bearing becomes magnetized by 
induction heating; therefore, it is necessary to 
demagnetize the bearing after heating.
15.6.2  Disassembly of bearings with tapered 
bores
Small bearings installed using an adapter are 
removed by loosening the locknut, placing a 
block on the edge of the inner ring as shown 
in Fig. 15.35 (a) or the edge of the lock nut as 
shown in Fig. 15.35 (b), and tapping it with a 
hammer. In such a case, use a resin or copper 
hammer instead of an iron one. Bearings which 
have been installed with withdrawal sleeves can 
be disassembled by tightening down the lock 
nut as shown in Fig. 15.36.
For large type bearings on tapered shafts, 
adapters, or withdrawal sleeves, disassembly is 
greatly facilitated by hydraulic methods.  
Fig. 15.37 shows the case where the bearing is 
Fig. 15.38 shows two methods of 
disassembling bearings with adapters or 
withdrawal sleeves using a hydraulic nut.

oil is injected between fitting surfaces and a lock 
nut is then employed to remove the sleeve.

15.7  Bearing maintenance and inspection
Managing the condition of the machine during 
operation is important for preventing bearing 
failure. The following items are the general 
maintenance management methods.
(1) Inspection of machine while running
The interval for replenishing and replacing 
lubricant is determined by a study of 
lubricant properties and checking the bearing 
temperature, noise and vibration.
(2) Observation of bearing after use
Take note of any problem that may appear after 
the bearing is used or when performing routine 
inspections, and take measures for preventing 
reoccurrence of any damage discovered.
Maintenance management requires that the 
frequency for performing routine inspections be 
determined according to the importance of the 
device or machine.
15.7.1  Inspection of machine while running
15.7.1.1  Bearing temperature
In general, the bearing temperature increases 
after the start of operation and becomes 
steady at a slightly lower temperature after 
a certain time elapses (usually 10 to 40°C 
higher than the room temperature). The time 
until the temperature becomes steady differs 
depending on the bearing size, type, rotational 
speed, lubrication method, and heat dissipation 
condition of the bearing surroundings. It varies 
from 20 minutes to several hours.
When the bearing temperature does not 
become steady and rises excessively, the 
following may be the cause. Stop the operation 
and take measures.
<Main causes of abnormal temperature rise>
• Amount of lubricant too small or large
• Improper bearing installation
• Bearing internal clearance too small, or load 
too large
• Friction of sealing mechanism too large
• Unsuitable lubricant
• Creeping of fitting surface
The bearing temperature should not be too 
high to maintain suitable bearing operation and 
prevent the deterioration of lubricant. In general, 
it is best to use bearings at 100°C or below.
15.7.1.2  Bearing noise
To check bearing running noise, the sound 
can be checked and the type of noise can be 
ascertained with a listening instrument placed 
against the housing. A clear, smooth and 
continuous running sound is normal; however, 
determining the exact noise requires significant 
experience. Although it is difficult to express 
noise with words and it is different depending on 
the person, Table 15.3 shows the characteristics 
and cause of the typical abnormal noises of 
bearings.

15.7.1.3  Bearing vibration
Measuring the machine vibration during 
operation with a vibration measuring instrument 
can reveal bearing damage at an early stage. 
The bearing damage degree can be estimated 
by quantitatively measuring and analyzing the 
vibration amplitude and frequency. However, 
measurement values differ depending on 
the measurement positions and bearing 
use conditions. Therefore, it is desirable to 
accumulate measurement data and set criteria 
for each machine.
When the bearing is damaged, vibration 
including specific frequencies that depend on 
the bearing internal specifications and rotational 
speed occurs. The bearing vibration frequency 
can be calculated with the bearing technique 
calculation tool on the NTN website (https://
www.ntnglobal.com).
15.7.1.4  Leakage/abnormal deterioration of 
lubricant
The main causes of the leakage/abnormal 
deterioration of lubricant are as follows. It is 
necessary to take measures depending on the 
use conditions and environment.
• Too much lubricant
• Unsuitable lubricant
• Improper installation
• Unsuitable sealing mechanism
• Deterioration caused by use
• Unsuitable operating condition
• Abnormal deterioration
15.7.2  Observation of bearing after use
Carefully observe bearings after use and during 
periodic inspection, and take appropriate 
recurrence prevention measures if any damage 
was found. For details, see section “16. Bearing 
damage and corrective measures.”

15.8  Bearing maintenance tools
NTN offers maintenance tools for easily and 
safely installing/disassembling bearings. NTN 
also offers a portable abnormality detection 
device,” a small vibration measurement device 
that has excellent portability and usability for 
measuring the vibration generated from the 
machine.
15.8.1  Maintenance tools
Figs. 15.40 through 15.49 show some of the 
main maintenance tools that are convenient for 
installing/disassembling bearings. For details, 
see the special catalog “Maintenance tools 
(CAT. No. 6600/J).”
The FFT analysis clarifies the detailed 
operational state of the machine. By registering 
measurement conditions such as bearing part 
numbers and rotational speed, it is possible 
to detect the damage inside the bearing and 
estimate the damaged parts. In addition, 
selecting measurement conditions allows 
detecting abnormalities such as unbalance 
and misalignment of machines having rotating 
parts. In OA measurement, the acceleration, 
speed, and displacement can be displayed 
independently, and the measurement can be 
used as a general vibrometer.
The raw vibration data and the analysis results 
can be saved in smart devices for operation and 
can be downloaded in CSV format as necessary. 
In addition, the measurement device itself is 
dust-proof and drip-proof; therefore, the device 
is suitable for measuring vibration of machines 
used in various environments.

If handled correctly, bearings can generally be 
used for a long time before reaching their fatigue 
life. If damage occurs prematurely, the problem 
could stem from improper bearing selection, 
handling, or lubrication. If this occurs, take note 
of the application, operating conditions, and 
environment. By investigating several possible 
causes surmised from the type of damage and 
condition at the time the damage occurred, it 
is possible to prevent the same kind of damage 
from reoccurring. Table 16.1 gives the main 
causes of bearing damage and remedies for 
correcting the problem.

16.2  Rolling paths and how load is applied
When a bearing rotates in response to a load, 
the raceway surfaces of the inner and outer 
rings develop a hazy rolling path due to rolling 
contact with the rolling element. The rolling path 
on the raceway surface is normal. Evaluation of 
the rolling path of a used bearing can provide 
the engineer with useful information regarding 
the conditions the bearing had been exposed to.
Rolling path observation clarifies if a radial 
load was applied, an axial load was applied, 
or a moment load was applied. It can also 
shows if the bearing experienced a large 
load or a mounting error. These observations 
provide extremely important references when 
determining the cause of bearing damage.
Figure 16.1 shows rolling paths of point 
and linear contacts caused under various load 
conditions.
(1) is a general rolling path generated when a 
radial load is applied to a bearing with inner ring 
rotation. The width of the rolling path becomes 
small at the entrance of the load zone of the 
outer ring, which is the fixed side. On the other 
hand, (2) shows a rolling path pattern opposite 
to (1) when a radial load is applied during outer 
ring rotation. (3) is a rolling path generated 
when an axial load in one direction is applied 
to a bearing, and an example of linear contact 
on a spherical roller bearing. When a combined 
load is applied during inner ring rotation, a 
rolling path pattern such as (4) is caused. As 
shown in (5), when a radial load is applied to 
a bearing with significant misalignment due to 
a moment load, rolling paths are generated at 
two positions separated by 180 degrees in the 
load zone of the outer ring, which is the fixed 
side. (6) shows the case where the housing bore 
diameter is an ellipse. Rolling paths are left on 
the fixed side outer ring at two positions but are 
not misaligned. (5) and (6) indicate improper 
bearing use, and the bearing life may be shorter 
because of the adverse effect.

17.4  Fitting surface pressure
Table 17.4.1 lists equations for calculating the 
pressure and maximum stress between fitting 
surfaces.
Table 17.4.2 can be used to determine the 
approximate average groove diameter for 
bearing inner and outer rings.
The effective interference, in other words the 
actual interference Δ deff after fitting, is smaller 
than the apparent interference Δ d derived 
from the measured values for the bearing bore 
diameter and shaft. This difference is due to 
the roughness or variations of the finished 
surfaces to be fitted. Due to this, it is necessary 
to assume the following reductions in effective 
interference:
　For ground shafts: 1.0 to 2.5 μm
　For lathed shafts: 5.0 to 7.0 μm
Figure 17.4.1 and Figure 17.4.2 show the 
root approximate values of the fitting surface 
pressure and the maximum stress when the 
solid steel shaft and the inner ring of 0 class 
bearings (d/Di = 0.8) are fit.

17.5  Necessary press fit and pullout force
Equations (17.1) and (17.2) below can be used 
to calculate the necessary pullout force for press 
fits on inner rings and shafts or outer rings and 
housings. The force obtained by the equations 
only serves as an approximation, and a larger 
load may be required for the actual installation 
and removal.
For shaft and inner rings:
　Kd = μ・P・π・d・B  …………… (17.1)
For housing and outer rings:
　KD = μ・P・π・D・B …………… (17.2)
Where:
　Kd : Inner ring press fit or pullout force N
　KD : Outer ring press fit or pullout force N
　P :  Fitting surface pressure MPa  
(see Table 17.4.1)
　d :  Shaft diameter, inner ring bore 
diameter  mm
　D :  Housing inner diameter, outer ring

　B : Inner or outer ring width  mm
　μ :  Sliding friction coefficient

1.  Industry leading reliability
The bearing load carrying capability has been 
improved by optimizing the roller crowning to 
reduce edge stress and allow a more uniform 
pressure distribution across the contact surface 
(see Fig. 1).
(1) Rating life: 3 times longer (compared to 
conventional NTN products)
(2) Basic dynamic rating load: 30% larger 
(compared to conventional NTN products)
2.  Allowable misalignment
Allowable misalignment (single row): 1/600
Optimization of the roller crowning has allowed a 
combination of heavy loads (0.27 Cr) and allowable 
misalignment of 1/600.
＊Necessary minimum load: 0.04 C0r
Fig. 1 shows the contact surface pressure 
distribution of rollers considering an applied 
radial load of Fr ≦ 0.27 Cr. By optimizing the 
roller crowning, the edge stress is greatly 
reduced and the contact surface pressure is 
made uniform compared with conventional 
products.

Deep Groove Ball Bearings
Deep groove ball bearings are very widely used. 
A deep groove is formed on the inner and outer 
ring of the bearing enabling the bearing to 
sustain radial and axial loads in either direction 
as well as the complex loads which result 
from the combination of these forces. Deep 
groove ball bearings are suitable for high speed 
applications.
When two or more deep groove ball bearings 
are used in combination and mounted adjacent 
to each other a duplex set (D2) should be used. 
Duplex bearings (D2) utilize controlled tolerances 
to more evenly distribute the loading between 
the individual bearing rows which improves the 
overall performance of the assembly.
In addition to unsealed and unlubricated 
“open” bearings, NTN provides deep groove ball 
bearings that are pre-lubricated with grease and 
enclosed by seals or shields. See section “11. 
Lubrication” for a list of some of the greases 
which can be used.
Table 1 shows the construction and special 
characteristics of various sealed deep groove 
ball bearings.

As shown in Table 2, pressed steel cages are 
generally used for most deep groove ball 
bearings. Larger size deep groove ball bearings, 
and bearings operating at high rotational speeds 
often utilize a machined metallic cage. 
3.  Other deep groove ball bearing 
enhancements
3.1  Bearings with snap rings
A snap ring grove or snap ring groove with snap 
ring combination are optional enhancements 
for the outer diameter of most deep groove 
ball bearings. Snap rings allow for simpler axial 
positioning and installation in the housing. Snap 
rings can be utilized with both open type and 
sealed or shielded deep groove ball bearings. 
Consult NTN Engineering.
2.  Standard cage type
Table 3  Recommended fits for outer ring and

(3) Radial internal clearance
Radial internal clearance are the same as those 
for standard deep groove ball bearings. With 
standard fit and application conditions, a C3 
clearance is used. For more detailed information 
concerning this bearing and the availability of 
roller bearings contact NTN Engineering.
(4) Allowable temperature range
‒20 to 120°C
3.3  AC bearings (creep prevention 
bearings)
NTN Offers the AC type bearing which performs 
a similar function to the EC bearing. AC bearings 
have the same outer diameter dimensions as 
standard bearings with the addition of two 
O-rings located in circumferential grooves on 
the outside diameter of the outer ring. (Fig. 3) 
While the EC bearing is more beneficial 
when using a light alloy housing at elevated 
temperatures, AC bearings are suitable for 
applications where a “tight fit” is not possible 
but outer ring creeping exists under rotating 
load on the outer ring. AC bearing can also 
be installed as a floating side bearing to 
accommodate expansion of shaft by heat as it is 
more axial. Before installing the bearing into the 
housing, a high viscosity oil (base oil viscosity, 
100 mm2/s or more) or grease must be applied 
to the space between two O-rings. This lubricant 
forms a thin oil layer on the bearing outer ring 
which prevents contact between the outer 
ring and housing, lowers the friction, and can 
minimize the occurrence of creeping by utilizing 
the friction force of the O-rings.
3.2  Expansion compensating bearings 
(creep prevention bearings)
NTN offers the innovative Expansion 
Compensating (EC) feature to help with 
bearing retention when mounted in light alloy 
housings which is often a problem at elevated 
temperatures due to property differences 
between the bearing steel and the housing. 
This functionality is achieved by machining 
circumferential grooves into the outer diameter 
of an otherwise standard outer ring. These 
grooves are filled with an optimized polymer 
which has an expansion rate higher than that 
of the typical light alloy housing. The net result 
is a more consistent interference fit across a 
wide operating temperature range. This more 
consistent fit condition helps prevent the 
bearing from rotating within the housing (known 
as bearing creep) which helps ensure good 
performance and long life.
(1) Allowable load
As a result of having grooves machined in 
the outer diameter, the ring strength is lower 
compared with a standard bearing. Thus, in 
order to prevent outer ring fracture, it is 
necessary to limit the maximum load applied 
to the bearing to be equal to or less than the 
allowable load Cp (see dimension table).
(2) Fit with housing
Table 3 shows the recommended fits for 
bearings with light metal alloy housings. In cases 
where the bearing is going to be interference 
fit with the housing, it is very important not to 
damage the polymer material. Therefore, it is 
essential that the lip of the housing diameter be 
given a 10-15° chamfer as shown in Fig. 2. 
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, it is also 
advisable to apply the interference fit using a 
press in order not to force the bearing into the 
housing in a misaligned position.

●Miniature and Small Size Ball Bearings
B-45
The dimensional range of miniature and 
extra small bearings can be found in Table 1. 
Boundary dimensions for both metric and inch 
series are in accordance with the internationally 
specified ISO and ANSI/ABMA standards. The 
most widely used sealed and shielded type ball 
bearings generally have a 1 - 2 mm wider width 
dimension than open type bearings.
The main variations of these bearings are 
shown in Table 2. Miniature and extra small size 
ball bearings can also utilize snap rings, which 
simplify assembly within the housing. These 
bearings with snap rings can also be found in the 
dimensional tables in this catalog.
Among the most generally used sealed and 
shielded bearings are standard ZZ and ZZA 
type which incorporate non-contact steel shield 
plates. Fig. 1 also shows non-contact type 
rubber sealed LLB and resin sealed SSA type 
bearings, as well as the contact-type rubber 
sealed LLU bearing.

and small size bearings.
The accuracy of miniature and extra small ball 
bearings complies with JIS standards. Accuracy 
of these bearings is defined by Table A-54 in 
section “6. Bearing Accuracy.” Flange accuracies 
are listed in Table 3.
Radial internal clearance is defined by Table 
A-88 in section “8. Internal Clearance and 
Preload.”

Note: 1. Duplex angular contact ball bearings are manufactured in a set to specified clearance and preload values; therefore, they 
must be assembled side by side with identically numbered bearings and not be mixed with other arrangements.
2. To satisfy specified clearance and preload values, tightening must be performed until the inner ring width surfaces or outer ring width 
surfaces come in contact with each other.
Table 3  Duplex angular contact ball bearings — types and characteristics
1.  Design features and characteristics
Angular Contact Ball Bearings
1.1  Angular contact ball bearing
Angular contact ball bearings are non-separable 
bearings with a defined contact angle in the 
radial direction relative to the straight line that 
runs through the point where each ball makes 
contact with the inner and outer rings (see 
Fig. 1). Table 1 provides information on contact 
angles and their designated codes.
In addition to radial loads, angular contact 
ball bearings can accommodate single direction 
axial loads. Since an axial load is generated from 
a radial force, these bearings are generally used 
in pairs. Table 2 shows general angular contact 
ball bearing characteristics, Table 3 shows 
information on using duplex (side by side) 
angular contact ball bearings, and Table 4 shows 
information on multiple-row angular contact ball 
bearings.
For bearings with a contact angle of 15° and 
bearing tolerance JIS Class 5 or higher, see 
special catalog “Precision rolling bearings (CAT. 
No. 2260/E)”.

■Flush ground
“Flush ground” is the name given to the 
finishing method shown in Fig. 3 where 
the offset of the front and back faces of 
the bearing are ground to the same value. 
This allows a designated clearance or 
preload value to be achieved when using 
bearings with identical codes in DB or DF 
orientations. DT series bearings can also be 
used in various arrangements to achieve 
uniform load distribution.
General angular contact ball bearings are 
not flush ground. If it is necessary to flush 
grind any of these other bearings, please 
consult NTN Engineering.

1.2  Four-point angular contact ball 
bearings
Four-point angular contact ball bearings have 
a contact angle of 30° and a split inner ring. As 
shown in Fig. 2, when the inner and outer rings 
receive a radial load, the ball contacts the inner 
and outer rings at four points. This construction 
enables a single bearing to accommodate axial 
loads from either direction, and when under 
a simple axial load or heavy axial load, the 
bearing relies on two contact points like ordinary 
bearings.
1.3  Double row angular contact ball 
bearings
The structure of double row angular contact ball 
bearings is designed by arranging two single row 
angular contact bearings back-to-back in duplex 
(DB) to form a single bearing with a contact 
angle of 25°.
2.  Standard cage type
Table 5 lists the standard cage types for angular contact ball bearings.
These bearings are capable of accommodating 
radial loads, axial loads in either direction, and 
have a high capacity for moment loads.
As shown in Fig. 4, sealed and shielded type 
double row angular contact ball bearings are 
also available. Standard loads vary from those of 
open type bearings.

1) This value achieved with machined cages; when pressed cages are used, 80% of this value is acceptable.   2) Bearing numbers appended with the code 
“B” have a contact angle of 40˚; bearings without this code have a contact angle of 30˚.   3) Smallest allowable dimension for chamfer dimension r or r1.
Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer 
dimension r1 is identical to dimension r. Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is likewise identical to ra.

1) This value achieved with machined cages; when pressed cages are used, 80% of this value is acceptable.   2) Bearing numbers appended with the code 
“B” have a contact angle of 40˚; bearings without this code have a contact angle of 30˚.   3) Smallest allowable dimension for chamfer dimension r or r1.
Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer 
dimension r1 is identical to dimension r. Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is likewise identical to ra.

1) This value achieved with machined cages; when pressed cages are used, 80% of this value is acceptable.   2) Bearing numbers appended with the code 
“B” have a contact angle of 40˚; bearings without this code have a contact angle of 30˚.   3) Smallest allowable dimension for chamfer dimension r or r1.
Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer 
dimension r1 is identical to dimension r. Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is likewise identical to ra.

1) This value achieved with machined cages; when pressed cages are used, 80% of this value is acceptable.   2) Bearing numbers appended with the code 
“B” have a contact angle of 40˚; bearings without this code have a contact angle of 30˚.   3) Smallest allowable dimension for chamfer dimension r or r1.
Note: For bearing series 79 and 70, inner rings are constructed with groove abutments on both sides. Therefore, the inner ring chamfer 
dimension r1 is identical to dimension r. Furthermore, the radius r1a of the shaft corner roundness is likewise identical to ra.

Self-Aligning Ball Bearings
Table 1  Standard cage types of spherical ball bearings
Machined cage
2321S , 2322S
Cage type
Pressed steel cage
Bearing series
or model
12 and 13 series
22 and 23 series
The outer ring raceway of self-aligning ball 
bearings forms a spherical surface whose center 
is common to the bearing center. The inner ring 
of the bearing has two raceways.
The balls, cage, and inner ring of these 
bearings are capable of shifting in order 
to compensate for a certain degree of 
misalignment with the outer rings. As a 
result, the bearing is able to align itself and 
compensate for shaft / housing finishing 
unevenness, bearing fitting error, and other 
sources of misalignment as shown in Fig. 1.
Since axial load capacity is limited, self-
aligning ball bearing are not suitable for 
applications with heavy axial loads.
It is recommended to use an adapter on a 
self-aligning ball bearing with a tapered bore 
inner diameter for ease of installation and 
disassembly. These bearings and adapters are 
often used on drive shaft applications.
2.  Standard cage type
All bearing series are equipped with a pressed 
cage, except 2321S and 2322S, which are 
equipped with a machined cage.

5.  Precautions for using  
self-aligning ball bearings
Self-aligning ball bearings are unable to support 
large axial loads and therefore axial loading shall 
be limited.
Please consider using self-aligning roller 
bearings when a large axial load is to be applied.
Table 2
Bearings with part numbers listed in Table 2 
below have balls which protrude slightly from 
the bearing face as illustrated in Fig. 2. The total 
width dimensions are shown in Table 2.
The allowable misalignment angle can be 
determined by the following function. This 
degree of allowable misalignment may be 
limited by the design of mating components 
around the bearing.

Characteristics
¡NU type outer rings have two ribs. The outer ring, roller, and cage assembly 
can be separated from the inner ring. 
N type inner rings have two ribs. The inner ring, roller, and cage assembly can 
be separated from the outer ring.
¡Unable to accommodate any axial loading. 
¡This is widely used as the floating side bearing in a fixed-float arrangement.
¡NJ type has two ribs on the outer ring, a single rib on the inner ring; NF type 
has a single rib on the outer ring, and two ribs on the inner ring.
¡Can receive single direction axial loads. 
¡When there is no distinction between the fixed side and floating side bearing, 
these types can be used as a pair in close proximity.
¡NUP type has a collar ring attached to the ribless side of the inner ring; NH 
type is NJ type with an L type collar ring attached. All of these collar rings are 
separable, and therefore it is necessary to fix the inner ring axially. 
¡Can accommodate axial loads in either direction.
¡Widely used as the shaft’s fixed-side bearing.

Cylindrical Roller Bearings
1.  Types, design features, and characteristics
Cylindrical roller bearings can accommodate 
heavy radial loads due to the line contact formed 
between their rolling elements and raceways. 
These bearings are also suitable for high speed 
applications since the rollers are guided by 
either inner or outer ring ribs. Cylindrical roller 
bearings are separable, allowing them to be 
easily installed and disassembled even when 
interference fits are required.
Among the various types of cylindrical roller 
bearings, E type and EA type have a high load 
capacity while maintaining standard boundary 
dimensions. HT type has a large axial load 
capacity, and HL type provides extended fatigue 
life in poor lubrication conditions. Multiple row 
bearing arrangements are also available.
For extremely heavy load applications, the 
non-separable full complement SL type bearing 
offers special advantages. For SL type and four-
row cylindrical roller bearings, see section “C. 
Special application bearings.”
Table 1 shows the various types and 
characteristics of single row cylindrical roller 
bearings. Table 2 shows the characteristics of 
non-standard type cylindrical roller bearings.

¡Can accommodate larger axial loads than the standard type due to improved 
geometry of the rib roller end surface. 
¡Please consult NTN Engineering concerning necessary considerations, such as load, 
lubricant, and installation conditions.
¡NN type and NNU type are available. 
¡Widely used for applications requiring thin-walled bearings, such the main shafts of 
machine tools, rolling machine rollers, and in printing equipment. 
¡Internal radial clearance is adjusted for the spindle of machine tools by pressing the 
tapered bore of the inner ring on a tapered shaft. 
Remarks: For precision bearings for machine tools, see precision rolling bearings 
(CAT. No. 2260/E).

1) ULTAGE series cylindrical roller bearings has been developed for “longer life,” “improved loading capability,” and 
     “higher speed,” which are required for various types of industrial machinery. For details, see the special catalog (CAT. No. 3037/E).
¡Boundary dimensions are the same as the standard type, but the diameter, length 
and number of the rollers have been increased, resulting in higher load capacity.
¡Identified by the addition of “E” to the end of the basic roller number. 
¡Enables compact design due increased load rating. 
¡Rollers’ inscribed circle diameter differs from the standard type rollers and therefore 
cannot be interchanged. 
¡EA type bearings are ULTAGE series1).

Note: 1. Within the same bearing series, cage type is constant regardless of the cylindrical roller bearing type (NJ, NUP, N, NF).

2. For high speed and other special applications, machined cages can be manufactured when necessary. Consult NTN Engineering.

3. Among EA type bearings that use resin cages as standard, certain varieties use pressed cages. Consult NTN Engineering.

4. Although machined cages are the standard for two-row cylindrical roller bearings, resin cages may also be used in some of these 
bearings for machine tool applications.

2. Triplex arrangements of bearings are also available. 
Consult NTN Engineering for details.
Edge loading due to misalignment under general 
load conditions should be avoided to prevent 
premature bearing failure, The maximum 
allowable misalignment based on bearing series 
can be found below. The values apply when 
the bearings are to be used as the floating side 
of NU and N types. For NJ, NUP, and NH types 
that are to be used for the fixed side, consult 
NTN Engineering. Depending on the magnitude 
of the axial load, the edge loading may exceed 
recommended limits, which could lead to a 
reduction in bearing life.

5.  Tolerance of inscribed circle 
diameter and circumscribed

interchangeable cylindrical 
roller bearings
Table 4 shows the representative combinations 
of bearings.
As the rotational speed of the bearing increases, 
the temperature of the bearing also increases 
because of the friction heat produced inside the 
bearing. Operation at excessive temperatures 
will significantly deteriorate the lubricant 
performance, causing abnormal temperature 
rises and seizure. Factors affecting the allowable 
speed of bearings are as follows.
(1) Bearing type
(2) Bearing size
(3) Lubrication (grease lubrication, circulating 
lubrication, oil lubrication, etc.)
(4) Bearing internal clearance (bearing 
internal clearance during operation)
(5) Bearing load
(6) Shaft and housing accuracy
The allowable speed specified in the bearing 
dimension table is the reference speed limit 
which allows for satisfactory heat dissipation 
and lubrication conditions before adversely 
affecting the bearing. The allowable speed 
of ULTAGE series cylindrical roller bearings 
specified in the catalog is defined as follows.
[Oil lubrication]
The allowable speed for oil lubrication is the 
speed at which the outer ring temperature 
reaches 80°C with room temperature spindle 
oil (lubrication oil viscosity: VG32) supplied at 
1 liter/min under an operating load of 5% of the 
basic static load rating C0r.
[Grease lubrication]
The allowable speed for grease lubrication is 
the speed at which the outer ring temperature 
reaches 80°C with lithium-based grease 
(consistency: NLGI3) filled 20%-30% of the 
free space under an operating load of 5% of the 
basic static load rating C0r.
In either of the lubrication methods, the 
bearing temperature rise differs if the usage 
condition (operating load, rotational speed 
pattern, lubricating condition, etc.) is different; 
therefore, the bearings must be selected with 
sufficient allowable speed as specified in the 
catalog.
If 80% of the allowable speed specified in 
the dimension table is exceeded or the bearing 
is used under vibration or impact conditions, 
please consult NTN Engineering.
See section “9. Allowable speed” for the 
definition of the allowable speed of the 
cylindrical roller bearings that are not part of the 
ULTAGE series.

●Tapered Roller Bearings
B-127
Tapered roller bearings are designed so the 
tapered vertex of the raceway surfaces of the 
inner and outer rings and rollers converge at one 
point on the centerline of the bearing (see Fig. 1).
The tapered rollers are guided by the 
compound force of the inner and outer raceway 
surfaces which keep the rollers pressed up 
against the large rib on the inner ring.
A large variety of these bearings, including 
single, double, and four row arrangements, are 
available in both metric and inch series. Each 
Type
Characteristics
(1) There are both metric and inch series adhering to the standards shown in the following table.
Single row 
tapered
roller bearings
(2) In addition to the standard design, there are also medium contact angle and large contact angle types, 
denoted by the contact angle codes at the end of the part numbers (C and D, respectively). 
(3) Subunits 
Tapered roller bearings can be disassembled into parts: the inner ring, rollers, and cage (collectively known as 
the “CONE”) and the outer ring (known as the “CUP”). These are the bearing’s “subunits”. Subunit dimensions 
are standardized under ISO or ABMA standards, and unified subunits are interchangeable within each 
dimensional standard. However, high precision grade bearings are generally not interchangeable, and 
these subunits must be used by assembling only subunits with identical manufacturing numbers. 
Aside from any cautionary notes that may appear, the single row tapered roller bearings listed in the dimension 
tables have subunits standardized for both metric and inch systems (including J series). (Refer to Fig. 2)

Type
Characteristics
(4) These bearings are constructed to have a high capacity for 
radial loads, axial loads, and combined loads. The larger the 
contact angle, the greater the axial load capacity. When a pure 
radial load is applied to a tapered roller bearing, an induced 
load in the axial direction is also generated, so these bearings 
are generally used in pairs.
(5) Single row tapered roller bearings are separable, so both the 
inner and outer rings can be used with tight fits. 
(6) Tapered roller bearings are also manufactured with flanges 
attached to the outer rings. For more details, contact NTN 
Engineering. (Refer to Fig. 3)
Single row 
tapered
roller bearings
(1) When two single-row tapered roller bearings are to be used in 
combination, the bearing clearance and preload are adjusted 
by the inner ring spacer or the outer ring spacer (see Fig. 4).
(2) A product number and a combination code are indicated on 
inner rings, outer rings, and spacers. Parts displaying the same 
number and code must be used in combination.
(3) See A-96 Table 8.14 for the axial internal clearance.

and face-to-face arrangement (using double row inner rings) 
are both available. The assemblies have been adjusted so that 
each type's internal clearance values are fixed. Only parts with 
identical manufacturing numbers can be used and they must 
be assembled according to their code numbers. (Refer to Fig. 
5)
(2) See A-96 Table 8.14 for the axial internal clearance of 
double-row and duplex bearings.

2.  Standard cage type
In general, pressed cages (see Fig. 6) are used in 
tapered roller bearings. For large sized bearings, 
machined or pin type cages may also be used, 
while resin cages may also be used for smaller 
sized bearings.

3.  Allowable misalignment
Table 1  (continued)
Fig. 6  Pressed steel cage
In order to avoid edge loading and potential 
for premature failure, the maximum allowable 
misalignment based on bearing series can be 
found below.
The allowable misalignment of combined 
bearings is influenced by the load center 
position, so please consult NTN Engineering.
• Single row (standard) … ……………  1/ 2 000
• Single row (ULTAGE) … ……………  1/ 600
4.  Precautions
If bearing load is light during operation, or if the 
ratio of axial to radial load for duplex and double 
row bearings exceeds the value of e, slipping 
may develop between the rollers and raceway 
surface, sometimes resulting in smearing. The 
mass of rollers and cages particularly tends 
to be large for large tapered roller bearings. 
For additional details, please contact NTN 
Engineering.
In tapered roller bearings, the cage may 
protrude beyond the inner and/or outer ring side 
faces. Care should be taken when designing the 
housing and shaft to ensure contact with the 
cage does not occur.
The ULTAGE tapered roller bearings have been 
developed for “long operating life,” “improved 
load capacity,” and “higher speed” required for 
various types of industrial machinery.
For details, see the special catalog (CAT. No. 
3035/E).

●Tapered Roller Bearings
●Tapered Roller Bearings
Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of 
installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner and outer ring diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†”  
(inner ring) and “††” (outer ring), the precision class is an integer for class 4 and class 2 bearings only.

Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner and outer ring diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†” (inner ring) and “††” (outer ring), the precision 
class is an integer for class 4 and class 2 bearings only.
2) Bearing numbers marked “#” designate J-series bearings. The tolerance of these bearings is listed in Table 6.8 on page A-66 to A-67.
3) Chamfer dimensions of the bearings marked “＊” are shown in the above drawings.     4) Dimensions with “−” indicate a load center at the 
outside on the end of an inner ring.

Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner ring bore diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†” (inner ring), the precision class is an integer for class 4 
and class 2 bearings only. 
2) Bearing numbers marked “#” designate J-series bearings. The tolerance of these bearings is listed in Table 6.8 on page A-66 to A-67.
3) Dimensions with “−” indicate a load center at the outside on the end of an inner ring.

Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner ring bore diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†” (inner ring), the precision class is an integer for class 4 
and class 2 bearings only.
2) Bearing numbers marked “#” designate J-series bearings. The tolerance of these bearings is listed in Table 6.8 on page A-66 to A-67.
3) Dimensions with “−” indicate a load center at the outside on the end of an inner ring.

2) Bearing numbers marked “#” designate J-series bearings. The tolerance of these bearings is listed in Table 6.8 on page A-66 to A-67.
3) Dimensions with “−” indicate a load center at the outside on the end of an inner ring.
Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner and outer ring diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†” (inner ring) and “††” (outer ring), the precision 
class is an integer for class 4 and class 2 bearings only.

2) Bearing numbers marked “#” designate J-series bearings. The tolerance of these bearings is listed in Table 6.8 on page A-66 to A-67.
3) Dimensions with “−” indicate a load center at the outside on the end of an inner ring.
Note: Chamfer dimensions on the back face of the inner and outer rings of the bearing are larger than the maximum values of installation-related dimensions ras and r1as.
1) As for the maximum value for inner and outer ring diameters of bearings whose bearing numbers are marked with “†” (inner ring) and “††” (outer ring), the precision 
class is an integer for class 4 and class 2 bearings only.

●Spherical Roller Bearings

Allowable 
misalignment
Spherical Roller Bearings
Spherical roller bearings consist of an outer 
ring having a continuous spherical raceway and 
two rows of barrel-shaped rollers guided by an 
inner ring with two raceways. (Refer to Fig. 1) 
This bearing has self-aligning properties, and 
therefore is suited for use where misalignment 
between the inner and outer rings occurs from 
housing installation error or shaft bending. 
Spherical roller bearings have a large capacity 
for radial loads, axial loads in either direction, 
and combined loads. They are also suited for 
applications where vibration and shock loads are 
encountered. When spherical roller bearings are 
used with a vertical shaft or under a large axial 
load, the load on the rollers of the row that is 
not subject to the axial load becomes small, and 
the resulting skidding on the rollers may result 
in wear. If the ratio of the axial load to the radial 
load exceeds the factor e in the dimension table 
(Fa/Fr > e), consult NTN Engineering.
1.  Types, design features, and characteristics
In addition to spherical roller bearings with 
cylindrical bores, spherical roller bearings with 
tapered bores are also available. Bearings with 
tapered bores are specified by the suffix “K” 
at the end of the spherical roller bearing part 
number. The standard taper ratio is 1:12 for 
bearings with a “K” suffix; for bearings in series 
240 and 241, the suffix “K30” indicates the 
taper ratio for a bearing is 1:30. Most tapered 
bore bearings incorporate the use of adapters 
and withdrawal sleeves for shaft mounting.

Light loads: dynamic equivalent radial load ≦ 0.05 Cr

Normal loads: 0.05 Cr ＜ dynamic equivalent radial load ≦ 0.10 Cr

Heavy loads: 0.10 Cr ＜ dynamic equivalent radial load
2) When the shaft diameter exceeds φ200 mm and the bearing is to be used under heavy load or impact load conditions, please consult 
NTN Engineering.
3) The shaft shape error (roundness, cylindricity, etc.) must be within the tolerance range of IT5 and IT7.
Note: 1. All values and fits listed in the above tables are for solid steel shafts.
2. Use the formula below to calculate necessary interference. The upper limit value should not exceed 1/1 000 of the shaft 
diameter.

When Fr ≦ 0.3 C0r, necessary interference Δ dF (μm) is Δ dF = 0.08 (d・Fr/B) 1/2

When Fr ＞ 0.3 C0r, Δ dF = 0.02 (Fr/B)

(d: bearing bore diameter (mm), B: inner ring width (mm), Fr: radial load, (N), C0r: basic static rating load (N))

When the difference between the bearing temperature and the ambient temperature during bearing operation is to be 

considered, consider the effective interference Δ dT (μm) by the temperature difference as the necessary interference.

Δ dT = 0.0015・d・ΔT

(ΔT: Difference between bearing temperature and ambient temperature °C)

Table 3  Housing bore tolerance class in common use
As the rotational speed of the bearing increases, 
the temperature of the bearing also increases 
because of the friction heat produced inside 
the bearing. Excessive heat will significantly 
deteriorate the bearing performance, causing 
abnormal temperature rises and seizure.
Factors affecting the allowable speed of 
bearings are as follows.
(1) Bearing type
(2) Bearing size
(3) Lubrication (grease lubrication, circulating 
lubrication, oil lubrication, etc.)
(4) Bearing internal clearance (bearing 
internal clearance during operation)
(5) Bearing load
(6) Shaft and housing accuracy
The allowable speed specified in the bearing 
dimension table is the limit for heat dissipation 
and satisfactory lubrication conditions before 
the bearing is adversely affected.
The allowable speed of ULTAGE series 
spherical roller bearings specified in the catalog 
is defined as follows.
[Oil lubrication]
The allowable speed for oil lubrication is the 
speed at which the outer ring temperature 
reaches 80°C with room temperature spindle 
oil (lubrication oil viscosity: VG32) supplied at 
1 liter/min under an operating load of 5% of the 
basic static load rating C0r.
[Grease lubrication]
The allowable speed for grease lubrication is 
the speed at which the outer ring temperature 
reaches 80°C with lithium-based grease 
(consistency: NLGI3) filled 20%-30% of the 
free space under an operating load of 5% of the 
basic static load rating C0r.
In either of the lubrication methods, the 
bearing temperature rise differs if the usage 
condition (operating load, rotational speed 
pattern, lubricating condition, etc.) is different; 
therefore, the bearings must be selected with 
sufficient allowable speed as specified in the 
catalog.
If 80% of the allowable speed specified in the 
dimension table is exceeded or the bearing is 
used in vibration or impact conditions, please 
consult NTN Engineering.
See section “9. Allowable speed” for the 
allowable speed of the spherical roller bearings 
that are not part of the ULTAGE series.
3.  Allowable speed of ULTAGE series

5.  Allowable misalignment angle
Spherical roller bearings have the same self-
aligning properties as other self-aligning 
bearings. The allowable misalignment angle 
varies according to dimension series and load 
conditions, but the general allowable 
misalignment angles are listed below:
• Normal load or more:… …………… 1/115
• Light load:… ………………………… 1/30

＊Increasing the misalignment angle beyond the 
allowable angle may cause the rollers to 
protrude from the outer ring and interfere 
with nearby components.
6.  Adapters and withdrawal 
sleeves
Adapters are used for installation of bearings 
with tapered bores on cylindrical shafts. 
Withdrawal sleeves are also used to install and 
disassemble bearings with tapered bores onto 
and off of cylindrical shafts. In disassembling 
the bearing from the shaft, the nut is turned 
against the side face of the inner ring utilizing 
the bolt provided on the withdrawal sleeve, and 
then the sleeve is drawn away from the bearing’s 
bore. (Precision and dimensions of adapter and 
withdrawal sleeve are defined in JIS B 1552 and 
JIS B 1556).
For bearings with a bore diameter of 200 
mm or more, high pressure oil (hydraulic) type 
adapters and withdrawal sleeves can be made 
to make installation and disassembly easier. 
As shown in Fig. 3 construction is designed to 
reduce friction by injecting high pressure oil 
between the surfaces of the adapter sleeve 
and bearing inner bore by means of a pressure 
fitting.
If the oil supply inlet is attached in the nut 
side of the adapter, the supplementary suffix 
“HF” is added to the bearing number; if the oil 
supply inlet is attached on the opposite side, the 
suffix “HB” is added to the bearing number. For 
adapter sleeves, the supplementary suffix “H” is 
added to the bearing’s number for both cases. 
The hydraulic sleeve nut is equipped with holes 
for bolts used for mounting and dismounting 
and holes for hydraulic piping. The suffix SP 
(with screw holes) or SPB (with bolts) is added 
to the bearing number of the nut.
For information on the hydraulic adapters 
and withdrawal sleeves, see the special catalog 
(CAT. No. 4201/E).

●Thrust Bearings
B-253
Thrust bearings are designed primarily to 
support axial loads at contact angles between 
30° and 90°. Similar to radial bearings, thrust 
bearing designs may incorporate balls or rollers 
as rolling elements.
The configuration and characteristics of each 
type of bearing are given below.
With thrust bearings, it is necessary to supply 
an axial preload in order to prevent slipping 
between the bearing’s rolling elements and 
raceways.
For more detailed information, please refer to 
section “8.3 Bearing preload.”
1.  Single direction thrust ball 
bearings
As shown in Fig. 1, the steel balls of single 
direction thrust ball bearings are arranged 
between a pair of a pair of washers (shaft 
washer and housing washer), and the normal 
contact angle is 90°. Axial loads can be 
supported in only one direction, and radial loads 
cannot be accommodated. These bearings are 
not suitable for high speed operation.
Table 1 lists the standard cage types for single 
direction thrust ball bearings.

Note: Due to their material properties, resin cages can not be used in applications where temperatures exceed 120°C.

4.  Thrust tapered roller bearings
Although not listed in the dimension tables, 
tapered roller bearings like those in Fig. 4 are 
also manufactured. Contact NTN Engineering 
for more detailed information.
Fig. 4  Thrust tapered roller bearings
Thrust bearings incorporating cylindrical rollers 
are available in single row, double row, triple 
row, and four row varieties. (See Fig. 3) NTN 
Engineering offers the 811, 812 and 893 series 
that conform to dimension series 11, 12 and 
93 prescribed in JIS, as well as other special 
dimensions.
While thrust cylindrical roller bearings are 
only able to receive axial loads, the axial loads 
can be heavy due to the high axial rigidity of 
the bearing. For series 811, 812, and 893, the 
dimension tables are listed section “E. Needle 
roller bearings.” Bearings with dimensions 
not listed in the dimension tables are also 
manufactured. Contact NTN Engineering for 
more information.
Fig. 3  Double row thrust cylindrical roller 
bearings
Just like spherical roller bearings, the center of 
the spherical surface for thrust spherical roller 
bearings is the point where the raceway surface 
of the housing raceway washer meets the center 
axis of the bearing. Since thrust spherical roller 
bearings incorporate barrel-shaped rollers as 
rolling elements, they also have self-aligning 
properties. (See Fig. 2) Under normal load 
conditions, the allowable misalignment is 1/60 
to 1/30, although this will vary depending upon 
the bearing’s dimension series.
These bearings use machined copper 
alloy cages and a guide sleeve for the cage is 
attached to the inner ring. These bearings have a 
high axial load capacity, and can accommodate 
some radial load when the ring is axially loaded. 
It is necessary to operate these bearings where 
the load condition meets Fr / Fa ≦ 0.55.
The design for spherical thrust bearings 
is such that lubricant cannot enter the gap 
between the cage and the guide sleeve. 
Therefore, oil lubrication should be used, even 
in low speed operation.

1) Smallest allowable dimension for chamfer dimension r.   2) Maximum allowable dimension for shaft washer outer dimension d1.   3) Smallest allowable dimension for housing washer inner dimension D1.   4) Bearing numbers marked “＊” signify bearings 
where the bearing shaft washer outer diameter is smaller than the housing shaft washer outer diameter. Therefore when using these bearings, it is possible to use the housing bore as is, without providing a ground undercut on the outer diameter section of 
the bearing shaft washer as shown in the drawing.

The ULTAGE series sealed four-row tapered 
roller bearings [CROU…LL type] are designed 
to provide “high-load capacity,” “high static 
load capacity,” and “high sealing performance.” 
These traits are required for steel rolling mill roll 
neck applications neck applications to improve 
reliability with a longer operating life.
1.  Features
1) High-load capacity design
Higher load capacity and longer operating life 
are achieved by maximizing the size and number 
of rollers in the bearing.
Conventional
specification
ULTAGE
specification
2) World class static load capacity
Static load capacity is greatly improved due 
to optimized crowning of the rolling elements, 
reducing edge stress in the application under 
heavy loads.
3) Compact seal design with high sealing 
performance
The ULTAGE series four-row tapered roller 
bearing utilizes a specially designed fluorine 
rubber seal for high sealing performance, while 
minimizing the volume of the seal within the 
bearing.
Optimizing the tension force of the main 
seal lip and the overall design of the seal to 
minimize contamination ingress, reduces the 
internal water immersion by 50% or more while 
preventing grease from flowing out from the sub 
lip.
4) Standard adoption of long-life grease
This bearing is filled with an ample amount of 
long-life grease to avoid the need for cleaning or 
filling the bearing with grease before assembling 
into the application.

ULTAGE
Flow of grease
The ULTAGE series sealed spherical roller 
bearings [WA type] are designed to meet the 
demands of “long operating life,” “improved 
reliability,” and “improved easy handling,” which 
are required for various types of industrial 
machinery.
1.  Features
1) World class load capacity
Higher load capacity and longer operating life 
have been realized by adopting the internal 
specifications of the EA type, which includes 
maximum possible roller diameter size, 
maximum possible number of rollers, and a 
“basket-shaped” pressed steel cage.
2) Compact design with minimized seal 
volume
The standard seal design is a “contact type” dust 
resistant seal designed to minimize the volume 
of the seal within the bearing.
(1) Foreign matter intrusion is prevented by 
the adoption of the specially designed 
contact type rubber seal.
(2) Consistent dust resistance is achieved 
without changing the contact surface 
pressure of the seal with respect to the 
bearing alignment.

: dn≦ 6 × 104
When no grease is supplied	: dn≦ 8 × 104
＊dn value: 
[dn = bearing bore diameter d (mm) × 
rotational speed n (mm-1)]
4.  Allowable temperature range
Bearing temperature: ‒20～110°C
5.  Allowable misalignment angle
1/115 (mm/mm)
6.  Handling precautions
1) The radial internal clearance on an ULTAGE 
series sealed spherical roller bearing with 
tapered bore cannot be measured with 
a clearance (thickness) gauge. Please 
manage the clearance after assembly 
by measuring the movement in the axial 
direction shown in Table 15.1 (A-159) in 
section “15. Bearing handling.”
2) When the bearing misalignment exceeds 
the allowable misalignment (1/115), the 
rollers may come in contact with seal and 
cause seal deformation. It should be noted 
that the seal may come off when a large 
force is applied in this state.
3) Use Li-based mineral grease when 
re-greasing. Consult with NTN Engineering 
when using other types of grease.
4) When temperature mounting for assembly, 
the bearing temperature must be 100°C or 
below. The method of immersing bearings 
in hot oil cannot be used for this bearing 
type.
3) Standard adoption of long-life grease
This bearing is filled with an ample amount of 
long-life grease to avoid the need for cleaning or 
filling the bearing with grease before assembling 
into the application.
(1) Grease brand: Shell Alvania EP Grease 2 
(8A) with extreme-pressure additive for 
heavy loads
(2) Grease amount: Space volume ratio 15 to 
25%
4) Standard adoption of oil holes
The bearing is able to be re-greased due to the 
oil grooves and oil holes that are standard in the 
outer ring.

●                  Spherical Roller Bearings with High-strength Cage【EMA Type】
1.  Features
The ULTAGE series spherical roller bearings with 
high-strength cage [EMA type] use dedicated 
machined brass cages. These bearings are 
suitable for mining machinery (vibrating screens, 
crushers, etc.), which experience eccentric 
rotation and impact loads.
2.  Accuracy and clearance 
(specification for vibrating 
screens)
The inner and outer diameter tolerance 
and the radial internal clearance are set 
for vibrating screens to obtain the desired 
operating clearance. See the table below for the 
specifications of the ULTAGE series spherical 
roller bearings for the bearing specifications 
(accuracy, clearance, etc.) to be used with 
vibrating screens.

If this bearing type is used under a large axial 
load, the load on the rollers of the row that is not 
subject to the axial load can become small.  This 
small load on the rollers can result in skidding of 
the rollers, which can cause bearing damage. If 
the ratio of the radial load exceeds the factor e 
in the dimension table (Fa / Fr ＞ e), consult NTN 
Engineering.

The ULTAGE series deep groove ball bearings for 
high-speed servo motors [MA type] are next-
generation bearings with an optimized internal 
design for high-speed servo motors. These 
bearings have improved durability and longer 
grease life for high-speed operation and rapid 
acceleration/deceleration.

1.  Features
1) High speed and high reliability
Deformation from high-speed operation is 
reduced and limiting speeds of dmn = 1 million 
are achieved by using high performance cages. 
These cages are made of self-lubricating resin 
and have interlocking tabs for high rigidity  
(Fig. 1).
＊dmn value: 
dm (rolling element pitch diameter mm) × 
n (rotational speed min–1)
2)  Longer grease life
Outer ring grease pockets designed to maintain 
grease near the rolling elements improve 
lubrication reliability. In addition, long-life grease 
for motors “ME-1” (see Table 11.6 (A-116)) is 
applied for the initial grease fill.
(Longer life of five times or more is achieved 
compared with the lithium-based grease used 
for general purposes.)

3)  Low noise
A new resin interlocking cage design allows for 
low noise operation. The noise is reduced by 3 
dB-A with respect to metal pressed cages.

4.  Allowable speed
The allowable speed refers to a rotational speed 
of the bearing based on:
• Maximum outer ring temperature of 80°C
• Standard ME-1 grease filled to a fill volume of 
15-20% of the free space.
• Spring preload is applied to the bearing.
• Bearing operation at room temperature after 
break-in procedure.
The bearing temperature increase differs 
depending on the usage condition (operating 
load, environmental temperature, rotational 
speed pattern, etc.); therefore, the bearings 
must be selected with sufficient allowable speed 
as specified in the catalog.
If the bearing will continuously operate 
above 80% of the limiting speed listed in the 
bearing dimension tables, please consult NTN 
Engineering.

●Four-Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings
●Four-Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Design
Pin type cage
1.  Features
1) The bearings are mainly used in the roll 
necks of steel rolling mills and designed 
so that the load rating is maximized in the 
allowable space of the roll neck part.
2) The cage types include a comb type cage 
and a pin type cage (that uses hollow 
rollers). The pin type cage maximizes the 
number of rollers for high load capacity.
3) Carburizing steel is used in some cases to 
prevent inner ring cracks and to improve 
shock resistance.
4) Consult NTN Engineering for bearing 
internal clearance and fits to be used for 
back-up rolls of rolling mills.
5) There are many varieties of these bearings, 
including bearings which are sealed, have 
tapered bores, designed for high speed, 
have creep prevention, etc. Contact NTN 
Engineering for further details.
2.  Designs
Illustrations 1 to 7 show the several types of 
four-row cylindrical roller bearings that differ by 
the basic structure of inner rings, outer rings, 
and outer ring spacers.
The dimension table has the identification 
code (illustration + suffix code + oil groove code) 
specified in the illustration number column.

See the above illustrations 1 to 7.

　＊Illustrations 1 to 5 use solid rollers + comb type machined cage.

　＊Illustrations 6 to 7 use hollow rollers + pin type cage.

Suffix code

　M	: The oil hole of the outer ring is provided with a fitting nozzle for oil mist.

　R	 : The inner diameter surface of the inner ring has a helical groove.

　S	 : Special specification

Oil groove code

　①	: Oil groove on both side faces of inner ring

　②	: Oil groove on one width surface of inner ring

　③	: Oil groove on one width surface of outer ring

　④	: No oil hole or oil groove on outer ring spacer

●Four-Row Tapered Roller Bearings
●Four-Row Tapered Roller Bearings
Fig. 1
Fig. 2  Pin type cage
1.  Features
1) This type of bearing includes two double-
row inner rings with rollers, one double-
row outer ring, two single-row outer rings, 
and two outer ring spacers (Fig. 1 TYPE 
B). There is also a type with an inner ring 
spacer (Fig. 1 TYPE A). These bearings are 
manufactured so that the internal clearance 
values are fixed. Due to this, only parts 
with identical manufacturing numbers 
can be used, and they must be assembled 
according to their code numbers.
2) These bearings are mainly used in the roll 
necks of steel rolling mills and designed 
so that the load rating is maximized in the 
allowable space of the roll neck part.

(TYPE B)

3) Loose fitting is used to make the assembly 
and removal of the bearings easy. 
Carburizing steel is used to prevent inner 
ring cracks due to creeping and to improve 
shock resistance. There is also a bearing 
design with a helical groove in the inner ring 
bore to prevent wear.
4) The cage type includes a pressed steel cage 
and a pin type cage (that uses a hollow 
roller as shown in Fig. 2). The pin type cage 
maximizes the number of rollers in the 
bearing to provide increased load capacity.

●Ultra-Thin Section Type Ball Bearings
●Ultra-Thin Section Type Ball Bearings
C-58
C-59
A deep groove is 
present in both the 
inner and outer rings 
of the bearing, 
allowing them to 
support radial and 
axial loads in either 
direction as well as 
the complex loads 
which result from 
the combination of 
these forces. Deep 
groove ball bearings 
are used in the most 
applications.
When inner and outer 
rings are loaded in the 
radial direction, the 
ball comes into 
contact with the inner 
and outer rings at four 
points. The bearings 
are generally suitable 
for two contact points 
under a simple axial 
load or a complex 
load with a large axial 
load.
Angular contact ball bearings have a 
straight line that runs through the point 
where each ball contacts the inner and 
outer rings at two points at 30° with 
respect to the radial direction. The 
bearings can receive a unidirectional axial 
load or a complex load of radial load and 
axial load. The ability to include an 
increased number of balls increases the 
load capacity of the bearing.
　These bearings are normally used in 
pairs for applications where it is 
necessary to control the axial movement 
via axial internal clearance or preload.

There are three ultra-thin ball bearing types: 
radial, four-point contact, and angular. Bearing 
seals are available for all types.
Each bearing type has different characteristics 
to best support a wide range of applications.
1.  Types and features
Table 1 shows the types and features of ultra-
thin section type ball bearings, corresponding 
dimension series code, bearing cross section 
dimension, and inner diameter dimension range.
The dimension table (from C-62 to C-65) 
shows dimension series codes S and A, and H 
and J for bearings with seal.
2.  Part number
3.  Accuracy and radial internal 
clearance
Tables 2 and 3 show the accuracy and radial 
internal clearance of ultra-thin section type ball 
bearings.

¡The SL01 type is used for fixed side bearings and the SL02 is used for float side bearings.
¡The outer ring is divided in the circumferential direction by a special method and 
reconnected after rollers are embedded. The bearing side surface needs to be firmly 
fixed in the axial direction by the shoulders of shafts and housings.
¡The outer ring has oil grooves and oil holes.
¡The SL01 type can receive an axial load in both directions.
¡Dimensions Da and da are applied for the shoulder dimension of shafts and housings. 
However, when a moment load or a large axial load is to be used, dimensions J and K are 
recommended.
The dimension table (from C-68 to C-71) shows dimension series codes da, Da, J and K.
¡The SL04 type is only designed as the fixed side bearing.
¡The inner ring is divided in the circumferential direction by a special method and 
reconnected after rollers are embedded. The bearing side surface needs to be firmly 
fixed in the axial direction by the shoulders of shafts and housings.
¡The inner ring has oil grooves and oil holes.
¡A radial load and an axial load in both directions can be applied to the bearing.
¡The bearings are shielded, filled with grease, and have snap rings in the outer ring. These 
bearings are allow easy design into the application. The bearings are mainly used for 
sheaves.
¡Surface coating treatment is applied to prevent rust.
Note: For SL type cylindrical roller bearings, three-row, four-row, and five-row bearings are also available besides the double-row. 
Please contact NTN Engineering.

1.  Types, design features, and 
characteristics
SL type cylindrical roller bearings are double-
row full complement cylindrical roller bearings 
that have a thin cross-section and can withstand 
extremely large radial loads and impact loads. 
These bearings are suitable for a wide range 
of slow-moderate speed, heavily loaded 
2.  Dimensional and rotational 
accuracy
SL type cylindrical roller bearings are made 
according to JIS class 0 (refer to Table 6.4 (A-58 
to A-59) in section “6. Bearing tolerances”). The 
outer ring accuracy of the SL01 type and the 
SL02 type is before division. Regarding the SL04 
type, the inner ring accuracy is before surface 
treatment and division, and the outer ring 
accuracy is before surface treatment.
3.  Radial internal clearance
Table 2 shows the radial internal clearance 
Refer to Table 7.2 (A-80) in section “7. 
Bearing fits” for the inner ring rotational load.
applications such as construction machinery, 
vehicles, steel machinery, and lifting machinery.
These bearings can be produced both 
with and without seals. Table 1 shows the 
characteristics of this bearing type.
values. It should be noted that the values differ 
from standard cylindrical roller bearings.
4.  Selection of recommended fits 
and radial internal clearance
Table 3 shows the recommended fits when 
the bearings are used in outer ring rotating 
applications such as sheaves and wheels.  
Table 4 shows the relationship between the fits 
and the radial internal clearance.
It is necessary to equally apply load on 
the entire surface of the raceway end on the 
bearing side face at the time of assembly and 
removal.

●                  Precision Rolling Bearings for Machine Tools
●Bearings for Special Environments
For angular contact ball bearings for machine tools with a contact angle of 15° and bearing tolerance of 
JIS class 5 or higher, cylindrical roller bearings having bearing tolerance of JIS class 5 or higher, tapered 
roller bearings having bearing tolerance of JIS class 5 or higher, and bearings for supporting ball screws, 
see the special catalog “Precision rolling bearings (CAT. No. 2260/E)”.
Bearings for special environments are bearings that can be used for clean environments and high 
vacuum environments, where conventional bearings would not be acceptable. Bearings for special 
environments can also be used for the development of space equipment, vacuum equipment, and 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For details, see the special catalog “Ultra final series 
bearings for clean environment (CAT. No. 3028/E).”
●Rubber Molded Bearings
Rubber molded bearings are rubber rollers made by baking and bonding urethane rubber directly to 
the outer diameter of small deep groove ball bearings. Rubber molded bearings are suitable for low 
vibration and low noise applications, and feed mechanisms that require accuracy. For details, see the 
special catalog “Rubber molded bearings (CAT. No. 3021/J).”
●MEGAOHMTM Series Insulated Bearings
Bearings used for electric equipment such as motors and generators may cause electrolytic corrosion 
due to leakage current, which shortens the bearing life. MEGAOHMTM series insulated bearings are 
the bearings developed to prevent this electrolytic corrosion. The series includes ceramic and resin 
type bearings. For details, see the special catalog “MEGAOHMTM series insulated bearings (CAT. No. 
3030/E).”
●Clutches/Torque Limiters
1) One-way clutch
The driving force is transmitted only in one direction. In the opposite direction, the driving and idling 
can be switched by a clutch with a mechanism for idling. NTN provides a variety of one-way clutches to 
meet various needs.
For the clutch models, handling precautions, and other details, see the special catalog “Clutches 
(CAT. No. 2900/E).”
2) Torque limiter units
The NTN torque limiter unit (NTS type) is a unit composed of an inner ring, a coil spring, an external 
resin part, and a lid. When the torque acting between the inner ring and the external resin part is low, 
the inner ring and the outer resin part are rotated simultaneously. Under high torque conditions, the 
inner ring and the outer resin part are relatively rotated while keeping a constant torque.
For the torque limiter models, handling precautions, and other details, see the special catalog 
“Torque limiter units (CAT. No. 6404/J).”

●Needle Rollers
●Needle Rollers
Fig. 2
Fig. 3
High-carbon chromium bearing steel is used 
for needle rollers. The needle rollers ar ground 
and polished after heat treatment. The surface 
hardness is 60 to 65 HRC.
Needle rollers are provided as rolling elements 
or pins for operation directly on the shaft.
1.  Shape of needle rollers
The standard shape of needle rollers has a flat 
surface on its end face (referred to as F type). 
Crowned contact surfaces are also available 
(suffix code: E) and can reduce the edge load 
on the rollers. Excessive edge load on rollers 
can result in premature failure. Contact NTN 
Engineering for more information.
3.  Accuracy of needle rollers
The dimensional accuracy of needle rollers 
is maintained in accordance with JIS B 1506 
(Rolling bearings―Rollers). (Refer to Table 2)
Needle rollers are separated into groupings 
of 2μm ranges based on the diameter of 
the roller and are separately packaged to 
maintain consistency between supplied rollers. 
Depending on the tolerance range, the needle 
rollers are classified by label colors such as red, 
black, and blue, and then delivered.
Bearing rollers in packages having different 
label colors must not be mixed.
2.  Needle roller part number 
composition
The needle roller part number is composed of a 
model code (end face type), a dimension code 
[diameter (Dw) x length (Lw)], and a suffix code 
(Refer to Fig. 1).
1) For HL, contact NTN Engineering.
4.  Application of needle rollers
When a full compliment needle roller bearing 
is made with a standard needle roller, the shaft 
diameter (d), the housing bore diameter (D), the 
circumferential clearance (ΔC), and the radial 
internal clearance (Δr) are calculated from the 
needle roller diameter (Dw) and the number of 
rollers (Z) (see Fig. 2).
The minimum value of the circumferential 
clearance (ΔC) is calculated by Equation (1). The 
radial internal clearance (Δr) is selected based 
on the shaft diameter and the usage conditions 
using section “E. Needle roller bearings 2.4 Solid 
type needle roller bearings Table 9 (E-7)” as 
guidance. Full complement needle roller 
bearings generally require a larger radial inner 
clearance than a needle roller bearing with cage.
The minimum value of the housing bore 
diameter (D) and the maximum value of the 
shaft diameter (d) are calculated from Equations 
(2) and (3).
In order to retain the needle rollers in the 
housing using the keystone method, the 
maximum value of the housing bore diameter 
(D) is calculated from the minimum value of the 
roller diameter (Dw min) and the number of 
rollers (Z) using Equation (4) (see Fig. 3). Factor 
K is shown in Table 4.
ΔC = (0.005 ～0.020) × Z   mm

Needle roller bearing are rolling bearings which 
have small diameter cylindrical rolling elements 
whose length is relatively long compared with 
their diameter.
Needle roller bearings have a small cross-
sectional height and have a larger load capacity 
and rigidity than other types of rolling bearings 
for their relative size. They are also suitable for 
oscillating motion due to their low moment 
of inertia. Types of needle roller bearings are 
shown in the table below. This catalog provides 
dimension tables for the representative bearing 
types indicated by blue text in the table below.
For more information about needle roller 
bearings, see the special catalog issued separately 
“Needle roller bearings (CAT. No. 2300/E).”

2.1  Required accuracy and surface 
hardness of raceway surfaces
For applications using needle roller bearings, 
the outer diameter of the shaft or the inner 
diameter of the housing or the gear is 
sometimes used directly as a raceway surface. 
Table 1 shows the accuracy, surface roughness, 
and surface hardness required for raceway 
surfaces in order to keep radial clearance 
within the prescribed allowable tolerance range 
after needle roller bearing installation, and 
to ensuring high rotational accuracy. To set a 
surface hardness of the raceway surface from 58 
to 64 HRC and obtain a sufficient load capacity, 
apply appropriate heat treatment to materials 
as shown in Table 2.
Depending on the usage conditions, the 
bearing function may not be satisfactory even 
with the following recommended values. If this 
applies, consult with NTN Engineering.
When steel is surface-hardened by carburizing 
or carbonitriding, the depth from the surface to 
550 HV is defined as effective case depth per 
JIS. The minimum value of the effective case 
depth is roughly estimated using formula (1).
　Eht min ≧　0.8Dw（0.1 ＋ 0.002Dw）………（1）
Where:
　Eht min	: Minimum effective case depth, mm
　Dw	
: Roller diameter, mm
Needle roller bearings have low allowable 
misalignment because the ratio of roller 
length to roller diameter is high. For normal 
applications, bearing misalignment must not 
exceed the values shown in Table 3. 
Mating part dimensions must be set so that 
the rolling surface does not come in contact 
with the recessed portion of the shaft or the 
chamfered area of the housing raceway surface. 
Contact NTN Engineering when dimension Amin 
(Fig. 1) must be confirmed.

2.2  Needle roller bearing with cage
These needle roller bearings include needle 
rollers and cages that guide and hold the needle 
rollers. The structure is lightweight and compact 
because no inner ring or outer ring is used and 
the shaft and the housing are used as raceway 
surfaces.
Table 4 shows recommended fits for this 
bearing type, and Table 5 shows the diameter 
dimensional tolerance and classification of 
needle rollers. See section 2.1 for the accuracy 
and surface hardness necessary for shafts and 
housings serving as the raceway surfaces for 
these bearings.
The needle roller diameter variation included 
in a single assembly is within 2 μm, and the 
standard classification shown in Table 5 will be 
supplied if there is no particular designation. 
When two or more of the same bearings are to 
be used in tandem arrangement, it is necessary 
to use bearings having rollers of the same 
classification promote equal load sharing.
For caged needle roller bearings that are 
used for the connecting rod of small/medium 
reciprocating engines, see the catalog “Needle 
roller bearings (CAT. No. 2300/E).”
Cage
Snap ring
Thrust ring
When a caged needle roller bearing is used as 
a single body to be directly guided in the axial 
direction by a shaft shoulder (Fig. 2), any part 
coming into contact with the cage side surface 
must be sufficiently finished without burrs. For 
high speed or heavy load operation, the contact 
surface is hardened and finished by grinding.
When a cage is to be guided in the axial 
direction with a snap ring (Fig. 2), a thrust ring is 
used between the cage and the snap ring so that 
the snap ring lugs do not come in contact with 
the cage directly.
2.3  Drawn cup needle roller bearings
The outer ring of drawn cup needle roller 
bearings is formed by precision drawing from 
a thin steel plate, and is designed to have an 
appropriate accuracy for its intended function 
when press-fit into a rigid housing.
Therefore, it is meaningless to measure the 
dimensional accuracy of the bearing itself 
before press fitting.  After pressing into a ring 
gage (with wall thickness of 20 mm or more) 
having appropriate dimensions, the bearing 
accuracy is evaluated by measuring the roller 
inscribed circle diameter (Fw) with a plug 
gauge or a tapered gauge.
Recommended fits for drawn cup needle 
roller bearings are shown in Table 6, and 
recommended shaft and housing accuracy is 
shown in Table 7. Tables 8.1 and 8.2 show the 
dimensional tolerances of the ring gauge inner 
diameter dimension and the roller inscribed 
circle diameter (Fw) with respect to the standard 
metric series HK and BK types and the heavy 
load series HMK type.

When a plug gauge is used for the 
measurement of the roller inscribed circle 
diameter (Fw), the dimension of the go side 
is the lower limit of the dimensional tolerance 
of the roller inscribed circle diameter, and 
the dimension of the no-go side is the value 
obtained by adding 2 μm to the upper limit of 
the dimensional tolerance of the roller inscribed 
circle diameter.
Since the outer ring is formed by a thin 
steel plate, the safety factor (S0) when the 
bearing is used must be S0 ≧ 3 for standard 
specifications, and S0 ≧ 2 must be maintained 
for the carburized/quenched specification 
(premium shell bearing1)).

“Premium shell bearings (CAT. No. 3029/JE).” (Suffix 
code F is added to the bearing number.)

installation jig like that shown in Fig. 3, having 
a mandrel equipped with an O-ring for ease 
of installation, should be used to ensure the 
bearing will not fall off or become damaged

Table 8.2  Accuracy of drawn cup needle roller 
bearings (2)
Since a drawn cup needle roller bearing 
is positioned by means of the housing, it 
is unnecessary to provide a snap ring or a 
shoulder. However, when a drawn cup needle 
roller bearing is to be press-fitted into a 
housing having a shoulder, it is necessary to pay 
attention to prevent the bearing side surface 
from contacting the shoulder, thereby causing 
deformation of the bearing.
1) Pre-bent specification
The outer ring flange is hardened on both sides by heat 
treating the outer ring after inserting the cage and rollers 
and bending the edge of the ring.
Thus, bearings can be press-fitted from any direction 
compared with conventional products, which required 
applying a jig on the outer ring marking side. (Suffix code 
M is added to the bearing number.)
2.4  Solid type needle roller bearings
These bearings have a non-separable 
construction held together by flanges or side 
plates on both sides of the outer ring, with 
needle rollers and cages contained within a 
solid (machined) outer ring. Since the outer ring 
is solid (machined), it has high rigidity and the 
bearing accuracy can be increased; therefore, 
the bearings are suitable for applications 
that require high speed, high load, and high 
rotational accuracy.
There are two types of solid type needle 
roller bearings: one having an inner ring and 
one having no inner ring. Bearings without an 
inner ring use the shaft directly as a raceway 
surface, and the required dimensional tolerance 
of the shaft diameter (raceway diameter) is as 
shown in Table 9 based on required operating 
clearance (see Table 1 required accuracy 
of other parameters). The corresponding 
dimensional tolerance of the housing bore is set 
to K7, which is widely used in general. Please 
consult NTN Engineering when setting the 
dimensional tolerance of the housing bore to 
other classes.
Tables 10.1 and 10.2 show values of the 
radial internal clearance of bearings with an 
inner ring. Table 10.1 shows the clearance of 
interchangeable bearings, and the clearance 
values are satisfied even if the inner rings and 
outer rings are intermixed. Table 10.2 shows 
the clearance of non-interchangeable bearings, 
and the clearance range is tightly controlled. 
Therefore, the inner rings and outer rings 
cannot be intermixed. The clearance codes 
are C2, normal, C3, and C4 from smallest to 
largest, and suffix code NA is added for the non-
interchangeable clearance.

When there is an oil hole on the raceway 
surface, bearings should be installed such 
that the oil hole position is located in the non-
loaded region. A bearing with an inner ring 
must be used within the allowable movement 
amount (s) (a state in which the rollers are 
within the range of the inner ring effective 
contact length). The allowable movement 
amount (s) is illustrated in Fig. 4, values are 
listed in the bearing dimension tables.

2.5  Thrust roller bearing
Thrust roller bearings are bearings having a 
disc-shaped raceway combined with a cage-
and-roller assembly having needle rollers 
or cylindrical rollers radially embedded, and 
are suitable for axial loads applied in a single 
direction.
Further, a shaft or housing can be directly used 
as a raceway surface without using a separate 
raceway ring. Thereby, size in the axial direction 
can be minimized, and lightweight and compact 
designs can be obtained. Table 11 shows fits 
recommended for thrust roller bearings. See 
Table 1 for the required accuracy of the raceway 
surface.
2.6  Cam follower/roller follower
A cam follower is a track roller having a stud in 
place of an inner ring, and the outer ring rolls on 
a track. It is a bearing used as an eccentric roller, 
a guide roller, etc., and it can have a cylindrical 
shape or a spherical shape for the outer ring 
outer diameter. Cam follower bearings are 
offered in both cage type and full complement 
designs.
When attaching a cam follower do not strike 
the flange part with a hammer because sharp 
impact may cause cracks and rotational 
failure (Fig. 5). In addition, the oil supply hole 
position on the stud raceway surface of the cam 
follower is indicated by the NTN mark on the 
stud flange surface. Install it by rotating the nut 
while the fixing the stud so that the mark (oil 
hole) is positioned in the non-loaded region 
(Fig. 6). The thread part may break if too much 
tightening torque is applied.

A roller follower is a bearing in which the outer 
ring rolls on a track. As with the cam follower, 
there is a cylindrical shape or a spherical shape 
for the outer ring outer diameter, and are offered 
in both cage type and full complement designs. 
Common uses include use as an eccentric 
roller, guide roller, rocker arm roller, cam roller, 
pressure roller, etc.
A roller follower must be installed so that the 
oil hole is positioned in the non-loaded region 
because installing the oil hole position of the 
inner ring in the loaded region may shorten the 
bearing life.
Table 12 shows the radial internal clearance of 
cam followers and roller followers, Tables 13  
and 14 show the dimensional accuracy and 
recommended fits of cam followers, and Table 
15 shows the recommended fits of roller 
followers.

The maximum radial load that can be statically 
permitted on the contact surface between 
the track and the track roller is referred to as 
the track load capacity, and the value differs 
depending on the hardness of the track. The 
track load capacity specified in the dimension 
table is a value considering a track hardness 
of 40 HRC, and the load capacity of tracks 
having different hardness may be obtained 
by multiplying the track load capacity in the 
dimension table by the correction coefficient G 
in Table 16. However, when the calculated track 
load capacity exceeds the basic static rating 
load C0r of the bearing, the track load capacity 
is equal to the basic static rating load C0r of the 
bearing.

Since NTN cam followers and roller followers 
are generally installed with cantilever loading, a 
non-uniform load (one-sided load) may act on 
the bearing due to the influence of loosening 
of the fitting caused by continuous use. For 
stable operation of equipment, it is necessary to 
pay sufficient attention to the looseness of the 
fitting.
Further, lubrication is also necessary between 
the outer ring outer diameter surface and the 
track of the bearing. Even after lubrication, 
the bearing and the track may be damaged at 
an early stage when slippage occurs between 
the outer ring outer diameter surface and the 
track of the bearing due to rapid radial load 
fluctuation or rotational speed fluctuation during 
use.
For details, see the special catalog “Needle 
roller bearings (CAT. No. 2300/E)” or “Cam 
follower & roller follower (CAT. No. 3604/JE).”

The NTN bearing unit is a combination of a 
radial ball bearing with seals and a cast iron or 
steel housing of various shapes. The bearing 
outer diameter surface and the housing inner 
diameter surface are spherical and have a self-
aligning design.
The internal construction of the ball bearing 
for units uses the same steel ball and cage as 
the bearing series 62 and 63 of the NTN deep 
groove ball bearings. Seals consisting of an oil 
resistant synthetic rubber, and a NTN unique 
slinger (also referred to as a flinger) is provided 
on both sides.
The included bearings for units are factory 
filled with grease and sealed, but can be

“11. Lubrication” for greases used.
1.  Design features and characteristics of bearing unit
The ball bearings for units have a wide inner ring 
which depending on the type, fit to the shaft in 
the following ways:
1. The inner ring is fastened to the shaft in two 
places by ball point setscrews.
2. The inner ring has a tapered bore and is 
fitted to the shaft by means of an adapter.
3. The inner ring is fastened to the shaft by an 
eccentric locking collar system by means 
of eccentric groves on the side of the inner 
ring and a collar.
4. The inner ring is fastened to the shaft by 
providing an interference fit.
For the details of NTN bearing units, see 
the special catalog “Bearing units (CAT. No. 
2400/E).”

3.2  Accuracy of housings for units
Table 5 shows the spherical bearing seating 
(spherical surface inner diameter) of housings 
for units. For other dimensional accuracy, see 
the special catalog “Bearing units (CAT. No. 
2400/E).”
The accuracy of NTN bearing units conform to 
JIS B1558 (Roller bearings: insert bearings and 
eccentric locking rings) and JIS B1559 (Roller 
bearings: insert bearings and steel housings).
3.1  Accuracy of ball bearings for units
Tables 3 and 4 show the accuracy of ball 
bearings for units.
3.3  Bearing internal clearance
The standard internal clearance of ball bearings 
used in bearing units is CN (see Technical 
Explanation 8 Table 8.8). However, for the values 
of CN clearance of tapered bore type bearings, 
the values of C3 clearance of deep groove ball 
bearings is applied.

Bearing bore diameter code
The allowable speed of bearings for units that 
allows safe long operation is restricted by the 
bearing dimensions, loads, and circumferential 
speed of the seal contact lip. Fig. 1 shows the 
allowable speed that considers these factors. 
When higher speed is necessary, use a bearing 
unit that uses a non-contact type shield. Consult 
with NTN Engineering for additional details.

5.  Lubrication
NTN bearing units are factory filled with an 
appropriate amount of grease.
The grease amount necessary for lubrication 
is very small in general, and the grease amount 
of NTN bearing units is about 1/2 to 1/3 of the 
bearing internal free space.
The grease must be filled until a small 
amount of grease is discharged to the entire 
circumference between the bearing outer ring 
inner diameter and the slinger outer diameter.
Rough standard of the amount of pressure 
required to insert grease: 1 to 3 MPa
6.  Housing strength
The static breaking strength of housings for 
units differs depending on the housing type 
and load characteristics. The pillow block type 
unit is originally designed based on the use of 
a downward load. For other types of loading, 
please consult NTN Engineering.
Table 6 and Figs. 2 and 3 show approximate 
values of average static breaking loads by the 
load direction of pillow unit housings. Consult 
NTN Engineering for the strength of other types 
of housings.
The allowable load of unit housings can be 
obtained from the static breaking load and 
the safety factor S0 shown in Table 7 from the 
formula below.
P0 =  Pst
          S0

7.  Alignment allowance
The alignment allowance between the housing 
attachment surface and the shaft must be within 
1/30 (1/60 for the narrow width outer ring type) 
due to grease channel alignment considerations. 
The alignment allowance of units with a cover 
differs depending on the cover seal, so please 
consult NTN Engineering.
8.  Recommended bearing fits
Shafts used for NTN bearing units are not 
required to be highly precise, but it is desirable 
that the shaft is not bent or damaged.
When a bearing unit of a set screw type is to 
be used under a general use condition, the fitting 
between the inner ring and the shaft normally 
should be a loose fit for the assembly convenience. 
The appropriate values of the dimensional 
tolerance of the shaft are shown in Fig. 4.
In the case of the adapter sleeve type, 
since the shaft is fastened with a sleeve, the 
dimensional tolerance of the shaft can be h9 
under a general use condition.
As with the set screw type, for the eccentric 
color type under a general use condition, a 
loose fit is generally used for the fitting between 
the inner ring and the shaft for the assembly 
convenience. For the dimensional tolerance 
of the shaft, values indicated in Fig. 5 are 
appropriate.
According to the use condition, when a tight 
fit is to be adopted, proper installation methods 
shall be used and the inner ring side face shall 
not be struck directly to facilitate installation.

9.  Recommended torque of 
setscrew
When bearing units of the set screw type or 
a eccentric collar type are to be attached to a 
shaft, the fastening torque shown in Tables 8 and 
9 is used as a rough standard. For fastening, 
the two setscrews are alternately and uniformly 
fastened. For the details of unit attachment, see 
the special catalog “Bearing units (CAT. No. 
2400/E).”

The NTN plummer blocks are housings for 
spherical roller bearings and self-aligning ball 
bearings. The standard housing is gray cast iron, 
while spheroidal graphite cast iron (ductile cast 
iron) and cast steel, are also available depending 
on the application.
The housings can incorporate rubber seals, 
felt seals, or labyrinth seals depending on the 
application. Grease and oil are both available for 
lubrication.

4.2  Machining accuracy of mounting bolt 
seating end surface
When a large horizontal load is to be applied 
on a plummer block, the fastening force of 
the mounting bolts cannot reliably secure the 
plumber block alone; therefore, the housing 
base should abut a fixed surface. In this case, 
it is effective to use a plummer block with a 
machined vertical face that comes in contact 
with the fixed abutment surface.
Seating length L of a plummer block having 
a machined mounting bolt seating end surface 
is smaller than the standard dimension by the 
machining allowance shown in Table 3 and 
becomes L’ (see Fig. 1). Table 4 shows the 
dimensional tolerance of L’.

Characteristics
The material has resistance to most 
oils and has good abrasion resistance; 
therefore, it is the most used oil seal 
material. The material can be used for 
most conditions of general machines.
The material has good heat resistance 
and oil resistance but poor alkali 
resistance and water resistance; 
therefore, the application is limited.
The material has good heat resistance 
and cold resistance but cannot be used 
for spindle oil and oil containing an 
extreme pressure additive.
The material is not affected by most 
oils and chemicals. The material has 
well-balanced characteristics and can 
be used in a wide range of 
applications; therefore, it is the best oil 
seal material.
Table 6  Rubber seal types and characteristics
Fig. 3  Rubber seal
Fig. 4  Felt seal
Fig. 5  S type seal
External seals have two main functions: to 
prevent lubrication from leaking out and to 
prevent dust, water, and other contaminants 
from entering the bearing.
The sealing device must be selected with the 
following in consideration: the type of lubricant 
(oil or grease) and seal peripheral speed.
A rubber seal or a felt seal is used for the 
contact type, and a labyrinth seal is used for the 
non-contact type. There are also special seals 
suitable for other conditions including heavy 
contamination.
7.1  Contact seal
(1) Rubber seal (Fig. 3)
Since rubber seals are mainly used for grease 
lubrication, a rough standard for the peripheral 
speed is 5 to 6 m/s.
Nitrile rubber is generally used for the rubber 
seal material, and materials shown in Table 6 are 
used depending on the ambient temperature.
(2) Felt seal (Fig. 4)
Felt seals are interchangeable with rubber seals, 
but the use is limited to grease lubrication.
Felt seals are unsuitable for environments 
with a large amount of dust or high humidity, 
and a rough standard for the peripheral speed 
is 4 m/s. The seal is also convenient because it 
can be cut and embedded separately into the 
seal grooves at the upper and lower parts of a 
plummer block.
(3) S type seal (Fig. 5)
The S type seal has excellent sealing 
performance and can be used for grease and 
oil lubrications. Plummer blocks with special 
specifications are used.
A rough standard for the peripheral speed of S 
type seals is 10 to 12 m/s. The shaft roughness 
and hardness of the seal contact area especially 
needs attention.

(3) Shaft design criteria for seal attachment 
part (Table 7)
The hardness and roughness of shafts to be 
attached with seal significantly influences the 
sealing performance; therefore, the design 
criteria shown in the table must be followed.
7.3  Combination seal (Fig. 8)
The combination seal is a sealing device having 
a rubber seal and a labyrinth seal combined to 
the aperture part of a plummer block. It is used 
for environments with a large amount of dirt and 
foreign materials.
Filling the labyrinth voids with grease further 
improves the sealing effect.
7.2  Non-contact seal
(1) Labyrinth seal (Fig. 6)
The labyrinth seal is a seal type that uses a 
labyrinth ring at the aperture part of a plummer 
block.
The labyrinth ring is used with a shaft loose 
fit (h9) and attached with an O ring to allow 
easy attachment and allow for expansion and 
contraction of the shaft.
The labyrinth seal has excellent sealing 
performance and can be used for grease and oil 
lubrications.
(2) Special labyrinth seal (Fig. 7)
The special labyrinth seal shown in the figure is 
especially effective for environments with a large 
amount of contamination such as dirt and sand.
Plummer blocks using this seal have special 
specifications, so consult with NTN Engineering.

Fig. 9  Static breaking strength of SN5 series
Fig. 10  Static breaking strength of SN6 series
The breaking strength of plummer blocks differ 
by the plummer block type, the characteristic 
and direction of the load to be applied, and 
is influenced by the flatness of the mounting 
surfaces. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 shows the general 
fracture loads of static breaking strength of SN5 
and SN6 (S6) series gray cast iron plummer 
blocks.

Table 8  Safety factor of casting plummer block
For horizontal and axial loads, the base end 
surface needs to abut a fixed surface.
For places with especially large impact 
loads or when plummer block damage may 
result in serious accidents, plummer blocks 
made of materials other than gray cast iron 
such as cast steel or spheroidal graphite 
cast iron are available. Please consult NTN 
Engineering.
The downward breaking strength is about 
twice the horizontal breaking strength, and 
the axial breaking strength is about half of the 
horizontal breaking strength.
When selecting plummer blocks, consider the 
safety factor shown in Table 8. The surface to 
be attached with a plummer block must be flat 
without backlash.

●Plummer Blocks
●Plummer Blocks
Note: 2. Dimension x applies to plummer block numbers using one stabilizing ring and indicates the value of deviation from the 
bearing center to the plummer block center. The value is ½ of the width dimension of the stabilizing ring.
1) The stabilizing ring indicates the outer diameter and width dimension.   2) Dimension Y indicates the reference dimension from the shaft 
center to the end in the case of the shaft end shape.     Note: 1. S618 or larger plummer blocks are provided with a lifting eye bolt.

Note: 2. Dimension x applies to plummer block numbers using one stabilizing ring and indicates the value of deviation from the 
bearing center to the plummer block center. The value is ½ of the width dimension of the stabilizing ring.
1) The stabilizing ring indicates the outer diameter and width dimension.   2) Dimension Y indicates the reference dimension 
from the shaft center to the end in the case of the shaft end shape.
Note: 1. SN3028 or larger and SN3126 or larger plummer blocks are provided with a lifting eye bolt.

1) SD3068, SD3072, and SD3076 have the same dimensions as SD3368, SD3372, and SD3376. Therefore, when these models 
are necessary, select “SD3368, SD3372, and SD3376.”
2) Dimension g indicates the bearing width dimension of the floating side. The fixed side (code G) is larger than the bearing 
width dimension by 0.5 mm.
3) Dimension Y indicates the reference dimension from the shaft center to the end in the case of the shaft end shape.

●Plummer Blocks
●Plummer Blocks
Note: 2. Dimension x applies to plummer block numbers using one stabilizing ring and indicates the value of deviation from the 
bearing center to the plummer block center. The value is ½ of the width dimension of the stabilizing ring.

3. Adapters for series 12 bearings can also be used with H2 and H3 series bearings.
1) The stabilizing ring indicates the outer diameter and width dimension.
2) Dimension Y indicates the reference dimension from the shaft center to the end in the case of the shaft end shape.
Note: 1. SV520 or larger plummer blocks are provided with a lifting eye bolt.

●Plummer Blocks
●Plummer Blocks
Note: 2. Dimension x applies to plummer block numbers using one stabilizing ring and indicates the value of deviation from the 
bearing center to the plummer block center. The value is ½ of the width dimension of the stabilizing ring.
1) The stabilizing ring indicates the outer diameter and width dimension.   2) Dimension Y indicates the reference dimension from the shaft 
center to the end in the case of the shaft end shape.        Note: 1. SV220 or larger plummer blocks are provided with a lifting eye bolt.

[How to read the table]  If for example you want to convert 10 kgf to N, find “10” in the middle column of 
the first set of columns. Look in the N column directly to the right of “10,” and you 
will see that 10 kgf equals 98.066 N. Oppositely, to convert 10 N to kgf, look in the 
kgf column to the left of “10” and you will see that 10 N equals 1.0197 kgf.

1kgf＝9.80665N
1N＝0.101972kgf

[How to read the table]  If for example you want to convert 10 kg to lb, find “10” in the 
middle column of the first set of columns. Look in the lb column 
directly to the right of “10,” and you will see that 10 kg equals 
22.046 lb. Oppositely, to convert 10 lb to kg, look in the kg column 
to the left of “10” and you will see that 10 lb equals 4.536 kg.

1kg = 2.2046226 lb
1lb = 0.45359237 kg

[How to read the table]  If for example you want to convert 10°C to °F, find “10” in the middle column of 
the first set of columns. Look in the °F column directly to the right of “10,” and 
you will see that 10°C equals 50.0 °F. Oppositely, to convert 10°F to °C, look 
in the °C column to the left of “10” and you will see that 10°F equals -12.2°C.
[Conversion formula]
  °C = 5 (°F−32)

	 9
  °F 	= 32 + 9 °C
