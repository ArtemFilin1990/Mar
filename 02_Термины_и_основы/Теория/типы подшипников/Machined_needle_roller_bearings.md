Higher cost-effectiveness 
and operational security with X-life
Due to their excellent technical characteristics such as high 
radial load carrying capacity together with their suitability for 
high speeds, single and double row INA machined needle roller 
bearings have been used with outstanding success for decades 
in numerous different applications. With the X-life generation 
of these needle roller bearings, the performance capacity of the 
products up to 120 mm outside diameter has once more been 
significantly increased.
Advantages of the new design
The use of state of the art manufacturing technologies has 
resulted in a better, more uniform surface over the whole contact 
face between the rolling elements and raceway. 
As a result, under identical load there is a significant reduction 
in the stress conditions present on the rolling elements and 
raceway, see Figure 1 and Figure 2. The improved surface quality 
gives reduced friction and lower bearing temperatures, running 
resistance is lower and less strain is placed on the grease.
Taken together, these improvements mean that the basic 
dynamic load ratings Cr are approximately 13% higher than 
the values for the standard design.
As a result, the basic rating life is therefore increased by more 
than 50%; i.e., the operating life of the bearings is considerably 
longer under the same operating conditions, see Figure 3. 
Alternatively, higher loads can now be applied while maintaining 
the same life values.
With their optimised characteristics, X-life needle roller 
bearings open up completely new application prospects, 
such as downsizing of the bearing arrangement. Furthermore, 
the improved price/performance ratio ultimately increases 
the overall cost-effectiveness of the bearing arrangement.

Machined
needle roller bearings
Needle roller bearings with ribs
............................................................................................................................................................ 4
In needle roller bearings with ribs, the outer ring combined with the needle roller 
and cage assembly form a self-retaining unit. These rolling bearings with low radial 
section height and high load carrying capacity are particularly suitable for designs 
with a limited radial design envelope.
The bearings are available with and without an inner ring and in both sealed 
and open versions. 
Bearings without an inner ring are the best solution for bearing arrangements where 
the shaft can be hardened and ground.
Needle roller bearings with inner ring are used if the shaft cannot be configured 
as a rolling bearing raceway.
Needle roller bearings without ribs
........................................................................................................................................................... 26
Needle roller bearings without ribs on the outer ring are not self-retaining. 
This means that the outer ring, needle roller and cage assembly and inner ring 
can be fitted independently of each other. This makes fitting of the bearings 
considerably easier.
Needle roller bearings are available with and without an inner ring and in both 
single and double row versions. 
Bearings without an inner ring are used if the shaft can be hardened and ground.
Aligning needle roller bearings
........................................................................................................................................................... 36
Aligning needle roller bearings have a raceway ring with a spherical outside 
surface and a concave support ring. As a result, they can compensate for static 
misalignment of the bearing axis by up to 3°, but are not suitable for supporting 
swivel or wobble type motion.
The bearings are available with and without an inner ring. 
Bearings without an inner ring are used if the shaft can be hardened and ground.
Combined needle roller bearings
........................................................................................................................................................... 44
Combined needle roller bearings are radial bearings with an axial component 
capable of supporting loads. Combined needle roller bearings are used as 
semi-locating or locating bearings. They do not permit any skewing between 
the shaft and housing.
The bearings are available with and without an inner ring. 
Bearings without an inner ring are used if the shaft can be hardened and ground.

Needle roller bearings with ribs
Features
Needle roller bearings are single or double row units 
comprising machined outer rings with ribs, needle roller and 
cage assemblies and removable inner rings.
Needle roller bearings without inner ring
Bearings without inner rings have particularly compact radial 
dimensions. However, they require a shaft raceway that is 
hardened and ground. The bearings are available in open and 
sealed versions, Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Bearings of type RNA69 are double row units if Fw  40 mm.
Sealing/lubricant
Bearings of type RNA49..-RSR are fitted on one side and 
bearings of type RNA49..-2RSR on both sides with contact seals, 
Figure 2. They are greased with a lithium complex soap grease to 
DIN 51825–KP2N–20 and can be lubricated.
For lubrication, the bearings have a lubrication groove 
and lubrication hole in the outer ring, with the exception of: 
NK with Fw  10 mm.

Needle roller bearings with inner ring
Needle roller bearings with inner ring are used if the shaft 
cannot be configured as a rolling bearing raceway. The bearings 
are available in open and sealed versions, Figure 3 and Figure 4.
Bearings of type NA69 are double row units if d  32 mm.
Sealing/lubricant
Bearings of type NA49..-RSR are fitted on one side and bearings 
of type NA49..-2RSR on both sides with contact seals, Figure 4. 
They are greased with a lithium complex soap grease to 
DIN 51825–KP2N–20 and can be lubricated.
For lubrication, the bearings have a lubrication groove 
and lubrication hole in the outer ring, with the exception of: 
NKI with d  7 mm.
Axial displacement of the inner ring
The standard inner ring allows axial displacement within 
the values “s” stated in the dimension tables. Where larger 
displacements occur, the standard ring can be replaced by 
a wider inner ring IR.

Needle roller bearings with ribs
Operating temperature
Unsealed bearings can be used at operating 
temperatures from –20 °C to +120 °C.
Sealed bearings are suitable for operating temperatures 
from –20 °C to +100 °C; this is limited by the grease 
and seal material.
Cages
The cages made from sheet steel or plastic. Plastic cages have 
the suffix TN.
Before using bearings with plastic cages, check the 
compatibility of the lubricant used with the cage material 
(PA66-GF/H).
Suffixes
Suffixes for the available designs: see table.
1) Available by agreement.
2) Bearings with plastic cage: see dimension tables.
3) Dependent on size.
Design and safety guidelines
Design of bearing arrangements for bearings 
with inner ring
Shaft and housing tolerances for bearings with inner ring: 
see “INA Catalogue 307”.
Raceways for bearings without inner ring
In the case of bearings without an inner ring, the rolling element 
raceway on the shaft must be hardened and ground. 
The surface hardness of the raceway must be 670 HV + 170 HV 
and the hardness depth Eht or Rht must be sufficiently large.
The values apply to housing tolerances up to K7. 
For tighter housing bores, the operating clearance should 
be checked by either calculation or measurement.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure operation without slippage, the bearings must 
be subjected to a minimum radial load Fr min. This applies in 
particular to high speed bearings since, if the radial load is 
insufficient or not present, damaging sliding motion may occur 
between the rolling elements and raceways. 
In continuous operation, therefore, a minimum radial load of 
magnitude Cr/P  50 is necessary.

Speeds
The limiting speeds nG for series RNA49..-RSR (2RSR) and 
NA49..-RSR (2RSR) are valid for grease lubrication.
Sealing rings/wider inner rings
Sealing rings of series G, GR and SD are matched to the bearing 
dimensions and can be combined with wider inner rings 
of series IR. The outer surface of the inner rings can be used as 
the sliding surface for seal lips.
Sealing rings: see “INA publication GSD”.
Radial location
Needle roller bearings with inner ring are radially located by 
means of a close fit on the shaft and in the housing.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must 
be located by means of physical locking, Figure 5 and Figure 6.
The abutting shoulders (shaft, housing) should be sufficiently 
high and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seat to the abutting shoulder 
should be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut 
to DIN 509. The minimum values for the chamfer dimensions r 
as given in the dimension tables must be observed.
The overlap between the snap rings and the end faces of 
the bearing rings must be sufficiently large.
The maximum chamfer dimensions for the inner rings to 
DIN 620-6 must be taken into consideration.

Needle roller bearings with ribs
Accuracy
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances correspond to 
tolerance class PN to DIN 620.
Radial internal clearance
Bearings with inner ring have a radial internal clearance of CN, 
see table “Radial internal clearance”.
Enveloping circle
For bearings without inner ring, the decisive factor is not the 
radial internal clearance but the enveloping circle diameter Fw. 
The enveloping circle is the inner inscribed circle of the needle 
rollers in clearance-free contact with the outer raceway.
For bearings before fitting, the enveloping circle Fw is in 
the tolerance zone F6.

Needle roller bearings without ribs
Features
Needle roller bearings are single or double row units 
comprising machined outer rings without ribs, needle roller and 
cage assemblies and removable inner rings.
The bearings are not self-retaining. This means that the outer 
ring, needle roller and cage assembly and inner ring can 
be fitted independently of each other.
Sealing/lubricant
Needle roller bearings without ribs are unsealed and are not 
supplied greased.
Double row bearings can be lubricated via a lubrication groove 
and lubrication hole in the outer ring.
Needle roller bearings without inner ring
Bearings of type RNAO have particularly compact radial 
dimensions, Figure 1. However, they require a shaft raceway 
that is hardened and ground.
The needle roller and cage assembly can be fitted either 
together with the outer ring or with the shaft. It can also be 
subsequently slid between the outer ring and shaft.
The double row design is indicated by the suffix ZW, 
the lubrication hole and lubrication groove are indicated by 
the suffix ASR1, Figure 2.

29
Needle roller bearings with inner ring
Bearings of type NAO are used if the shaft cannot be configured 
as a rolling bearing raceway, Figure 3.
The needle roller and cage assembly can be fitted either 
together with the outer ring or with the inner ring. It can also 
be subsequently slid between the outer ring and inner ring.
Bearings with a lubrication hole in the inner ring have 
the suffix IS1.
The double row design is indicated by the suffix ZW, 
the lubrication hole and lubrication groove are indicated by 
the suffix ASR1, Figure 4.
Axial displacement of the inner ring
The standard inner ring allows axial displacement within 
the values “s” stated in the dimension tables.
Where larger displacements occur, the standard ring can be 
replaced by a wider inner ring IR.

Needle roller bearings without ribs
Operating temperature
Bearings with plastic cage can be used at operating 
temperatures from –20 °C to +120 °C.
Cages
The cages made from sheet steel or plastic. 
Plastic cages have the suffix TN.
Suffixes
Suffixes for the available designs: see table.
1) Bearings with plastic cage: see dimension tables.
2) Dependent on size.
Design and safety guidelines
Design of bearing arrangements for bearings 
with inner ring
Shaft and housing tolerances for bearings with inner ring: 
see “INA Catalogue 307”.
Raceways for bearings without inner ring
In the case of bearings without an inner ring, the rolling element 
raceway on the shaft must be hardened and ground.
The surface hardness of the raceway must be 670 HV + 170 HV 
and the hardness depth Eht or Rht must be sufficiently large.
The values apply to housing tolerances up to K7. 
For tighter housing bores, the operating clearance should 
be checked by either calculation or measurement.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure operation without slippage, the bearings must 
be subjected to a minimum radial load Fr min. This applies in 
particular to high speed bearings since, if the radial load is 
insufficient or not present, damaging sliding motion may occur 
between the rolling elements and raceways. 
In continuous operation, therefore, a minimum radial load of 
magnitude Cr/P  50 is necessary.
Sealing rings/wider inner rings
Sealing rings of series G, GR and SD are matched to the bearing 
dimensions and can be combined with wider inner rings 
of series IR. The outer surface of the inner rings can be used as 
the sliding surface for seal lips.
Sealing rings: see “INA publication GSD”.
Sealing rings must not be used as running surfaces for 
the cage.

Axial guidance of needle roller and cage assemblies
In bearings without ribs, the needle roller and cage assemblies 
must be axially guided on lateral, burr-free running surfaces, 
see dimension tables.
The axial running surfaces for the cage must be precision 
machined (Ra2) and resistant to wear. The mounting 
dimensions in the dimension tables must be taken into 
consideration.
Radial location
Needle roller bearings with inner ring are radially located by 
means of a close fit on the shaft and in the housing.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must 
be located by means of physical locking.
The abutting shoulders (shaft, housing) should be sufficiently 
high and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seat to the abutting shoulder 
should be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut 
to DIN 509. The minimum values for the chamfer dimensions r 
as given in the dimension tables must be observed.
The overlap between the snap rings and the end faces of 
the bearing rings must be sufficiently large.
The maximum chamfer dimensions for the inner rings to 
DIN 620-6 must be taken into consideration.
Accuracy
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances correspond to 
tolerance class PN to DIN 620.
Radial internal clearance
Bearings with inner ring have a radial internal clearance of CN, 
see table “Radial internal clearance”.
Enveloping circle
For bearings without inner ring, the decisive factor is not the 
radial internal clearance but the enveloping circle diameter Fw.
The enveloping circle is the inner inscribed circle of the needle 
rollers in clearance-free contact with the outer raceway.
For bearings before fitting, the enveloping circle Fw is in 
the tolerance zone F6.
If an F6 tolerance zone is required for the enveloping circle 
diameter, the parts as delivered (outer ring/needle roller 
and cage assembly as a matched pair) must not be 
interchanged with other matched pairs.

Aligning needle roller bearings
Features
Aligning needle roller bearings are units comprising drawn 
outer cups, plastic support rings with a concave inner profile, 
outer rings with a spherical outside surface, needle roller and 
cage assemblies and removable inner rings.
The bearings can compensate static misalignments and can 
thus tolerate misalignment of the shaft relative to the housing; 
see “Compensation of misalignment”, page 39.
Aligning needle roller bearings are firmly seated in the housing 
bore. The bore can therefore be produced easily and 
economically.
Sealing/lubricant
Aligning needle roller bearings without ribs are unsealed 
and are not supplied greased. They can be lubricated with 
grease or oil.
Needle roller bearings with/without inner ring
Bearings of type RPNA do not have an inner ring and are 
therefore particularly compact, Figure 1. However, they require 
a raceway that is hardened and ground.
Bearings of type PNA have an inner ring, Figure 2. They are used 
if the shaft cannot be configured as a rolling bearing raceway.
Displacement of the inner ring
The standard inner ring allows axial displacement within 
the values “s” stated in the dimension tables. Where larger 
displacements occur, the standard ring can be replaced by 
a wider inner ring IR.

39
Operating temperature
Aligning needle roller bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –20 °C to +100 °C, limited by 
the plastic support rings.
Cages
The bearings have sheet steel cages.
Suffixes
Suffixes for the available designs: see table.
Design and safety guidelines
Compensation of misalignment
Due to the spherical outer ring and the concave support ring, 
aligning needle roller bearings can compensate static shaft 
misalignments of up to 3°.
The bearings must not be used to support swivel or 
wobble type motion. During adjustment motion between 
the outer cup and the ring, a breakaway torque occurs.
In order that adjustment motion can take place, 
the tolerances for the housing bore according to the table 
must be observed.
Design of bearing arrangements for bearings 
with inner ring
Shaft and housing tolerances for bearings with inner ring: 
see “INA Catalogue 307”.
Raceways for bearings without inner ring
In the case of bearings without an inner ring, the rolling element 
raceway on the shaft must be hardened and ground. 
The surface hardness of the raceway must be 670 HV + 170 HV 
and the hardness depth Eht or Rht must be sufficiently large.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure operation without slippage, the bearings 
must be subjected to a minimum radial load Fr min. This applies 
in particular to high speed bearings since, if the radial load is 
insufficient or not present, damaging sliding motion may occur 
between the rolling elements and raceways. 
In continuous operation, therefore, a minimum radial load of 
magnitude Cr/P  50 is necessary.
Speeds
The speeds nG in the dimension tables are valid for oil 
lubrication.
With grease lubrication, the permissible value is taken as 
60% of the value given in the table.

Aligning needle roller bearings
Radial and axial location
Aligning needle roller bearings are firmly seated in the housing 
bore. No further axial location is required.
Fitting by means of pressing mandrel
Due to the drawn outer cup, the bearings must be fitted using 
a special pressing mandrel: see the section “Drawn cup needle 
roller bearings” in “INA Catalogue 307”.
The marked side of the bearing should be in contact with 
the flange of the mandrel. A toroidal ring on the mandrel holds 
the bearing securely on the mandrel.
Do not tilt the bearing while it is being pressed in.
Accuracy
Dimensional and geometrical tolerances are in accordance 
with tolerance class PN to DIN 620, apart from the outside 
diameter and width of the outer cup. The width has a tolerance 
of 0,5 mm.
Radial internal clearance
Bearings with inner ring have a radial internal clearance of CN, 
see table “Radial internal clearance”.
Enveloping circle
For bearings without inner ring, the decisive factor is not the 
radial internal clearance but the enveloping circle diameter Fw.
The enveloping circle is the inner inscribed circle of the needle 
rollers in clearance-free contact with the outer raceway.
The enveloping circle Fw before fitting is in the tolerance 
zone F6.

Combined needle roller bearings
Features
Combined needle roller bearings are units comprising radial 
needle roller bearings with a rolling bearing component capable 
of supporting axial loads.
The bearings can support high radial forces as well as axial 
forces in one direction, while bearings of type NKIB can support 
axial forces from both directions, and are used as locating or 
semi-locating bearings, Figure 1.
Needle roller/axial deep groove ball bearings
These bearings do not have an inner ring. Bearings without inner 
ring have particularly compact radial dimensions. 
However, they require a shaft raceway that is hardened and 
ground, see page 48.
Bearings of type NX and NX..-Z have a full complement axial ball 
bearing component with end caps, Figure 2.
Bearings of type NKX (NAXK to DIN 5 429.1) and 
NKX..-Z (NAXK..-Z to DIN 5 429-1) have an axial bearing 
component comprising a ball and cage assembly with a sheet 
steel or plastic cage, Figure 3. Series NKX..-Z also has an end 
cap on the axial bearing component.
Sealing/lubricant
For lubrication, the bearings have a lubrication groove and 
lubrication hole in the outer ring.
Bearings of series NX and NKX are lubricated with oil.
The end cap in series NX has lubrication holes.
Bearings of series NX..-Z and NKX..-Z are lubricated with grease.
The axial bearing component is greased with a lithium complex 
soap grease to DIN 51825–KP2N–20. The end caps do not have 
lubrication holes.

Needle roller/axial cylindrical roller bearings
Bearings of type NKXR (NAXR to DIN 5 429.1) and 
NKXR..-Z (NAXR..-Z to DIN 5 429.1) have an axial bearing 
component comprising a roller and cage assembly with 
a plastic cage; NKXR..-Z also has an end cap on the axial bearing 
component, Figure 4.
These bearings do not have an inner ring. Bearings without inner 
ring have particularly compact radial dimensions. 
However, they require a shaft raceway that is hardened and 
ground, see page 48.
Sealing/lubricant
For lubrication, the bearings have a lubrication groove and 
lubrication hole in the outer ring.
Bearings of series NKXR are lubricated with oil.
Bearings of series NKXR..-Z are lubricated with grease. 
The axial bearing component is greased with a lithium complex 
soap grease to DIN 51825–KP2N–20. The end cap does not 
have lubrication holes.
Needle roller/angular contact ball bearings
Combined bearings of type NKIA and NKIB have an inner ring.
Series NKIA corresponds to DIN 5 429-2. It can support axial 
loads in one direction, Figure 5.
Series NKIB have one narrow and one wide inner ring, Figure 6.
The axial bearing component has a plastic ball cage. At the point 
where the inner rings join, there is a shoulder on both sides 
for guidance of the ball and cage assembly. As a result, these 
bearings are also suitable for supporting axial forces alternating 
in direction. The bearings guide the shaft with an axial clearance 
of 0,08 mm to 0,25 mm.
Sealing/lubricant
Bearings of type NKIA and NKIB can be lubricated with grease or 
oil.
For lubrication, the outer ring has a lubrication groove and 
a lubrication hole.

Raceways for bearings without inner ring
In the case of bearings without an inner ring, the rolling element 
raceway on the shaft must be hardened and ground. 
The surface hardness of the raceway must be 670 HV + 170 HV 
and the hardness depth Eht or Rht must be sufficiently large.
For bearings NKIA and NKIB, the shaft tolerance must not 
be greater than k6 and the bore tolerance must not be less 
than M6.
If the shaft cannot be configured as a raceway, inner rings 
of series IR or LR can be used. The inner rings must be ordered 
separately.

Support of axial forces
The axial bearing component must be preloaded to 1% of 
the axial basic static load rating C0a. The basic load ratings C0a 
are stated in the dimension tables.
Needle roller/axial deep groove ball bearings, 
needle roller/axial cylindrical roller bearings
In order to support axial forces, the bearing must be abutted by 
means of snap rings on the outer ring or a housing shoulder.
If there is little distance between the shaft centres, the snap 
rings should be shortened. Snap rings WR and SW are available 
from trade outlets.
If the bearings are to support axial forces from alternating 
directions, two bearings must be fitted opposed to each other. 
The unloaded bearing must be axially preloaded, for example 
by means of springs. This allows compensation of thermal 
expansion.
In order to avoid double fits on NKX and NKXR bearings, 
the axial bearing component should be free in the housing 
(outside diameter D1 or D2 + 0,5 mm min.).
Needle roller/angular contact ball bearings
Bearings of type NKIA can support axial forces in one direction, 
bearings of type NKIB can support axial forces in both 
directions.
If bearings of type NKIA are to support axial forces from 
alternating directions, two bearings must be fitted opposed to 
each other, Figure 7.
In the case of bearing type NKIB, the wide and narrow inner ring 
must be axially clamped against each other. The narrow inner 
ring has a larger bore diameter. This results in an interference fit 
if a shaft tolerance of k6 is used. The bearings guide the shaft 
with an axial clearance of between 0,08 mm and 0,25 mm.
Axial static load safety factor
The axial static load safety factor S0 must be  1,5.
The axial load must not exceed 1/4 of the radial load.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure operation without slippage, the bearings 
must be subjected to a minimum radial load Fr min. This applies 
in particular to high speed bearings since, if the radial load is 
insufficient or not present, damaging sliding motion may occur 
between the rolling elements and raceways. 
In continuous operation, therefore, a minimum radial load of 
magnitude Cr/P  50 is necessary.

Combined needle roller bearings
Speeds
The speeds nG in the dimension tables are valid for oil 
lubrication. 
With grease lubrication, the permissible value is taken as 
60% of the value given in the table. 
Für bearings of type NKXR, NKXR..-Z, NKIA, NKIB, 
the reference speed nB is stated in the dimension tables. 
In order to calculate the thermally safe speed nper, 
NKXR(Z) must be regarded as an axial bearing and NKIA, 
NKIB must be regarded as radial bearings.
Radial location
Combined needle roller bearings with inner ring are radially 
located by means of a close fit on the shaft and in the housing.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must 
be located by means of physical locking.
The abutting shoulders (shaft, housing) should be sufficiently 
high and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seat to the abutting shoulder 
should be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut 
to DIN 509. The minimum values for the chamfer dimensions r 
as given in the dimension tables must be observed.
The overlap between the snap rings and the end faces of 
the bearing rings must be sufficiently large.
The maximum chamfer dimensions for the inner rings to 
DIN 620-6 must be taken into consideration.
Lubrication
Before operation, the radial component should be greased 
using a grease of similar quality to that used in the axial 
component.
In order to determine the relubrication interval, values must 
be calculated separately for the axial and radial component and 
the lower value should be used.
Accuracy
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances correspond to 
tolerance class PN to DIN 620. This excludes bearings of 
type NKIB in relation to the bore d1 of the narrow inner ring 
and the width (–0,3 mm) over both inner rings and bearings of 
type NKX and NKXR in relation to the diameters D1, D2.
Radial internal clearance
Bearings with inner ring have a radial internal clearance of CN, 
see table “Radial internal clearance”.
Enveloping circle
For bearings without inner ring, the decisive factor is not the 
radial internal clearance but the enveloping circle diameter Fw.
The enveloping circle is the inner inscribed circle of the needle 
rollers in clearance-free contact with the outer raceway.
For bearings before fitting, the enveloping circle Fw is in 
the tolerance zone F6.
