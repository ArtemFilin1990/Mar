■Structure and Features
IKO Crossed Roller Bearings are compact bearings 
with their rollers alternately crossed at right angles to 
each other between inner and outer rings.  They can 
take loads from any directions at the same time such 
as radial, thrust and moment loads.  The rollers make 
line-contact with raceway surfaces, and, therefore, 
elastic deformation due to bearing loads is very small.
These bearings are widely used in the rotating parts 
of industrial robots, machine tools, medical equip-
ment, etc., which require compactness, high rigidity 
and high rotational accuracy.
In addition, bearings made of stainless steel or those 
with inner and outer rings provided with mounting 
holes are also available on request.  Please contact 
IKO.

■Types
Crossed Roller Bearings are available in the types 
shown in Table 1.
High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller Bearings V
Both inner and outer rings have a solid one-piece 
construction.  Therefore, high accuracy and high rigid-
ity are achieved, and mounting errors can be mini-
mized.  As separators are incorporated between the 
cylindrical rollers for smooth rotation, these bearings 
are suitable for applications where rotational speed is 
comparatively high.
Mounting Holed Type
High Rigidity Crossed Roller Bearings
Mounting holes are prepared on outer ring and inner 
ring providing easy mounting together with high rigidity 
and high accuracy.
Standard Type Crossed Roller Bearings
The outer ring is made of two split pieces, which are 
bolted together to prevent separation during trans-
portation or mounting.  So, handling is easy.
Super Slim Type Crossed Roller Bearings
This Type is extremely compact bearing having 
5.5mm of sectional height and 5mm of width. 
Separators are incorporated between Cylindrical 
rollers for smooth rotation. These compactness, light-
ness and smoothness contribute downsizing of the 
machine and saving driving power.
Mounting Holed Type Super Slim Crossed 
Roller Bearings
These bearings are extremely compact and light-
weight at a width of just 5 mm, with both outer and 
inner rings integrated (non-separable), and mounting 
holes in the rings for easy mounting to equipment.
Slim Type Crossed Roller Bearings
These bearings are slim bearings having a small out-
side diameter, in comparison with the bore diameter, 
and a narrow width.  The type with cage and the type 
with separator provide smooth rotation and are suit-
able for applications where rotational speed is com-
paratively high.

High rigidity and high accuracy
The world's thinnest roller type!
Very low cross sectional height of 5.5 mm
Significant weight saving by 38% in comparison 
with conventional types was realized
Weight reduction is thoroughly pursued.  The mass 
ratio is 0.38 and significant weight saving was 
realized in comparison with conventional slim type 
CRBS (bearing bore diameter 50 mm).
■Features of Mounting Holed Type Crossed Roller Bearings　CRBFV, CRBTF
The single structure to reduce the mounting errors is 
adopted for both inner and outer rings.  Further, 
mounting holes for direct fixing on mating mounting 
surface are available. So high rigidity and high accuracy 
guide can be easily realized, being less subject to the 
structure of the housing and the accuracy.
Contributing to miniaturization
It can be easily mounted to a device with bolts without 
need for housing and fixing plate, so surrounding 
parts of the bearing can be made compact.
Further, it allows for reduction of the number of parts 
and assembly processes, which contributes to 
miniaturization and weight saving of devices.
The cross sectional height is reduced by 69% in 
comparison with CRBS, which was  
the thinnest before (bearing  
bore diameter 50 mm).
The width is also as small  
as 5 mm and the cross  
sectional area is reduced  
by 43% in comparison with  
conventional products.

■Fit
The standard fits of Crossed Roller Bearings are shown 
in Table 12.1, and recommended fits for Slim Type 
Crossed Roller Bearings with normal clearances are 
shown in Table 12.2. For Super Slim Type Crossed 
Roller Bearings, it is recommended to use a slight inter-
ference fit adjusted to the actual measured dimensions. 
For large bearings, fit based on the actual measured 
dimensions of the bearings is recommended, and fit 
allowance should be chosen as small as possible in 
accordance with the tolerance class given in Table 
12.1.  When complex loads or shock loads are applied 
or when high rotational accuracy and rigidity of the 
bearing are required, it is recommended to use a slight 
interference fit adjusted to the actual measured dimen-
sions for both inner and outer rings.
For the interference fit, the radial internal clearance 
after the fit decreases by approximately 70% to 90% 
of the interference amount.  To avoid excessive pre-
load due to fit, it is recommended to use a slight inter-
ference fit adjusted to the actual measured dimen-
sions for both T1 and C1 clearances.

■Allowable rotational speed
Allowable rotational speeds of Crossed Roller 
Bearings are affected by mounting and operating con-

■Rotational torque
Rotational torque of IKO Crossed Roller Bearings are 
lower than that of plain bearings and the difference 
between the static torque and the dynamic (kinetic) 
torque is small.  Therefore, these bearings minimize 
power consumption and operating temperature rise of 
machinery and increase the overall efficiency of 
machines.
The rotational torque is affected by many factors, but 
the following equations can be used expediently.
                 Dpw
T ＝μP0r———
                    2
  where,	 T	 ： Rotational torque,　N・mm

μ	 ： Friction coefficient (Approx. 0.010)

P0r	 ： Static equivalent radial load,　N

 Dpw	： Pitch circle diameter,　mm
             d ＋D
Dpw ≒————
                  2
■Lubrication
These bearings are generally lubricated with grease. 
Grease is supplied through the clearance between the 
inner ring and the outer ring.
Grease specification is shown in Table 14, ALVANIA 
GREASE EP2 (Shell Lubricants Japan K.K.) is 
prepacked as the lubricating grease.
For bearings without prepacked grease, supply grease 
or oil for use.  Operating without grease or oil will increase 
the wear of the rolling contact surfaces and cause a short 
bearing life.
Table 14  Bearings with prepacked grease
○：With prepacked grease 　　×：Without prepacked grease
When using a special grease, carefully examine the 
grease properties and contents such as base oil vis-
cosity and extreme pressure additives.  In this case, 
please contact IKO.
■Oil Hole
For Crossed Roller Bearings, oil holes and oil grooves can be 
provided on bearing rings if requested. Not applicable to the 
Super Slim Type (Mounting Holed Type). When an oil hole is 
required on the outer ring, attach "-OH" before the clearance 
symbol in the identification number. When an oil hole and an oil 
groove are required on the outer ring, attach "-OG" at the same 
place in the identification number. For an oil hole on the inner 
ring, attach "/OH", and for an oil hole and an oil groove on the 
inner ring, attach "/OG", at the same place in the identification 
number. High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller Bearings V and 
Mounting Holed Type High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller 
Bearings V have an oil groove and two oil holes on the outer 
ring as standard. Table 15 shows availability of oil holes for 
each bearing type.
Table 15  Oil holes 
Notes(1)　CRBHV … A and CRBFV … A are provided with an oil 
groove and two oil holes on the outer ring.
Remark　 n denotes the number of oil holes not exceeding 4.  For 
one oil hole, number is not indicated.
When preparing multiple oil holes, please contact IKO.

When the rigidity of the mounting parts is not suffi-
cient, stress concentration will occur at the contact 
area between the rollers and raceways, and the bear-
ing performance will be deteriorated significantly.
Therefore, it is necessary to carefully examine the 
rigidity of housing and the strength of fixing bolts 
when a large moment will be applied.
The shoulder height diameters (da and Da) that are 
related to mounting should certainly satisfy the values 
shown in the dimension tables.  When these dimen-
sions are incorrect, deformations of inner and outer 
rings will occur and the bearing performance will be 
deteriorated remarkably.
Fig. 2  Mounting example
●
1 The inner and outer rings should be securely fixed 
in the axial direction by using fixing plates, etc. 
Recommended thickness of the fixing plate is 1/2 or 
more of the bearing width B.  The dimensions in the 
axial direction of the housing bore and the fixing

Crossed Roller Bearings V
●
1 Mounting Holed Type High Rigidity Crossed Roller 
Bearings V, Mounting Holed Type Super Slim Crossed 
Roller Bearings can be mounted directly to the mount-
ing surface by fixing bolts.  (See Fig. 3, Fig. 4)
●
2 If large number of radial load and/or moment is 
expected, it is recommended to prepare flange part. 
(See Fig.5)
●
3 Mounting Holed Type High Rigidity Crossed Roller 
Bearings V, Mounting Holed Type Super Slim Crossed 
Roller Bearings have a plug for hole for inserting cylin-
drical rollers. When mounting the bearings, locate the 
plug at a position that is not included in the maximum 
loading zone. The plug location can be found by the 
pin pressed at the side of the outer ring.
■Operating Temperature Range
The operating temperature range for Crossed Roller 
Bearings is −20℃〜＋120℃.  However, the maxi-
mum allowable temperature for types with separator 
and with seal is ＋110℃, and ＋100℃ when they are 
continuously operated.
Example 1　 When the inner ring has 4 oil holes
　　　CRBC  10020  /  4OH  C1

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　4 Oil holes 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　In inner ring
Example 2　 When the outer ring has a single oil hole
　　　CRBC  10020   -   OH  C1
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1 Oil hole 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　In outer ring
plates should be determined to get a secure fixing 
while considering the dimension of bearing width 
which is given a minus tolerance. (See Fig.2)
●
2 The depth of the housing bore is recommended to 
be equal to or larger than the bearing width.
●
3 Separation prevention bolts for the outer ring of 
Standard Type Crossed Roller Bearings are provided 
to prevent separation of two halves of the outer ring 
during transportation or mounting.  When mounting, 
they should be loosened slightly.
●
4 High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller Bearings V, Super 
Slim Type Crossed Roller Bearings and Slim Type 
Crossed Roller Bearings have a plug for hole for 
inserting rollers. When mounting the bearings, locate 
the plug at a position that is not included in the maxi-
mum loading zone. The plug location can be found by 
the pin pressed at the side of the outer ring.
■Tightening torque of mounting bolts
The standard tightening torque values for Mounting 
Holed Type High Rigidity Crossed Roller Bearings V, 
Mounting Holed Type Super Slim Crossed Roller 
Bearings mounting bolts are shown in Table 16. When 
machines or equipment are subjected to severe vibra-
tion, shock, large fluctuating load, or moment load, the 
bolts should be tightened with a torque 1.2 to 1.5 
times higher than the standard torque values shown. 
If the mating member material is cast iron or alumi-
num, reduce the tightening torque depending on the 
strength characteristics of the mating member materi-
al. 
Please do not tighten with too much torque as abnor-
mal frictional torque or short life may occur.
■Double Row Angular Contact Roller Bearing
We manufacture Double Row Angular Contact Roller 
Bearings to order. If needed, please contact IKO. 
Double Row Angular Contact Roller Bearings have a 
large number of cylindrical rollers with a large contact 
area with a raceway and an excellent load capability, 
between the inner and outer rings arranged in a dou-
ble row of raceways. This underpins even higher rigidi-
ty and lower torque than High Rigidity Type Crossed 
Roller Bearings V. 
The mounting holes in both inner and outer rings facil-
itate installation to your machines and equipment. 
Further, the integrated structure (non split) construct-
ed in both inner and outer rings can avoid installation 
errors, yielding extra-high-rigidity and high-accuracy 
guiding performance without being affected by other 
peripheral structures such as housing or pressure 
plate.
For lubrication, use the two oil holes on the outer ring 
outer surface shown in Fig. 6.
