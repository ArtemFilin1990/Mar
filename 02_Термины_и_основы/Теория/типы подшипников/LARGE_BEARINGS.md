1.  Load Rating and Life
1.1  Bearing life
Even in bearings operating under normal conditions, the
surfaces of the raceway and rolling elements are
constantly being subjected to repeated compressive
stresses which cause flaking of these surfaces to occur.
This flaking is due to material fatigue and will eventually
cause the bearings to fail.  The effective life of a bearing
is usually defined in terms of the total number of
revolutions a bearing can undergo before flaking of either
the raceway surface or the rolling element surfaces
occurs.
Other causes of bearing failure are often attributed to
problems such as seizing, abrasions, cracking, chipping,
gnawing, rust, etc.  However, these so called "causes" of
bearing failure are usually themselves caused by
improper installation, insufficient or improper lubrication,
faulty sealing or inaccurate bearing selection. Since the
above mentioned "causes" of bearing failure can be
avoided by taking the proper precautions, and are not
simply caused by material fatigue, they are considered
separately from the flaking aspect.
1.2  Basic rated life and basic dynamic load rating
A group of seemingly identical bearings when subjected
to identical load and operating conditions will exhibit a
wide diversity in their durability.
This "life" disparity can be accounted for by the
difference in the fatigue of the bearing material itself.
This disparity is considered statistically when calculating
bearing life, and the basic rated life is defined as follows.
The basic rated life is based on a 90% statistical model
which is expressed as the total number of revolutions
90% of the bearings in an identical group of bearings
subjected to identical operating conditions will attain or
surpass before flaking due to material fatigue occurs.  For
bearings operating at fixed constant speeds, the basic
rated life (90% reliability) is expressed in the total number
of hours of operation.
The basic dynamic load rating is an expression of the
load capacity of a bearing based on a constant load
which the bearing can sustain for one million revolutions
(the basic life rating).  For radial bearings this rating
applies to pure radial loads, and for thrust bearings it
refers to pure axial loads.  The basic dynamic load ratings
given in the bearing tables of this catalog are for bearings
constructed of NTN standard bearing materials, using
standard manufacturing techniques. Please consult NTN
Engineering for basic load ratings of bearings constructed of
special materials or using special manufacturing techniques.
The relationship between the basic rated life, the basic
dynamic load rating and the bearing load is given in
formula (1.1).

When several bearings are incorporated in machines
or equipment as complete units, all the bearings in the
unit are considered as a whole when computing bearing
life (see formula 1.6).  The total bearing life of the unit is
a life rating based on the viable lifetime of the unit before
even one of the bearings fails due to rolling contact
fatigue.

1.3  Adjusted life rating factor
The basic bearing life rating (90% reliability factor) can
be calculated through the formulas mentioned earlier in
Section 1.2.  However, in some applications a bearing life
factor of over 90% reliability may be required.  To meet
these requirements, bearing life can be lengthened by the
use of specially improved bearing materials or special
construction techniques. Moreover, according to
elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, it is clear that the
bearing operating conditions (lubrication, temperature,
shaft speed, etc.) all exert an effect on bearing life.  All
these adjustment factors are taken into consideration
when calculating bearing life, and using the life
adjustment factor as prescribed in ISO 281, the adjusted
bearing life can be determined.

where,
Lna : Adjusted life rating in millions of revolutions 
(10

operating conditions)
a1 : Reliability adjustment factor
a2 : Material adjustment factor
a3:Operating condition adjustment factor
1.3.1  Life adjustment factor for reliability a1
The values for the reliability adjustment factor a1 (for a
reliability factor higher than 90%) can be found in Table
1.1.
1.3.2  Life adjustment factor for material a2
The life of a bearing is affected by the material type and
quality as well as the manufacturing process. In this
regard, the life is adjusted by the use of an a2 factor.
The basic dynamic load ratings listed in the catalog are
based on NTN's standard material and manufacturing
processes, therefore, the adjustment factor a2=1. When
special materials or processes are used the adjustment
factor can be larger than 1.
NTN bearings can generally be used up to 120˚C. If
bearings are operated at a higher temperature, the
bearing must be specially heat treated (stabilized) so that
inadmissible dimensional change does not occur due to
changes in the micro-structure. This special heat
treatment might cause the reduction of bearing life
because of a hardness change.
1.3.3  Life adjustment factor a3 for operating conditions
The operating conditions life adjustment factor a3 is
used to adjust for such conditions as lubrication,
operating temperature, and other operation factors which
have an effect on bearing life.
Generally speaking, when lubricating conditions are
satisfactory, the a3 factor has a value of one; and when
lubricating conditions are exceptionally favorable, and all
other operating conditions are normal, a3 can have a
value greater than one.
However, when lubricating conditions are particularly
unfavorable and the oil film formation on the contact
surfaces of the raceway and rolling elements is
insufficient, the value of a3 becomes less than one. This
insufficient oil film formation can be caused, for example,
by the lubricating oil viscosity being too low for the
operating temperature (below 13 mm2/s for ball bearings;
below 20 mm2/s for roller bearings); or by exceptionally
low rotational speed (nmin-1 x dpmm less than 10,000).
For bearings used under special operating conditions,
please consult NTN Engineering.
As the operating temperature of the bearing increases,
the hardness of the bearing material decreases. Thus, the
bearing life correspondingly decreases. The operating
temperature adjustment values are shown in Fig. 1.2.

1.4  Basic static load rating
When stationary rolling bearings are subjected to static
loads, they suffer from partial permanent deformation of
the contact surfaces at the contact point between the
rolling elements and the raceway.  The amount of
deformity increases as the load increases, and if this
increase in load exceeds certain limits, the subsequent
smooth operation of the bearings is impaired.
It has been found through experience that a permanent
deformity of 0.0001 times the diameter of the rolling
element, occurring at the most heavily stressed contact
point between the raceway and the rolling elements, can
be tolerated without any impairment in running efficiency.
The basic rated static load refers to a fixed static load
limit at which a specified amount of permanent
deformation occurs. It applies to pure radial loads for
radial bearings and to pure axial loads for thrust bearings.
The maximum applied load values for contact stress
occurring at the rolling element and raceway contact
points are given below.
For ball bearings
4,200 Mpa
(except self-aligning ball bearings)
For self-aligning ball bearings
4,600 Mpa
For roller bearings
4,000 Mpa
1.5  Allowable static equivalent load
Generally the static equivalent load which can be
permitted (See Section 2.3.2 page A-9) is limited by the
basic static rated load as stated in Section 1.4.
However, depending on requirements regarding friction
and smooth operation, these limits may be greater or
lesser than the basic static rated load.
In the following formula (1.9) and Table 1.2 the safety
factor So can be determined considering the maximum
static equivalent load.
So =Co／Po…（1.9）
where,
So : Safety factor
Co : Basic static rated load, N
(radial bearings: Cor, thrust bearings: Coa)

           3. When vibration and/or shock loads are present, a load factor
               based on the shock load needs to be included in the P0 max value.
           4. If a large axial load is applied to deep groove ball bearings or 
               angular ball bearings, the contact oval may exceed the raceway 
               surface. For more information, please contact NTN Engineering.

●Bearing Load Calculation

2.  Bearing Load Calculation
2.2  Mean load
The load on bearings used in machines under normal
circumstances will, in many cases, fluctuate according to
a fixed time period or planned operation schedule. The
load on bearings operating under such conditions can be
converted to a mean load (Fm), this is a load which gives
bearings the same life they would have under constant
operating conditions.
(1) Fluctuating stepped load 
The mean bearing load, Fm, for stepped loads is
calculated from formula (2.2). F1 , F2 ....... Fn are the
loads acting on the bearing; n1, n2.......nn and t1, t2....... tn
are the bearing speeds and operating times
respectively.
(2) Consecutive series load
Where it is possible to express the function F(t) in terms
of load cycle to and time t, the mean load is found by
using formula (2.3).

The mean load, Fm, can be approximated by formula
(2.4).

To compute bearing loads, the forces which act on the
shaft being supported by the bearing must be determined.
These forces include the inherent dead weight of the
rotating body (the weight of the shafts and components
themselves), loads generated by the working forces of the
machine, and loads arising from transmitted power.
It is possible to calculate theoretical values for these
loads; however, there are many instances where the load
acting on the bearing is usually determined by the nature
of the load acting on the main power transmission shaft.
2.1   Load acting on shafts
2.1.1  Load factor
There are many instances where the actual operational
shaft load is much greater than the theoretically
calculated load, due to machine vibration and/or shock.
This actual shaft load can be found by using formula (2.1)
K＝fw・Kc…（2.1）
where:

(2) Dynamic equivalent axial load
As a rule, standard thrust bearings with a contact angle
of 90˚ cannot carry radial loads. However, self-aligning
thrust roller bearings can accept some radial load. The
dynamic equivalent axial load for these bearings is
given in formula (2.8).
Pa＝Fa＋1.2Fr………………（2.8）
where,
Pa：Dynamic equivalent axial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
Fr：Actual radial load,   N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦0.55 only.
2.3.2 Static equivalent load
The static equivalent load is a hypothetical load which
would cause the same total permanent deformation at the
most heavily stressed contact point between the rolling
elements and the raceway as under actual load
conditions; that is when both static radial loads and static
axial loads are simultaneously applied to the bearing.
For radial bearings this hypothetical load refers to pure
radial loads, and for thrust bearings it refers to pure
centric axial loads.  These loads are designated static
equivalent radial loads and static equivalent axial loads
respectively.
(1) Static equivalent radial load
For radial bearings the static equivalent radial load can
be found by using formula (2.9) or (2.10). The greater of
the two resultant values is always taken for Por.
Por＝Xo Fr＋Yo Fa… （2.9）
Por＝Fr…………… （2.10）
where,
Por：Static equivalent radial load,   N
Fr ：Actual radial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
Xo：Static radial load factor
Yo：Static axial load factor
The values for Xo and Yo are given in the respective
bearing tables.
(2) Static equivalent axial load
For spherical thrust roller bearings the static equivalent
axial load is expressed by formula (2.11).
Poa＝Fa＋2.7Fr…（2.11）
where,
Poa：Static equivalent axial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
Fr ：Actual radial load,   N
Provided that Fr / Fa ≦0.55 only.
2.3   Equivalent load
2.3.1  Dynamic equivalent load
When both dynamic radial loads and dynamic axial
loads act on a bearing at the same time, the hypothetical
load acting on the center of the bearing giving the
bearings the same life as if they had only a radial load or
only an axial load, is called the dynamic equivalent load.
For radial bearings, this load is expressed as pure
radial load and is called the dynamic equivalent radial
load. For thrust bearings, it is expressed as pure axial
load and is called the dynamic equivalent axial load.
(1) Dynamic equivalent radial load
The dynamic equivalent radial load is expressed by
formula (2.7).
Pr＝XFr＋YFa………………（2.7）
where, 
Pr：Dynamic equivalent radial load,   N
Fr：Actual radial load,   N
Fa：Actual axial load,   N
X ：Radial load factor
Y ：Axial load factor
The values for X and Y are listed in the bearing tables.

●Bearing Tolerances
3.1 Dimensional accuracy and running accuracy
Bearing “tolerances” or dimensional accuracy and
running accuracy, are regulated by ISO and JIS B 1514
standards (rolling bearing tolerances). For dimensional
accuracy, these standards prescribe the tolerances
necessary when installing bearings on shafts or in
housings. Running accuracy is defined as the allowable
limits for bearing runout during operation. 
Dimensional accuracy
Dimensional accuracy constitutes the acceptable values
for bore diameter, outer diameter, assembled bearing
width, and bore diameter uniformity as seen in chamfer
dimensions, allowable inner ring tapered bore deviation
and shape error. Also included are, average bore diameter
variation average, outer diameter variation, average outer
diameter unevenness, as well as raceway width and
height variation (for thrust bearings).
Running accuracy
Running accuracy constitutes the acceptable values for
inner and outer ring radial runout and axial runout, inner
ring side runout, and outer ring outer diameter runout.
Allowable rolling bearing tolerances have been
established according to precision classes. JIS Class 0
corresponds to normal precision class bearings, and
precision becomes progressively higher as the class
number becomes smaller; i.e., Class 6 is less precise than
Class 5, which is less precise than Class 4, and so on.
Table 3.1 indicates which standards and precision
classes are applicable to the major bearing types. Table
3.2 shows a relative comparison between JIS B 1514
precision class standards and other standards. For greater
detail on allowable error limitations and values, refer to
Tables 3.3 - 3.8. Allowable values for chamfer dimensions
are shown in Table 3.9, and allowable error limitations and
values for radial bearing inner ring tapered bores are
shown in Table 3.10.

1 "ABEC" is applied for ball bearings and "RBEC" for roller bearings.
Notes: 1. JIS B 1514, ISO 492 and 199, and DIN 620 have the same specification level.
            2. The tolerance and allowance of JIS B 1514 are a little different from those of ABMA standards.

●Bearing Fits 
¡Raceway cracking, early peeling and displacement of
raceway
¡Raceway and shaft or housing abrasion caused by
creeping and fretting corrosion
¡Seizing caused by loss of internal clearances
¡Increased noise and lowered rotational accuracy due
to raceway groove deformation
4.3 Fit selection
Selection of a proper fit is dependent upon thorough
analysis of bearing operating conditions, including
consideration of:
¡Shaft and housing material, wall thickness, finished
surface accuracy, etc. 
¡Machinery operating conditions (nature and
magnitude of load, rotational speed, temperature,
etc.)
4.3.1 "Tight fit," "transition fit," or  "loose fit"
(1) For raceways under rotating loads, a tight fit is
necessary. (refer to Table 4.1) "Raceways under
rotating loads" refers to raceways receiving loads
rotating relative to their radial direction. For raceways
under static loads, on the other hand, a loose fit is
sufficient.
(Example) Rotating inner ring load = the direction of
the radial load on the inner ring is rotating
relatively
(2) For non-separable bearings, such as deep groove ball
bearings, it is generally recommended that either the
inner ring or outer ring be given a loose fit. 
4.1 Interference
For rolling bearings, inner and outer rings are fixed on
the shaft or in the housing so that relative movement
does not occur between fitted surfaces during operation
or under load. This relative movement (referred to as
"creep") between the fitted surfaces of the bearing and
the shaft or housing can occur in a radial direction, an
axial direction, or in the direction of rotation. To help
prevent this creeping movement, bearing rings and the
shaft or housing are installed with one of three
interference fits, a "tight fit" (also called shrink fit),
"transition fit," or "loose fit" (also called clearance fit),
and the degree of interference between their fitted
surfaces varies.
The most effective way to fix the fitted surfaces
between a bearing's raceway and shaft or housing is to
apply a "tight fit." The advantage of this tight fit for thin
walled bearings is that it provides uniform load support
over the entire ring circumference without any loss of load
carrying capacity. However, with a tight fit, ease of
installation and disassembly is lost; and when using a
non-separable bearing as the floating-side bearing, axial
displacement is not possible. For this reason, a tight fit
cannot be recommended in all cases.
4.2 The necessity of a proper fit
In some cases, improper fit may lead to damage and
shorten bearing life, therefore it is necessary to make a
careful analysis in selecting a proper fit. Some of the
negative conditions caused by improper fit are listed
below.

●Bearing Fits 
A-23
4.3.2 Recommended Fits
Bearing fit is governed by the selection tolerances for
bearing shaft diameters and housing bore diameters. 
Widely used fits for 0 Class tolerance bearings and
various shaft and housing bore diameter tolerances are
shown in Fig. 4.1.
Generally-used, standard fits for most types of bearings
and operating conditions are shown in Tables 4.2 - 4.6.
Table 4.2: Fits for radial bearings
Table 4.3: Fits for thrust bearings
Table 4.4: Fits for electric motor bearings
Table 4.5: Fits for inch series tapered roller bearings
(ANSI Class 4)
Table 4.6: Fits for inch series tapered roller bearings
(ANSI Class 3 and 0)
Table 4.5. shows fits and their numerical values.
For special fits or applications, please consult NTN
Engineering. 
4.3.3 Interference minimum and maximum values
The following points should be considered when it is
necessary to calculate the interference for an application:
¡In calculating the minimum required amount of
interference keep in mind that:
1) interference is reduced by radial loads
2) interference is reduced by differences between
bearing temperature and ambient temperature
3) interference is reduced by variation of fitted
surfaces
¡Maximum interference should be no more than
1:1000 of the shaft diameter or outer diameter. 
Required interference calculations are shown below. 
(1) Radial loads and required interference 
Interference between inner rings mounted on solid
shafts is reduced when acted upon by radial loads.
Calculation of the minimum required amount of
interference in such cases is shown in formulae (4.1) and
(4.2).

｛kgf ｝
Where,
∆dF : Required effective interference for load μm
d : Nominal bore diameter mm
B : Inner ring width mm
Fr : Radial load N｛kgf｝
Cor : Basic static rated load N｛kgf｝
(2) Temperature difference and required interference
Interference between inner rings and steel shafts is
reduced as a result of temperature increases (difference
between bearing temperature and ambient temperature,
∆T) caused by bearing rotation. Calculation of the
minimum required amount of interference in such cases is

∆dT = 0.0015 d ∆T ……………………………………(4.3)
∆dT : Required effective interference for
temperature difference μm
∆T : Difference between bearing temperature
and ambient temperature ˚C
d : Bearing bore diameter mm
(3) Fitted surface variation and required interference
Interference between fitted surfaces is reduced by
roughness and other slight variations of these surfaces
which are flattened in the fitting process. The degree of
reduced interference depends upon the finish treatment
of these surfaces, but in general it is necessary to
assume the following interference reductions.
For ground shafts: 1.0～2.5μm
For lathed shafts: 5.0～7.0μm
(4) Maximum interference
When bearing rings are installed with an interference fit,
tension or compression stress may occur along their
raceways. If interference is too great, this may cause
damage to the rings and reduce bearing life. For these
reasons, maximum interference should not exceed the
previously mentioned ratio of 1:1,000 of shaft or outside
diameter. 
4.3.4 Other details
(1) Tight interference fits are recommended for,
¡Operating conditions with large vibration or shock
loads
¡Applications using hollow shafts or housings with
thin walls
¡Applications using housings made of light alloys or
plastic
(2) Loose interference fits are preferable for,
¡Applications requiring high running accuracy
¡Applications using small sized bearings or thin
walled bearings

fit is not a consideration with single-row angular
contact bearings and tapered roller bearings.
Therefore, k5 and m5 may be substituted for
k6 and m6.
When greater accuracy is required use g5.
For large bearings, f6 may be used.
When greater accuracy is required use h5.

●Bearing Internal Clearance
A-29
5.1 Bearing internal clearance
Bearing internal clearance (initial clearance) is the
amount of internal clearance a bearing has before being
installed on a shaft or in a housing.
As shown in Fig. 5.1, when either the inner ring or the
outer ring is fixed and the other ring is free to move,
displacement can take place in either an axial or radial
direction. This amount of displacement (radially or axially)
is termed the internal clearance and, depending on the
direction, is called the radial internal clearance or the
axial internal clearance.
When the internal clearance of a bearing is measured, a
slight measurement load is applied to the raceway so the
internal clearance may be measured accurately.
However, at this time, a slight amount of elastic
deformation of the bearing occurs under the measurement
load, and the clearance measurement value (measured
clearance) is slightly larger than the true clearance. This
discrepancy between the true bearing clearance and the
increased amount due to the elastic deformation must be
compensated for. These compensation values are given in
Table 5.1. For roller bearings the amount of elastic
deformation can be ignored.
The internal clearance values for each bearing class are
shown in Tables 5.2 through 5.9.

With heavy or shock
load, clearance is great.
Shaft or inner ring is
heated.
To reduce shaft runout,
clearance is adjusted.
With direction

5.2 Internal clearance selection
The internal clearance of a bearing under operating
conditions (effective clearance) is usually smaller than
the same bearing's initial clearance before being installed
and operated.  This is due to several factors including
bearing fit, the difference in temperature between the
inner and outer rings, etc.  As a bearing's operating
clearance has an effect on bearing life, heat generation,
vibration, noise, etc.; care must be taken in selecting the
most suitable operating clearance.
Effective internal clearance:
The internal clearance differential between the initial
clearance and the operating (effective) clearance (the
amount of clearance reduction caused by interference
fits, or clearance variation due to the temperature
difference between the inner and outer rings) can be
calculated by the following formula:
δeff ＝δo －（δf ＋δt ）…………………（5.1）
where,
δeff : Effective internal clearance, mm
δo  : Bearing internal clearance, mm
δf   : Reduced amount of clearance due to
interference, mm
δt  : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
temperature differential of inner and outer 
r, mm

(1) Reduced clearance due to interference
When bearings are installed with interference fits on
shafts and in housings, the inner ring will expand and the
outer ring will contract; thus reducing the bearings'
internal clearance. The amount of expansion or
contraction varies depending on the shape of the
bearing, the shape of the shaft or housing, dimensions of
the respective parts, and the type of materials used. The
differential can range from approximately 70% to 90% of
the effective interference.
δf ＝(0.70～0.90) ∆deff  …………………… (5.2)
where,
δf  : Reduced amount of clearance due to
interference, mm
∆deff : Effective interference, mm
(2) Reduced internal clearance due to inner/outer ring
temperature difference.
During operation, normally the outer ring will range
from 5 to 10℃cooler than the inner ring or rotating parts.
However, if the cooling effect of the housing is large, the
shaft is connected to a heat source, or a heated
substance is conducted through the hollow shaft; the
temperature difference between the two rings can be
even greater. The amount of internal clearance is thus
further reduced by the differential expansion of the two
rings.
δt ＝α・∆T・Do ………………………… (5.3)
where,
δt : Amount of reduced clearance due to heat
differential, mm
α : Bearing steel linear expansion coefficient
12.5 × 10-6/˚C
∆T : Inner/outer ring temperature differential, ℃
Do  : Outer ring raceway diameter, mm
Outer ring raceway diameter, Do, values can be
approximated by using formula (5.4) or (5.5).
For ball bearings and self-aligning roller bearings,
Do ＝0.20 (d ＋4.0D) ……………………… (5.4)
For roller bearings (except self-aligning),
Do ＝0.25 (d ＋3.0D) ……………………… (5.5)
where,
d : Bearing bore diameter, mm
D : Bearing outside diameter, mm

●Lubrication
6. Lubrication
6.1  Lubrication of rolling bearings 
The purpose of bearing lubrication is to prevent direct
metallic contact between the various rolling and sliding
elements. This is accomplished through the formation of a
thin oil (or grease) film on the contact surfaces.  For
rolling bearings, lubrication also has the following
advantages:
(1) Friction and wear reduction
(2) Friction heat dissipation
(3) Prolonged bearing life
(4) Prevention of rust
(5) Protection against harmful elements
In order to achieve the above effects, the most effective
lubrication method for the operating conditions must be
selected. Also, a good quality, reliable lubricant must be
selected. In addition, an effectively designed sealing
system that prevents the intrusion of damaging elements

(dust, water, etc.) into the bearing interior, removes dust
and other impurities from the lubricant, and prevents the
lubricant from leaking to the outside, is also a
requirement.
Almost all rolling bearings use either grease or oil
lubrication methods, but in some special applications, a
solid lubricant such as molybdenum disulfide or graphite
may be used.
Fig. 6.1 shows the relationship between oil volume,
friction loss, and bearing temperature.  Table 6.1 details
the characteristics of this relationship.
6.2 Characteristics of grease and oil lubricants 
Grease and oil are the two general choices for
lubrication: it is important to select lubricant with care.
Please contact NTN Engineering when selecting a
lubricant.
The characteristics are show in table 6.2.
Table 6.1  Oil volume, friction loss, bearing temperature 
(See Fig. 6.1)
Range
Characteristics
Lubrication method
When oil volume is extremely low,
direct metallic contact occurs in places
between the rolling elements and
raceway surfaces. Bearing abrasion
and seizing occur.
A thin oil film develops over all
surfaces, friction is minimal and
bearing temperature is low.
As oil volume increases, heat buildup
is balanced by cooling.
Regardless of oil volume, temperature
increases at a fixed rate.
As oil volume increases, cooling
predominates and bearing temperature
decreases.

lubrication characteristics
6.3  Grease lubrication
Grease type lubricants are relatively easy to handle and
require only the simplest sealing devices–for these
reasons, grease is the most widely used lubricant for
rolling bearings.
6.3.1  Types and characteristics of grease
Lubricating greases are composed of either a mineral
oil base or a synthetic oil base. To this base a thickener
and other additives are added. The properties of all
greases are mainly determined by the kind of base oil
used and by the combination of thickening agent and
various additives.
Standard greases and their characteristics are listed in
Table 6.3. As performance characteristics of even the
same type of grease will vary widely from brand to brand,
it is best to check the manufacturers' data when selecting
a grease.

●Lubrication
6.3.6  Mixing of greases
When greases of different kinds are mixed together, the
consistency of the greases will change (usually softer), the
operating temperature range will be lowered, and other
changes in characteristics will occur. As a general rule,
greases with different bases oil, and greases with different
thickener agents should never be mixed.
Also, greases of different brands should not be mixed
because of the different additives they contain.
However, if different greases must be mixed, at least
greases with the same base oil and thickening agent
should be selected. But even when greases of the same
base oil and thickening agent are mixed, the quality of the
grease may still change due to the difference in additives.
For this reason, changes in consistency and other qualities
should be checked before being applied.
6.3.7  Amount of grease
The amount of grease used in any given situation will
depend on many factors relating to the size and shape of
the housing, space limitations, bearing's rotating speed
and type of grease used.
As a general rule, housings and bearings should be
only filled from 30% to 60% of their capacities.

6.3.2  Base oil
Natural mineral oil or synthetic oils such as diester oil,
silicone oil and fluorocarbon oil are used as grease base
oils.
Mainly, the properties of any grease are determined by
the properties of the base oil. Generally, greases with a
low viscosity base oil are best suited for low temperatures
and high speeds; while greases made from high viscosity
base oils are best suited for heavy loads.
6.3.3  Thickening agents
Thickening agents are compounded with base oils to
maintain the semi-solid state of the grease.  Thickening
agents consist of two types of bases, metallic soaps and
non-soaps.  Metallic soap thickeners include: lithium,
sodium, calcium, etc.
Non-soap base thickeners are divided into two groups;
inorganic (silica gel, bentonite, etc.) and organic (poly-
urea, fluorocarbon, etc.).
The various special characteristics of a grease, such as
limiting temperature range, mechanical stability, water
resistance, etc. depend largely on the type of thickening
agent used. For example, a sodium based grease is
generally poor in water resistance properties, while
greases with bentone, poly-urea and other non-metallic
soaps as the thickening agent are generally superior in
high temperature properties.
6.3.4  Additives
Various additives are added to greases to improve
various properties and efficiency. For example, there are
anti-oxidants, high-pressure additives (EP additives), rust
preventives, and anti-corrosives.
For bearings subject to heavy loads and/or shock loads,
a grease containing high-pressure additives should be
used. For comparatively high operating temperatures or
in applications where the grease cannot be replenished
for long periods, a grease with an oxidation stabilizer is
best to use.
6.3.5  Consistency
The consistency of a grease, i.e. the stiffness and
liquidity, is expressed by a numerical index.
The NLGI values for this index indicate the relative
softness of the grease; the larger the number, the stiffer
the grease.  The consistency of a grease is determined
by the amount of thickening agent used and the viscosity
of the base oil. For the lubrication of rolling bearings,
greases with the NLGI consistency numbers of 1, 2, and
3 are used.
General relationships between consistency and
application of grease are shown in Table 6.4.

A-41
●Lubrication
Where speeds are high and temperature rises need to
be kept to a minimum, a reduced amount of grease
should be used. Excessive amount of grease cause
temperature rise which in turn causes the grease to
soften and may allow leakage. With excessive grease fills
oxidation and deterioration may cause lubricating
efficiency to be lowered.
6.4 Solid grease (for bearings with solid grease)
"Solid grease" is a lubricant composed mainly of
lubricating grease and ultra-high polymer polyethylene.
Solid grease has the same viscosity as grease at normal
temperature, but by applying a special heat treatment
process, this special grease solidifies retaining a large
proportion of the lubricant within the bearing. The result of
this solidification is that the grease does not easily leak
from the bearing, even when the bearing is subjected to
strong vibrations or centrifugal force. 
Bearings with solid grease are available in two types:
the spot-pack type in which solid grease is injected into
the retainer, and the full-pack type in which all empty
space around the rolling elements is filled with solid
grease. 
Spot-pack solid grease is standard for deep groove ball
bearings, small diameter ball bearings, and bearing units.
Full-pack solid grease is standard for self-aligning ball
bearings, self-aligning roller bearings, and needle roller
bearings. 
Primary advantages:
(1) Clean working environment with minimal grease
leakage
(2) Low bearing torque with spot-pack type solid grease
For more details, please refer to the NTN special catalog
for Solid grease bearings.

6.5 Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication is suitable for applications that require
bearing-generated heat or heat applied to the bearing
from other sources be carried away from the bearing and
A-42
Lubrication method
Example
¡In this method, the 
required minimum 
amount of lubricating oil 
is measured and fed to 
each bearing at ideal 
intervals using 
compressed air. 
¡With fresh lubricating oil 
constantly being fed to 
the bearing, and with 
the cooling effect of the 
compressed air, bearing 
temperature rise can be 
minimized. 
¡Because the required oil 
quantity is infinitesimal, 
the working environment 
can be kept clean.
　Air-oil lubrication units 
are available from NTN.
Lubrication method
Example
(Air-oil lubrication)
¡This method lubricates 
by injecting oil under 
high pressure directly 
into the side of the 
bearing. This is a 
reliable system for high 
speed, high temperature 
or otherwise severe 
conditions.
¡Used for lubricating the 
bearings in jet engines, 
gas turbines, and other 
high speed equipment. 
¡Under-race lubrication 
for machine tools is one 
example of this type of 
lubrication.
(Oil jet lubrication)
¡Using pressurized air, 
lubricating oil is 
atomized before passing 
through the bearing. 
¡Due to the low lubricant 
resistance, this method 
is well suited to high 
speed applications.
 (Oil mist lubrication)
¡In this method, a 
partially submerged disc 
rotates and pulls oil up 
into a reservoir from 
which it then drains 
down through the 
bearing, lubricating it.
 (Disc lubrication)
¡In this method, oil is 
collected above the 
bearing and allowed to 
drip down into the 
housing where it 
becomes a lubricating 
mist as it strikes the 
rolling elements. 
Another version allows 
only slight amounts of 
oil to pass through the 
bearing. 
¡Used at relatively high 
speeds for light to 
moderate load 
applications. 
¡In most cases, oil 
volume is a few drops 
per minute.
(Drip lubrication)
¡Used for bearing cooling 
applications or for 
automatic oil supply 
systems in which the oil 
supply is centrally 
located. 
¡One of the advantages 
of this method is that oil 
cooling devices and 
filters to maintain oil 
purity can be installed 
within the system. 
¡In order for oil to 
thoroughly lubricate the 
bearing, oil inlets and 
outlets must be provided 
on opposite sides of the 
bearing.
 (Circulating lubrication)
¡In this method, an 
impeller or similar 
device mounted on the 
shaft draws up oil and 
sprays it onto the 
bearing. This method 
can be used at 
considerably high 
speeds.
(Oil spray lubrication)
¡Oil bath lubrication is 
the most generally used 
method of lubrication 
and is widely used for 
low to moderate rotation 
speed applications.
¡For horizontal shaft 
applications, oil level 
should be maintained at 
approximately the 
center of the lowest 
rolling element, 
according to the oil 
gauge, when the 
bearing is at rest. For 
vertical shafts at low 
speeds, oil level should 
be maintained at 50 - 
80% submergence of 
the rolling elements.

●Lubrication
6.5.1 Selection of lubricating oil
Under normal operating conditions, spindle oil, machine
oil, turbine oil, and other mineral oils are widely used for
the lubrication of rolling bearings. However, for
temperatures above 150˚C or below -30˚C, synthetic oils
such as diester oil, silicone oil, and fluorocarbon oil are
used.
For lubricating oils, viscosity is one of the most
important properties and it determines an oil’s lubricating
efficiency. If viscosity is too low, formation of the oil film
will be insufficient, and damage will occur to the load
carrying surfaces of the bearing. If viscosity is too high,
viscous resistance will also be great and result in
temperature increases and friction loss. In general, for
higher speed applications a lower viscosity oil should be
used; for heavier load applications, a higher viscosity oil
should be used. 
In regard to operating temperature and lubrication,
Table 6.7 lists the required oil viscosity for different types
of rolling bearings. Fig. 6.3 is an oil viscosity–operating
temperature comparison chart for the purpose of
selecting a lubrication oil with viscosity characteristics
appropriate to an application. 
Table 6.8 lists the selection standards for lubricating oil
viscosity with reference to bearing operating conditions.
6.5.2 Oil quantity
In forced oil lubrication systems, the heat radiated away
by the housing and surrounding parts plus the heat
carried away by the lubricating oil is approximately equal
to the amount of heat generated by the bearing and other
sources. 
For standard housing applications, the quantity of oil
required can be found by formula (6.2).
Q＝K・q ……………………………… (6.2)
where, 
Q: Quantity of oil for one bearing cm3/min.
K: Allowable oil temperature rise factor (Table 6.9)
q: Minimum oil quantity cm3/min. (Fig. 6.4)
Because the amount of heat radiated will vary
according to the type of housing, for actual operation it is
advisable that the quantity of oil calculated by formula
(6.2) be multiplied by a factor or 1.5 or 2.0. Then, the
amount of oil can be adjusted to correspond to actual
operating conditions.

6.5.3 Relubrication intervals
The intervals at which lubricating oil should be changed
varies depending upon operating conditions, oil quantity,
and type of oil used. In general, for oil bath lubrication
where the operating temperature is 50˚C or less, oil
should be replaced once a year. When the operating
temperature is between 80˚C – 100˚C, oil should be
replaced at least every three months. For important
equipment, it is advisable that lubricating efficiency and
oil purity deterioration be checked regularly to determine
when oil replacement is necessary. 
Furthermore, if it is assumed for calculation purposes
that no heat is radiated by the housing, and that all
bearing heat is removed by the oil, then the value in Fig.
6.3 for shaft diameter, d ＝0, regardless of actual shaft
diameter.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
(Example) For tapered roller bearing 30220U
mounted on a flywheel shaft with a radial load of 9.5
kN (969 kgf), operating at 1,800 min-1, what is the
amount of lubricating oil required to keep the bearing
temperature rise below 15˚C.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
d ＝100 mm，
dn ＝100×1,800＝18×104
From Fig. 6.4
q ＝180cm3 / min
Assume the bearing temperature is approximately
equal to the expelled oil temperature,
from Table 6.9, since K ＝1
Q＝1×180＝180cm3 / min

7.1 Raceway and rolling element materials
While the contact surfaces of a bearing's raceways and
rolling elements are subjected to repeated heavy stress,
they still must maintain high precision and rotational
accuracy. To accomplish this, the raceways and rolling
elements must be made of a material that has high
hardness, is resistant to rolling fatigue, is wear resistant,
and has good dimensional stability. The most common
cause of fatigue cracking in bearings is the inclusion of
non-metallic impurities in the steel. By using pure materials
low in these non-metallic impurities, the rolling fatigue life of
the bearing is lengthened. 
For all NTN bearings, steel low in oxygen content and
non-metallic impurities, then refined by a vacuum
degassing process as well as outside hearth smelting, is
used. For bearings requiring especially high reliability and
long life, steels of even higher in purity, such as vacuum
smelted steel (VIM, VAR, CEVM) and electro-slag melted
steel (ESR), are used.
1) High/mid carbon alloy steel
In general, steel varieties which can be hardened not just
on the surface but also deep hardened by the so-called
"through hardening method" are used for the raceways and
rolling elements of bearings. Foremost among these is high
carbon chromium bearing steel, which is widely used. For
large type bearings and bearings with large cross sectional
dimensions, induction hardened bearing steel incorporating
manganese or molybdenum is used. Also in use is mid-
carbon chromium steel incorporating silicone and
manganese, which gives it hardening properties
comparable to high carbon chromium steel.
2) Case hardened (carburized) steel
Because of its combination of a hard surface layer which
has been carburized and hardened to an appropriate
depth, and a relatively pliable inner core, case hardened
steel has excellent efficiency against shock loads. NTN
uses case hardened steel for almost all of its tapered roller
bearings. In terms of case hardened steel for NTN's other
bearings, chromium steel and chrome molybdenum steel
are used for small to medium sized bearings, and nickel
chrome molybdenum steel is used for large sized bearings. 
3) Heat resistant bearing steel
When bearings made of ordinary high carbon chromium
steel which have undergone standard heat treatment are
used at temperatures above 120˚C for long durations,
unacceptably large dimensional changes can occur. For
this reason, a dimension stabilizing treatment (TS
treatment) has been devised for very high temperature
applications. Through application of this dimension
stabilizing treatment, shortening of rolling fatigue life due to
decreases in bearing hardness at high temperatures can
be avoided. (refer to page insert A-6 1.3.2)
For standard high temperature bearings used at
temperatures from 150˚C – 200˚C, the addition of silicone
to the steel improves heat resistance and results in a
A-45
●Bearing Materials
7.  Bearing Materials
bearing with excellent rolling fatigue life with minimal
dimensional change or softening at high temperatures. 
A variety of heat resistant steels are also incorporated in
bearings to minimize softening and dimensional changes
when used at high temperatures. Two of these are high
speed molybdenum steel and high speed tungsten steel.
For bearings requiring heat resistance in high speed
applications, there is also heat resistant case hardening
molybdenum steel. 
4) Corrosion resistant bearing steel
For applications requiring high corrosion resistance,
stainless steel is used. To achieve this corrosion resistance
a large proportion of the alloying element chrome is added
to martensite stainless steel. 
5) Induction hardened steel
Besides the use of surface hardening steel, induction
hardening is also utilized for bearing raceway surfaces, and
for this purpose mid-carbon steel is used for its lower
carbon content instead of through hardened steel. For
induction hardening of the deep layers required for larger
bearings and bearings with large surface dimensions, mid-
carbon steel is fortified with chrome and molybdenum.
6) Other bearing materials
For ultra high speed applications and applications
requiring very high level corrosion resistance, ceramic
bearing materials such as Si3N4 are also available. 
7.2 Cage materials
Bearing cage materials must have the strength to
withstand rotational vibrations and shock loads. These
materials must also have a low friction coefficient, be light
weight, and be able to withstand bearing operation
temperatures. 
For small and medium sized bearings, pressed cages of
cold or hot rolled steel with a low carbon content of approx.
0.1% are used. However, depending on the application,
austenitic stainless steel is also used. 
For large bearings, machined cages of machine
structural carbon steel or high tensile cast brass are widely
used, although aluminum alloy and other material cages
are also available. 
For aircraft engine bearings, high tensile brass, mid-
carbon nickel, chrome, or molybdenum steel is used after
undergoing various heat treatments and high temperature
tempering. The sliding properties of these materials may
also be enhanced when silver plated. 
Injection molded plastic cages are now widely used: most
are made from fiberglass reinforced heat resistant
polyamide resin. Plastic cages are light weight, corrosion
resistant and have excellent damping and sliding
properties. Heat resistant polyamide resins now enable the
production of cages that perform well in applications
ranging between -40˚C – 120˚C. However, they are not
recommended for use at temperatures exceeding 120˚C.

●Deep Groove Ball Bearings
1. Structure and Characteristics
A widely used bearing, the deep groove ball bearing takes
its name from the track formed on both the inner and outer
rings of the bearing. The bearings can sustain radial and
axial loads and the resultant forces of these loads and they
are suitable for high speed operation.
The dimensional table below represents the various cage
models and special shapes. Drawing A is the pressed cage;
B-5
drawing B shows the machined cage; drawings C through
F show the position and shape of the notch on the inner ring;
and drawing G shows a bearing with the key groove on the
inner ring. Pressed cages are generally used, though
machined cages are used for larger sized bearings, or
bearings for high speed rotation.

6. General Operating Cautions
Slippage between the balls and raceways may occur
when bearings are operated under small loads (about Fr ≦
0.01Cor) and may cause smearing. This is most apparent
when using large size deep groove ball bearings due to the
large cage mass. Please consult NTN Engineering for further
details.

Angular Contact Ball Bearings

●Angular Contact Ball Bearings
1. Structure and Characteristics
1. 1  Single row angular contact ball bearings /
duplex angular contact ball bearings
A line connecting the contact points of both the ball and
inner ring and ball and outer ring  forms an angle to a line
drawn radially: that angle is called the contact angle.
An angular contact ball bearing, while designed for radial
loads, can accommodate single direction axial loads. Under
radial loads and the resulting axial force component, the
bearings are generally used in a duplex arrangement. More
information on types and characteristics of duplexed angular
B-15
Table 1 Duplex angular contact ball bearings
Arrangement type
Characteristics
¡Since the distance "l" between the cone pressure apexes of bearing is large, 
　the load capacity of the moment load is high.
¡Permissible slant angle is small.
These bearings support 
the radial loads and both
direction of axial loads.
Back-to-back
duplex arrangement
(Code: DB)
Face-to-face
duplex arrangement
(Code: DF)
Notes: 1. Since the bearings are manufactured in a set to adjust for the internal clearance or pre-loading, parts with same serial number must be 
　　　　used for assembly.
            2. Combination of more than 3 bearings may occur.  Please consult NTN Engineering for details.

¡The distance "l" between the cone pressure apexes of bearing is small in 
　comparison with the back-to-back duplex arrangement, the load capacity of 
　the moment load is low.
¡Permissible slant angle is larger than the back-to-back duplex arrangement type.
contact ball bearings is shown in Table 1.
Cage types and special features of single and multi–row
angular contact ball bearings are show in Fig.1. Drawings A
through F feature the inner ring guide cage. Drawings B
and C illustrate cages with lubrication ports. Drawings D
and E feature a rolling element guide cage: E also shows
the cage with a lubrication port. Note that the inner ring
width in drawing F is larger than that of the outer ring.

5. Cautions for Operation
When the bearing loads are small(about Fr ≦0.02Cor) or
the ratio between the axial and radial loads of the duplex
bearing exceeds the value "e", slippage may occur between
the balls and the raceways. This slippage may cause
smearing. Particularly with large size angular contact ball
bearings, this tendency is significant since the ball and cage
mass is large.  Please consult with NTN Engineering for
further details.

Fig.2  Double row angular contact ball bearings drawing
1. 2  Double row angular contact ball bearings
Two single row angular contact ball bearings when
duplexed back-to-back (DB) so that the inner ring forms one
piece are used to create double row angular contact ball
bearings. Alternatively, the bearings may be duplexed face-
to-face (DF) with the outer ring as one piece.
These bearings support radial and axial loads in either
direction: back-to-back duplexed bearings also support
moment loads.
The cage type and special shape of the double row
angular contact ball bearings are shown in Fig.2 with the list
of drawing numbers in the dimensions table. 
The drawings A and B are the front-to-front duplex
arrangement; drawing 2 is a bearing with a lubricating port;
drawings from C to G show the back-to-back duplex
arrangement and the different position of the lubricating
ports whether or not there are lubricating grooves. Drawing
C shows the inner ring width larger than that of outer ring.

●Cylindrical Roller Bearings
1. Structure and Characteristics
Since the rollers of the cylindrical roller bearings make line
contact with the raceways, these bearings can support heavy
radial loads and are suitable for high speed operation.
Assembly and disassembly are comparatively easy even if
the inner or outer ring requires a shrink fit, as the bearing is a
separation type.
B-37
Model code
Drawing
Characteristics
¡Model NU has ribs on the outer ring and the inner ring can be separated from  "the 　　
arranged set of outer ring, rollers and cage". Model N has ribs on the inner ring and the 
outer ring can be separated from "the arranged set of inner ring, rollers and cage".
¡This bearing cannot support axial loads.
¡The most suitable model widely used as the free end bearing.
¡Model NJ has ribs on the outer ring and a rib on the inner ring. 
   Model NF has a rib on the outer ring and ribs on the inner ring.
¡These bearings support axial loads in one direction only.
¡There may be a case to use two bearings adjacent when they are used regardless of the 
fixed end or free end.
¡Model NUP has a rib ring added on the side of the inner ring where it did not have a rib. 
Model NJ with the added ring rib of Model L is Model NH.  The inner ring should be fixed 
along the axial direction since each ring rib will be separated.
¡These bearings support axial loads in either direction.
¡There may be a case to use as the fixed end bearing.

Characteristics
¡These bearings are used in the main shaft of machine tools, rolling mill rolls and printing 
machine plate cylinders where thin walled bearings are needed.
¡To use the bearing in the main shaft of machine tools, adjust the radial internal clearance 
by inserting a tapered inner ring to the tapered shaft.

Table 2  Model and characteristics of the double row cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings are classified as single row,
double row and four row type, according to how many rollers
are used, and there are models as shown in Table 1 to 3. 
Although designed as a thin wall type, the SL Model
double row cylindrical roller bearing can support enormous
radial and impact loads. Table 4 lists the configurations
available.  
Note: Model E provides higher load capacity designed with increased diameter,length and numbers of rollers but the boundary dimensions are same as the
standard type bearings.

Drawing
Characteristics
Refer to the drawings.
Drawing numbers are
listed in the dimensions table.
¡ The bearing is mainly used for the roll neck of a rolling mill, and is designed so as to handle the maximum rating load 
for the allowable space in the roll neck part. Carbonized steel may be used to provide better resistance to cracking or 
impact to the inner ring.
¡ Consult NTN Engineering about the fitting and bearing internal clearance when the bearing is used for the preparing 
roll of a rolling mill.
¡ NTN provides bearings with special configurations: with tapered shaft holes; for high speed use; designed to prevent 
creeping; and, with dust and waterproof seals.

Characteristics
Model SL01
Model SL02
¡Fixed end is Model SL01, free end is Model SL02.
¡Since the outer ring is split in the circumference direction using a special method and fixed as a unit 
after mounting rollers, the bearing side face should be securely fixed using the shaft or 
housing shoulder in the axial direction.
¡Outer ring has an oil groove and port.
¡Model SL01 can support axial loads from both directions via rollers.
¡Shoulder dimensions of shaft and bearings generally applies Da and da dimensions in the dimensions 
table, but J and K dimensions are used when the moment or large axial loads are applied.
¡Model SL04 only with the fixed side.
¡Since the inner ring is split in the circumference direction using a special method and fixed as a unit 
after mounting rollers, the bearing side face should be securely fixed by using the shaft or housing 
shoulder in the axial direction.
¡Inner ring has an oil groove and port.
¡Model SL04 can support radial and axial loads in either directions.
¡A sealed bearing prelubricated with grease, the outer ring is fitted with a locating snap ring, making it 
easy to handle and appropriate for sheaves and other applications.
¡Surface coating is added for rust prevention.
Model SL04
Note: We also provide 3-row, 4-row and 5-row bearings for the Model SL cylindrical roller bearing. Consult NTN Engineering for further details.

2. Dimensional Accuracy/Rotation Accuracy
Refer to Table 3.3 (Page A-12,13)
3.  Recommended Fitting
Refer to Table 4.2 (Page A-24)
4.  Bearing Internal Clearance
Refer to Table 5.5 and 5.6 (Page A-31, 32, 33)
5.  Permissible slant angle
It varies according to the bearing type and internal
specifications, the values in the table below are widely
used to avoid edge loads under general load conditions.
When the width series is 0 or 1 ⋯⋯0.001 rad (3.5')
When the width series is 2 ⋯⋯⋯⋯0.0005 rad (1.5')
Double row cylindrical roller bearing 1 ⋯0.0005 rad (1.5')
1 This is no applied to high accuracy bearings which are
used as the main shaft of machine tools.
6.  Radial internal clearance of the Model
SL cylindrical roller bearings.  
Table 6 lists the radial internal clearance values of the
Model SL cylindrical roller bearings.
7.  Recommended fit of the Model SL
cylindrical roller bearings, and selection
of the radial internal clearance.
Table 7 lists the recommended fit for outer ring rotation
such as sheaves and wheels, Table 8 lists the relation
between the fitting and the radial internal clearance.
For assembling and disassembling the bearing, it is
necessary to evenly load around the circumference of the
raceway end on the fitting side.
8.  General Operating Cautions
Slippage between the rollers and raceways may occur
when bearings are operated under small loads (about Fr ≦
0.04Cor) and may cause smearing. This is most apparent
when using large size cylindrical roller bearings due to the
large cage mass. Please consult NTN Engineering for further
details.

Tapered  Roller bearings

●Tapered Roller Bearings
1. Type, Structure and Characteristics
Tapered roller bearings are designed such that their
conical rollers and raceways are arranged so that all
elements of the roller and race way cones meet at a common
apex on the bearing axis. (Refer to Fig.1)  The rolling
elements perform the real rotating movement on the
raceway; the synthesized force from the inner and outer ring
raceways guides the rollers, pressing them to the large rib on
the inner ring. Metric and inch series are considered
standard and both systems are widely used.

The inner ring, rollers and cage can be separated as a
unit, or the CONE,  from the outer ring, or the CUP. The cup
and cone are called sub-units. Sub-unit dimensions for the
nominal cup small inside diameter and bearing contact
angle, as shown in Fig. 2, are standardized by ISO and
ABMA and are compatible between sub-units. Double row
and four row bearings are available in addition to single row
bearings. Models and characteristics are shown in Tables 1
and 2.

Characteristics
¡These bearings are designed with one double row outer ring and two pairs of inner rings with rollers. Bearings 
are adjusted so that their internal clearance becomes the specified value, the parts which have the same serial 
numbers should be assembled according to the assembly codes.
¡These bearings support radial and axial loads. Since the cone pressure apex is wide, bearings are suitable 
where moment loads are applied.
¡These bearings have the same function as  the back-to-back duplex arrangement of single row bearings.
¡This bearing model has a larger and steeper contact angle than the double row with vertex of contact angles 
outside the bearing. These bearings are used when the axial load is large.
¡Since these bearings are adjusted so that the internal clearance is a specified value (like the double row with 
vertex of contact angles outside of bearing) the parts which have the same serial numbers should be 
assembled according to the assembly codes.
¡ These bearings are designed with one double row inner ring with rollers and two pairs of outer rings and an 
outer ring spacer. 
¡ These bearings accept the radial and axial loads. Since the cone pressure apex is short, bearings are not 
suitable when the moment is applied.
¡Since these bearings are adjusted so that the internal clearance is the specified value (like the double row with 
vertex of contact angles outside of bearing) the parts which have the same serial numbers should be 
assembled according to the assembly codes.
¡ This bearing model has a larger and steeper contact angle than the double row with vertex of contact angles 
inside the bearing. These bearings are used  when the axial load is large or only axials are applied.
¡ Models without an outer ring spacer and with a key groove or notch on the inner ring (refer to the drawing) are 
also available. Consult NTN Engineering about this bearing's fit.
¡ These bearings may be pressurized by using a spring between the housing shoulder and outer ring end.

5. General Operating Cautions
Slippage between the balls and raceways may occur
when bearings are operated under small loads, or when the
ratio between axial and radial loads of the duplexed
bearings exceeds the value “e,” and may cause smearing.
This is most apparent when using large size tapered roller
bearings due to the large cage mass. Please consult NTN
Engineering for further details.

Characteristics
¡These bearings are designed with two double row inner rings with rollers, one double row outer 
ring, two single outer ring and outer ring spacer/inner ring spacer. Bearings are adjusted so that  
their internal clearance becomes the specified value, the parts which have the same serial numbers 
should be assembled according to the assembly codes.
¡The bearing is mainly used for the roll neck of rolling mill, and designed so as to become the 
maximum rating load for the allowable space in the roll neck part. 
¡The bearing uses the clearance-fit to make assemble and disassembley easier.  For this purpose, 
bearings are designed with a helical groove on the inner ring bore to prevent wearing of the inner 
ring bore when creep occurs and uses the carbonized steel to prevent cracks on inner ring and 
improve the shock resistance.
¡Please consult with NTN Engineering for fitting and bearing internal clearance.
¡Bearings are designed with oil seals on both side of the bearing which is the same as the four row 
tapered roller bearings.
¡Please consult with NTN Engineering for fitting and bearing internal clearance.

Spherical  Roller bearings

---

●Spherical Roller Bearings
1. Type, Structure and Characteristics
The barrel shaped spherical rolling elements of a self-
aligning bearing track along two rows of raceway grooves in
the inner ring. The center of the outer ring’s raceway aligns
with the center of the bearing. The self-aligning feature
accommodates errors in housing assembly and
misalignments between the inner and outer rings caused by
bent shafts. The bearings have a large load capacity and are
suitable for applications with vibration and impact loads.

Table 1  Model of Self-Aligning Roller Bearings
In addition to a cylindrical shaft bore, the bearings are
available with a tapered shaft bore. The tapered bore
bearings can be shaft mounted using an adapter or
removable sleeves. Table 1 shows the types of the self-
aligning roller bearings.  Please consult with NTN
Engineering for the special product (do part number starts
with 2p)
1.2 Lubrication holes and grooves
Holes and grooves to supply lubricant are provided on
self-aligning roller bearings with outside diameters greater
than 320mm. If required, lubrication holes and grooves can
be manufactured for bearings with ODs smaller than
320mm. Consult NTN Engineering for further details and
add the supplemental code D1 to the part number. Table 2
shows the dimensions for lubrication holes and grooves. The
number of lubrication holes are shown in Table 3.
When a knock pin for lubricant retention is necessary,
please contact NTN Engineering.

6. Assembly of Tapered Hole Roller Bearings
Tapered hole spherical roller bearings use the
measurement method as shown in Fig.1. A suitable
tightening rate can be achieved by pushing the bearing
toward the axial direction until it reaches the reduction rate
of the radial internal clearance or pushing rate of axial
direction.  When heavy and high speed loads are applied, or
when it is necessary to keep a higher tightening rate as the
temperature difference between the inner and outer rings
rises, be sure to have the maximum reduction rate of radial
internal clearance or the pushing rate of the axial direction,
as shown in Table 4, by using a bearing with a radial
internal clearance of more than C3. The clearance after
mounting in this case should be larger than the minimum
clearance after mounting as shown in Table 4.

●Spherical Roller Bearings
7. General Operating Cautions
Pressed cages or machined cages are standard
depending on the bearing type and dimensions. However, a
standard cage may not be used under high speed
specifications or in conditions under severe vibration or
impact.
When bearings are operated under small loads (about  Fr
≦0.04Cor), or under axial loads only, prevent rolling
elements from smearing by operating in conditions where
Fa/Fr ≦2e. (Refer to the dimension table for the value of
“e.”) This is most apparent when using large size spherical
roller bearings due to the large roller and cage mass. Please
consult NTN Engineering for further details.

●Thrust Bearings
1. Classification and Features
1. 1  Thrust ball bearings
Balls are arranged between a set of washers (a shaft
washer and housing washer) and the contact angle is 90°.
Axial loads can be supported in only one direction and radial
loads cannot be supported. These bearings are unsuitable
for high speed operation. Table 1 shows the standard cage
models.

(Example of the press cage)
Fig.2  Cylindrical roller thrust bearing
1. 2  Cylindrical roller thrust bearings
These bearings use cylindrical rollers and have single row,
double row, 3 row, 4 row, and also duplex types. Bearings
can support only axial loads and are suitable to heavy loads.
Their axial rigidity is high. Cages are the machined type.

●Thrust Bearings
B-228
1. 3  Tapered roller thrust bearings
These are thrust bearings using tapered rollers, and the
single type bearings have three types of housing washers.
One type is the housing raceway with a rib, the other one is
without a rib, and the third bearing is the full complement
roller type. Double type bearings are mainly used to support
axial loads on the roll neck of rolling mill. Machined cages
are used for cages.
1. 4  Self-aligning thrust roller bearings
These bearings have a self-aligning nature using barrel-
shaped rollers. The allowable aligning angle varies
depending on the bearing's dimension system, but it is 1°-
2°for normal loads. Cages are machined type and the guide
sleeve is on the axial housing raceway. Since the load
capacity for axial loads is high, these bearings can support a
certain amount of radial load in the instances that axial loads
are applied. However, it is necessary to use these bearing
where the load conditions meet Fr/Fa ≦0.55. 
These bearings have some spots where lubricant
cannot enter such as the gap between the cage and
guide sleeve. It is necessary to use oil lubrication even
in low speed operation.

4. General Operating Cautions
Thrust bearings need to load a certain amount of axial load
to prevent sliping between the rolling elements and axial
housing raceway.  Please consult with NTN Engineering for
details.

Remarks: Bearing numbers marked
"＊" signify bearings where the bearing shaft washer outer diameter is smaller than the housing shaft washer outer diameter. Therefore when using these bearings, it is possible to use the housing bore as is, without providing a ground undercut
on the outer diameter section of the bearing shaft washer as shown in the drawing.

¡ Since the inner ring, outer ring and
cage are split in two parts, it is possible
to mount the bearing in places where a
united bearing is difficult or impossible
to mount. (ie. Places where mounting
from the shaft end is impossible, an
obstacle exists on the shaft, or the shaft
is very long.)
¡ Inspection and maintenance after
mounting is easy.
1 The marked "＊" bearings has a spherical surface of outer rings outside dia. 
Remarks: 1. The above drawings are typical examples. Please contact NTN Engineering.

¡ These bearings are designed to be a full complement roller type and have high rating load for heavy loads, ultra low speed rotation
and space-saving.
¡ These bearings provide a multi-seal with a labyrinth ring, seal ring and special rubber seal to prevent water from invading.
¡ The clamping ring of the inner ring is not needed anymore and the structure of direct clamping is applied to make a compact bearing.
¡ Bearings have a self-aligning nature due to the roll deflection since the outer ring outside diameter and the housing inner diameter
are spherical.
¡ Application of a water cooling jacket type housing controls rising bearing temperatures.

¡ Since bearings are directly used in preparing rolls, the thickness of the outer ring is designed to be thicker than regular bearings.
¡ Since high accuracy under heavy loads is required, these bearings are designed to have a capacity for heavy loads and high accuracy.
¡ Several bearings are assembled on one shaft for operation, and the mutual difference of assembled thickness (Dimension H) of
bearings on the same shaft is very minimal.
¡ When the outer ring outside surface is worn, it is possible to recycle it by grinding it to a certain level.

¡ This unit has established both low torque operation and tight sealing by a labyrinth structure and low-contact seals.
¡ When further low torque is requested, the roll unit (Model BUB), which uses only the deep groove ball bearings, is available.
¡ Since the unit is used as a backup roll, the accuracy and its surface roughness are designed to be low.

¡ These are compound type bearings which unite the double row thrust roller bearing and the radial roller bearing.
¡ These bearings are designed so that rollers in each row support axial and moment loads respectively, and high rigidity and
long life can be obtained since the rolling parts make line contact.
¡ They are suitable for tunnel excavating machines or cranes with frequent turns.

¡ Special contact type rubber seal prevents foreign matter from entering the bearings.
¡ Compact design enables bearings to be mounted with the standard type of plummer blocks (SN5, SN2).
¡ Greasing bearings is possible since lubrication grooves and holes are provided on the outer ring.
¡ Bearings are prelubricated with grease and can be directly mounted on machines.

¡ These are self-aligning sliding bearings: the sliding parts form a spherical surface. The bearings also can support radial loads and
axial loads in either direction.
¡ A lubricant (oil or grease) should be used since the sliding parts are steel on steel.
¡ These bearings are suitable for swinging and aligning movements, and used in joint-movement parts for industrial and construction machines.

1kgf＝9.80665N
1N＝0.101972kgf
If for example you want to convert 10 kgf to N, find "10" in the middle 
column of the first set of columns on the right. Look in the N column 
directly to the right of "10," and you will see that 10 kgf equals 98.066 
N. Oppositely, to convert 10 N to kgf, look in the kgf column to the 
right of "10" and you will see that 10 N equals 1.0197 kgf.
