SIDEFLEXING CHAINS 
with low noise accumulation rollers
These chains are produced in 
a silent version with reduced 
backline pressure.
Low Noise Rollers
Advantages:
High ultimate load
Rollers manufactured in
low 
friction and low noise
Characteristics:
This new series of thermoplastic chains
is the solution to the pressure created
between products and the conveying 
surface created by the accumulation of
products.
This is achieved by having a series of
small width rollers which provides a 
stable conveying surface and enables
the product to be handled without
damage, however the chain still provides a positive forward motion and is
based on our standard series LF 882
TAB chain.
SIDEFLEXING CHAINS with 
low noise accumulation rollers 
Series LBP 882 TAB
Applications:
Food and beverage industry packaging line (ex. pet bottle packs in
heat shrink film)
General purpose conveying 
applications to reduce pressure 
created between product and 
flight surface.
Standard length:
40 pitches (5 Ft - 1.524 m)

LBP 882 M SIDEFLEXING CHAINS FOR MAGNETIC SYSTEM - HEAVY 
DUTY SINGLE HINGE with low noise accumulation rollers
Advantages:
High ultimate load
Rollers manufactured in low 
friction and low noise material:
reduced pack-line pressure and
quiet running.
A pin roller support has been
added to maintain a flat and consistent carryng surface.
(10”- 12”width only).
On conveyor construction
Easy to clean
Easy maintenance
Pin material:
Ferritic Stainless Steel
Characteristics:
This new series of thermoplastic chains

Note:
Plastic magnetic system chains do not
have tabs or bevels, it is the Stainless
Steel pin in the chain which is attracted by the magnets embedded in the
curve.
