ROD ENDS AND 
SPHERICAL PLAIN BEARINGS 
FOR MOTOR SPORT


2
Introduction
The FLURO® production program consists of Rod Ends to DIN ISO 12240 - 4 and Spherical Plain Bearings to  DIN
ISO 12240 - 1, Series K and E. Stainless steel, maintenance free and versions with lubrication fittings are available.
Where bearings with standard dimensions cannot be used, parts to customer designs are manufactured.
Since many years the FLURO® products have achieved a reputation of high quality and durability. Therefore the
demand within the industrial application market continuously increased. Market observation and customer requests
initiated the development and design of a Motor Sport product.
Technical research and continuous product development enabled FLURO® to establish a product version exclusively
designed for motor sport applications. 
On the following pages Rod Ends and Spherical Plain Bearings are introduced, which have already proven itself in
Motor Sport applications.
Recently our industrial plant was enlarged and modernized. This means advanced improvements to our logistics
and an enlarged stock of products for faster production and delivery response.
For Rod Ends and Spherical Plain Bearings for the
industrial application sector, please refer to FLURO®'s
general catalogue which is available on request.

Characteristics of MS - Series:
Preloaded bearing fit
An internal play with 'zero' tolerance is achieved through a preloaded bearing. Under normal permissible conditions
and usage a minimal settlement of the bearing components or a minimal tolerance increase at the mating surface
will take place. This special bearing technology causes a considerably higher bearing life with continuous low 
internal clearance. However MS-Spherical Plain Bearings are not suited for rotation as well as very high swivel 
frequency.
Please note that the series GXO..ICR(RR) is not a preloaded bearing version, but the clearance is reduced to a 
minimal fit.
Surface
The nickel plated housing surface with a high polish finish achieves a sporty appealing design, especially on visible
components. This high-quality surface treatment with high corrosion resistance minimizes the sedimentation of dirt
and is easy to clean.
Lubrication
Maintenance Free Rod Ends and Spherical Plain Bearings must not be lubricated. The ball revolves on a PTFE liner
incorporated in the Insert.
The Motor Sport steel on steel version should be lubricated with the FLURO® high performance grease FE 3752.
This grease can be ordered from FLURO®.
Examination:
Upon customer requirements the parts can be checked against cracks.

The Motor Sport application has its own demand on product and technique. The required task is to create a 
product which combines high performance and an appealing sporty design. Animated through customers and in
close contact with technicians and university development teams FLURO® developed this MS series. For the below
mentioned applications the technical geometric design in connection with the performance of the bearing becomes
important. A special emphasis has to be laid on the bearing's composition of inner ring, insert, mating surface and
housing.
A classic application for Rod Ends is the suspension
system. Related to it are different load problems such
as vibrations and shocks under radial or axial loads.
This dynamic stress demands a technically high quality
bearing.
Depending on the race course and the driving performance of the driver, different loads can occur on the
steering system.
In addition racing vehicles require a sporty design and
appearance. The nickel plated housing with a high
polish finish offers a professional racing look and is
easy to clean from dirt and grease.
For motor cycles Rod Ends and Spherical Plain
Bearings are used as stabilizers, for rod linkages and
steering devices.

Torque:
Because the bearing has 'no play', the internal clearance (torque) of the MS parts can be only defined by
the force with which the ball can be moved.
Requirements:
The force (torque) with which the ball can be moved is
measured in Ndm (Newton per decimetre). Herewith a
bolt with one decimetre length is inserted into the 
ball's bore and the force to move the ball is measured
with a spring balance. To neutralise the slip stick
effect before measuring, the ball has to be moved at
least five times the maximum possible distance.
Because the 'breakaway torque' will be three times
higher than the real torque value. 
The torque rating on the rod ends data sheet in this
catalogue, is the load during operating process (after
a short period of warm-up time). 
The torque rating on the spherical plain bearings data
sheet in this catalogue refers to the ex factory condition and can increase after being mounted.

Bearing Load ratings
Bearing Load ratings are bearing specific data, derived
from the characteristics of the materials used. They are
used when selecting Spherical Plain Bearings or Rod
Ends for a particular load, but may have to be reduced
in adverse operating conditions.
Static Load ratings Co [kN]
Co indicates the maximum permissible static load
which a Rod End at its weakest cross section can 
withstand without developing permanent distortion.
The Co values listed in the tables of this brochure have
been calculated by using the appropiate material specifications and have been tested on a number of Rod
Ends during tensile tests carried out at ambient temperature. 80% of the yield strength resulting from the
tests have been used so that a safety factor of 1.25 is
included.   
The static load Co is also used for establishing the
maximum axial load which is limited by an additional
bending stress principally due to the method of 
fastening of the insert. Following are maximum axial
values (deformation) which have been established by
pressure testing:
(1)        Fa = Fa, zul = a . Co
[kN]
a = <~ 0,4 GXO MS
a = <~ 0,2 für GXSW, GXOW MS mounted in a 
FLURO® Rod End housing
a = <~ 0,1 für GE...EC-NIRO MS
For Spherical Plain Bearings Co indicates the radial
load, which does not deform the mating surface 
permanently. Precondition is the stable configuration
of the housing.
Dynamic Load ratings C [kN]
This rating is used to establish the working life of
Spherical Plain Bearings or Rod Ends when under
dynamic load conditions. That is to say when they
oscillate, rotate or pivot under load. The values listed in
the table result from multiplying the maximum surface
pressure pmax admissible in gliding movements by the
projected bearing surface. Aproj, whereby a specific
load rating is established for each type of Rod End.
The established standard values for maximum surface
load for various combinations of anti friction material
have been listed in table 1 which allows for movement
when oscillating.
Information: Depending on the material strength of the
Rod End housing (eg. pages 10 and 11) the static load
might be lower than the dynamic load.

Temperature / Material
Due to the use of special materials, FLURO® is able to design high performance bearings, which can operate 
within a temperature range of minus 50° to plus 720° Celsius / minus 58° to plus 1328° Fahrenheit. This high performance bearing can be used in the area of turbo chargers or exhaust return mechanisms. 
In the area of very aggressive substances such as sand, salt and dust these bearings are highly recommended.
They are also very resistant against vibration.

Installation instructions:
Attention: No tolerance or play can be allowed for the shaft when incorporated in the Ball or the Outer Ring when
incorporated in a housing. Through this it is guaranteed that the glide movement arises on the nodular 
gliding surface only. 
When mounting extra precaution has to be taken that the press force does not damage the bearing. The press 
force should not be initiated via the bearing itself. Thermal installation will reduce the necessary press force.
Axial locking of Spherical Plain Bearings:
When under high static or dynamic axial load, vibration, impacting load changes or high pivoting angles
Spherical Plain Bearings have to be locked axially. 
Possible locking methods:
- locking through several puncher points 
- caulking of bearing on the housing through a flanging groove
- with locking snap rings
- clamped with bushings on the facing surface of the Insert 
Pivoting Angle:

Шарнирные головки, сферические
подшипники скольжения, и наконечники
гидроцилиндров/пневмоцилиндров


2
Введение
Шарнирные головки и сферические подшипники скольжения собираются в соответствии с DIN ISO 12240 
(ранее - DIN 648) и готовы к установке. Эти детали используются для обеспечения беспроблемного движения 
между стержнем и корпусом, особенно в случаях не абсолютно прямолинейного движения.
Программа производства FLURO® включает сферические подшипники всех серий (DIN ISO 12240-1) 
и шарнирные головки серий К и Е (DIN ISO 12240-4), а также гидравлические шарнирные головки с 
привариваемой поверхностью или внутренней гаечной резьбой с винтом с цилиндрической головкой и 
внутренним шестигранником под ключ. Среди новых продуктов в каталоге: упорные подшипники и радиально-
упорные сферические подшипники. Продуктовая линейка также расширена за счет: угловых муфт, вильчатых 
головок, контргаек и резиновых прокладок.
В случае невозможности использования подшипников стандартных размеров, детали производятся в 
соответствии с заказом покупателя. В качестве альтернативы мы можем разрабатывать решения под особые 
потребности. Несколько таких деталей представлены на последних страницах каталога. Наши высококлассно 
обученные сотрудники с радостью предоставят качественную консультацию по любому запросу.
Благодаря высококлассному производственному оборудованию мы можем изгибать, шлифовать и фрезеровать 
детали с максимальной точностью. Список производственных возможностей мы можем предоставить 
дополнительно по запросу.
С июня 1997 наше производство одобрено в соответствии со стандартом качества DIN EN ISO 9001.
Наши менеджеры по продажам будут рады помочь Вам с любым запросом.
Совсем недавно наше производственные цеха были расширены и обновлены. Это позволило улучшить логистику 
и увеличить количество товарных запасов для обеспечения более быстрой доставки.

Для заказа специальных изделий, размеры или формы которых отличаются от стандартных, пошлите, 
пожалуйста, рисунок или набросок – смотри спецификацию специальных изделий на странице 116.
Инструкции по монтажу, критерии выбора, зазоры, допуски и расчеты, показанные в соответствующих 
разделах, являются необходимыми составляющими для правильного выбора подшипника, шарнирной 
головки, подходящих для конкретного применения.


Резьбы. Углы поворота.
Резьбы
Стандартные метрические, в соответствии с ISO DIN 13. Для увеличения прочности все стандартные  
шарнирные головки с внешней резьбой имеют катаную резьбу.
Максимальный угол поворота
Позволительный максимальный угол поворота (см. рис. 3 на странице 19) между 6° и 35° в зависимости от 
серии и конструктивного исполнения.
Максимальный угол поворота вы найдете технической спецификации серии K и серии E. 
Максимальные углы поворота указаны для ориентира в соответствии с состоянием 2. Другие варианты 
конструктивного исполнения и варианты расчета максимального угла поворота a указаны в состояниях 1 и 3.

Посадки. Монтаж.
Инструкции по монтажу:
Внимание: не допускается несоответствие размеров или биение для вала, когда он вставлен в Шар или 
Внешнее кольцо, когда он вставлен в корпус. Если это условие соблюдено, то скольжение возникает только 
в сфероидальной поверхности скольжения. 
Во время монтажа соблюдайте осторожность, чтобы сила запрессовки не повредила подшипник. Сила 
запрессовки должна быть приложена через сам шар. Путем охлаждения подшипника и нагрева корпуса 
можно уменьшить силу запрессовки.
Осевое закрепление сферических подшипников скольжения:
Во время высоких статических или динамических нагрузок, вибрации, внезапного изменения нагрузок 
или больших углов поворота должно быть проведено осевое закрепление сферических подшипников 
скольжения.
Возможные методы закрепления:
- закрепление с помощью кернера;
- уплотнение подшипника на корпусе с помощью фланцевой канавки;
- с помощью стопорных пружинных колец;
- зажатие с вкладышами на лицевой поверхности вставки.

Внутренний зазор
Для особых случаев применения шарнирные головки и сферические подшипники скольжения 
изготавливаются с меньшим или большим внутренним зазором. С2 имеет меньший, а C3 больший зазор, 
чем указано выше. Они доступны по запросу.
Под внутренним зазором понимается расстояние, на которое внутреннее кольцо или шар могут быть 
смещены в радиальном направлении относительно внешнего кольца из одного предельного положения в 
противоположное, измеренное при комнатной температуре. Осевое перемещение движения равно 
коэффициенту около 3 умноженному на внутренний зазор.

Смазывание

Сферические подшипники и шарнирные головки, не требующие обслуживания не должны смазываться. 
Внутренние кольца вращаются во вкладыше из фторопласта укрепленном в корпусе или внешнем кольце.
Шарнирные головки со сталью на специальной латуни или сталью на бронзе и сталью на стали требуют 
регулярной смазки. Первая смазка должна быть проведена во время монтажа. Интервал между смазками 
зависит от воздействующих факторов, таких как внешние условия (температура, пыль и др.) и механических 
воздействий во время применения (давление на поверхности, количество разнонаправленных нагрузок, угла 
поворота, скорости скольжения и пр.)
Для смазывания сферических подшипников скольжения вплоть до температуры +110° Цельсия (+230° 
Фаренгейта) рекомендуется белая паста, такая как Gleitmo 805k. Для больших температур от +110° до +220° 
Цельсия (+230° до +428° фаренгейта) мы рекомендуем высокотемпературные пасты, такие как Notropeen 
EHT2.
Смазываемые шарнирные головки серии K смазываются через штуцер, соответствующий DIN 3405.
Для Шарнирных головок Сталь по Стали серии E, размера начиная от 20 используются гидравлические 
штуцеры DIN 71412.
Температурный диапазон
Диапазон рабочих температур, при которых шарнирные головки и сферические подшипники скольжения 
могут работать приведен ниже:


fB = 1 
fB = 0,5 
Номинальные грузоподъемности
Номинальные грузоподъемности - это особые 
параметры подшипника, производные от используемых 
в нем материалов. Они употребляются при выборе 
сферического подшипника скольжения или шарнирной 
головки для определенной нагрузки, но возможно 
должны быть уменьшены при неблагоприятных 
условиях эксплуатации.
Статическая грузоподъемность Co [kN]
Co определяет максимально допустимую статическую 
нагрузку, которую может нести шарнирная головка 
без возникновения в наиболее слабом поперечном 
сечении 
необратимой 
деформации. 
Значения 
статических грузоподъемностей Co приведенные в 
таблице в этом каталоге были рассчитаны на основании 
характеристик соответствующих материалов и так же 
определены экспериментально при динаметрических 
испытаниях 
определенного 
числа 
шарнирных 
головок при комнатной температуре. Указанные 
цифры соответствуют 80% нагрузке, полученной 
в прочностных испытаниях, поэтому наличествует 
коэффициент запаса прочности 1.25.
Статическая грузоподъемность также используется 
для определения максимальной осевой нагрузки, которая 
ограничена дополнительным изгибным напряжением, 
зависящим от способа крепления вставки. Ниже 
приведены максимальные значения осевых нагрузок, 
полученные при динаметрических испытаниях:
(1)        Fa = Fa, max = a . Co       [kN ]
     a = <~ 0,4 для GI/GA + GIO/GAO + GXO
     a = <~ 0,2 для GXSW, GXS, GL установленные в

      корпусах шарнирных головок FLURO®
     a = <~ 0,1 для EI/EA, EI/EA...D-NIRO
Для сферических подшипников скольжения статическая 
грузоподъемность определяет радиальную нагрузку, 
которая не вызывает необратимую деформацию 
поверхностей соприкасающихся колец. При этом 
допускается, что корпус не деформируем.
Динамическая грузоподъемность C [kN]
Этот рейтинг используется для определения срока 
службы сферических подшипников скольжения или 
шарнирных головок во время динамических нагрузок. 
А именно, когда они колеблются, вращаются или 
поворачиваются от нагрузок. Значения в таблице 
получены 
путем 
умножения 
максимальной 
нагрузки на поверхности pmax, которое приложено 
во время скольжения, на площадь поверхности 
проектируемого подшипника. Aproj, это специфичное 
значение нагружения для каждого типа шарнирной 
головки. Установленные стандартные значения 
максимальной нагрузки на поверхности для разных 
комбинаций 
противофрикционного 
материала, 
которые позволяют движение во время колебания, 
перечислены в таблице 1. В зависимости от крепкости 
материала корпуса шарнирных головок (например, 
на страницах 34 и 35) статическое нагружение может 
быть меньше чем динамическое нагружение. Для 
этого случая используйте процедуру на странице 23.

Нагрузки действующие на сферический подшипник 
скольжения могут меняться. Они могут носить:
■  импульсный характер, быть постоянными или 

переменными (рисунок 1)
■  статическими или динамическими

Выбор размера подшипника
Этот выбор, обычно, делается пошагово и может 
проходить в несколько итераций, если необходимо 
путем сравнения -
1.	 Соотношению нагрузок, приложенных к подшипнику, 

к минимальному значению этого параметра;
2.	 Сил, действующих на подшипник и максимальной 

допустимой нагрузке для данного подшипника;
3.	 Максимальным давлением на поверхность и 

допустимым давлением для данного подшипника;
4.	 Максимальной допустимой скоростью скольжения и 

возможной скоростью скольжения;
5.	 Необходимыми эксплуатационными характеристиками 

и пределами эксплуатационных характеристик, 

приведенными в таблице.

Когда подшипник подвержен только статической нагрузке, ее

Когда шарнирная головка монтируется с использованием 
крепежной гайки или гаек дополнительная растягивающая 
нагрузка на внешнюю резьбу или на соединительный штифт 
должна быть принята во внимание.
Однако статическая или динамическая нагрузка всегда должна 
быть меньше, чем максимально допустимая грузоподъемность, 
которая вычисляется по значению номинальной статической 
грузоподъемности, используя формулу (6). В дальнейшем она 
должна быть исправлена с учетом коэффициента нагрузки

Расчет долговечности подшипников
Для статических нагрузок нет необходимости производить 
расчет долговечности. При силах, не превышающих 
80% от допустимого предела, статические силы могут 
действовать бесконечно долго.
Для 
динамических 
нагрузок 
расчет 
долговечности 
достаточно труден. Существует множество, иногда не 
зависимых факторов, которые все не могут быть приняты 
во внимание. Следовательно, расчет долговечности 
может быть только приблизительным. Как грубое 
приближение 
следует 
принять, 
что 
долговечность 
подшипника возрастает пропорционально росту его 
грузоподъемности при использовании его на средних 
скоростях. 
Дополнительные факторы влияния могут быть приняты в 
расчет использованием коэффициентов в формуле (11).

-	 GIRS из нержавеющей стали, в этом нет необходимости т.к. отсутствует коррозия.

	 Таким образом, мы можем выбрать шарнирную головку с внутренней резьбой 

	 типов GI, GIS, GIXS.

b) Размер	
Требуемый размер внутреннего кольца 16 мм и для шарнирной головки GIS 

нижеследующие значения могут быть определены из каталога на страницах 26 и 64

dk = 28,6 mm;   Co = 32,0 kN;   C = 21,5 kN

b1) требуемая статическая нагрузка Co [формула 7 + рисунок 1 + таблица 4]

Co, req  ≥  Fexist   =     2     = 4 kN

	 	           fB . fT      0,5 . 1

b2) требуемая динамическая нагрузка C [формула 5a + таблица 3]

Creq ≥ (C/F) min . F exist = 2 . 2 = 4 kN
        Проверка	
Co, exist = 32,0 kN > Co, req = 4 kN

       C  exist = 21,5 kN > C  req = 4 kN

Fr = 2 kN m Fr, max = Co . fB . fT = 32,0 . 0,5 . 1 = 16,0 kN
2. Проверка давления на соприкасающихся поверхностях [формула 8 + таблица 1]

pexist  =     pmax     =     50     =   50    = 4,65 N/mm2 < pmax = 50 N/mm2

             (C/F)exist     21,5/2      10,75

3. Проверка скорости скольжения [формула 9 + таблица 5]

 vm, exist  =       dk . ß . f         =   28,6 . 20 . 150   = 0,025 m/s < vmax = 0,25 m/s

                1000 . 57,3 . 60      1000 . 57,3 . 60   
4. Проверка рассеиваемой мощности [формула 10 +таблица 6]

 PL, exist = pexist 
. vm, exist = 4,65 . 0,025 = 0,12 W/mm2 < PL, max = 0,5 W/mm2
5. Подсчет долговечности [формула 11 + таблица 7 + 4 + 8 + 9]

        Gh ≈ 3 . f L 
. f T 
. f G . f V 
.   C/F   =  3 . 2 . 1 . 2,1 . 6 .  10,75   = 32.500 hrs.

                                                    v m  exist                    
0,025
6. Окончательный выбор

Следуя пунктам от 1b до 5. – может быть проведена также проверка шарнирных 

головок GI 16 и GIXS 16. При окончательном выборе типа подшипника, который будет

использован, в рассмотрение следует включить конструкцию, применение и цену 

каждого типа сравниваемых подшипников.
Примеры расчетов
(   ) 


Примеры расчетов
2. Примеры:
В механическом погрузочно-разгрузочном устройстве к шарнирной головке приложены радиальные силы в 
различных направлениях. Эти силы такие же, как показано на рисунке 4, странице 19. Четыре различные 
силы Fn i действующие в 4 промежутка времени имеют следующие характеристики:
Fr1 = 2 kN, t1 = 50%;   Fr2 = 4 kN, t2 = 16%;   Fr3 = 2,4 kN, t3 = 24%;   Fr4 = 1 kN, t4 = 10%; Дополнительно шар-
нирная головка подвергается воздействию постоянной осевой нагрузке Fa = 0,65 kN Шарнирная головка 
работает при максимальном угле отклонения β = 30°; частота осцилляции f = 60/мин.; макс. температуре 70°C
1. Первоначальный выбор шарнирной головки

a)	Тип	
Поскольку регулярное смазывание не возможно из-за труднодоступности следует выбрать

подшипника	 шарнирную головку не требующую обслуживания. Шарнирные головки GASW, GAXSW,

GARSW, GAOW могут подходить. Однако следующие типы должны быть исключены.

-	 GAOW – т.к. эти шарнирные головки подходят только для ограниченных перемещений.

-	 GARSW – поскольку окружающие условия не требуют коррозионной стойкости.

	 Таким образом, следует проверить типы с наружной резьбой.

b) Размер	
b0) Средняя и эквивалентная нагрузка [формула 3 + 4 + таблица 2]

Fm = 0,1    ∑ Fi2 . ti   =   0,1    22 . 50 + 42 . 16 + 2,42 . 24 + 12 . 10 = 2,46 kN

Fä = Fm + Y . Fa = 2,46 + 1,26 . 0,65 = 3,28 kN        Y = 1,26 для Fa/Fm = 0,65/2,46 = 0,26

b1) требуемая статическая грузоподъемность Co [формула 7 + рисунок 1 +таблица 4]

      Co,req  ≥  Fexist, ä  =    3,28   = 6,56 kN

                    fB . fT       0,5 . 1

b2) требуемая динамическая грузоподъемность C [формула 5a + таблица 3]

      Creq ≥ (C/F) min . F exist = 1,75 . 3,28 = 5,75 kN

c) Выбранная шарнирная головка GASW 12 С dk = 22,2 мм      и      Co = 23,5 kN C = 32,0 kN

    Проверка	 [формула 6 + 6a]

Co, exist = 23,5 kN > Co, req = 6,56 kN    Fr2 = 4,00 kN ≤ Fr, max = Co . fB . fT = 23,5 . 0,5 . 1 = 11,75 kN

C  exist = 32,0 kN > C  req = 5,75 kN    Fa 
 = 0,65 kN ≤ Fa, max = a 
. Fr, max = 0,2 . 11,75 = 2,35 kN

[a = 0,2 смотри формулу 1]

Замечания:	 При выборе размеров требуемая динамическая грузоподъемность Creq не

должна превосходить номинальную статическую грузоподъемность Co exist
2. Проверка давления на поверхность [формула 8 + таблица 1]

      pexist  =     pmax     =     150       =   150    = 15,38 N/mm2 < pmax = 150 N/mm2

                   (C/F)exist     32,0/3,28       9,75
3. Проверка скорости скольжения [формула 9 + таблица 5]

      vm, exist  =      dk . ß . f         =    22,2 . 30 . 60    =  0,011 m/s < vmax = 0,25 m/s

                     1000 . 57,3 . 60      1000 . 57,3 . 60   
4. Проверка рассеиваемой мощности [формула 10 + таблица 6]

      PL, exist = pexist 
. vm, exist = 15,38 . 0,011 = 0,17 W/mm2 < PL, max = 1,3 W/mm2
5. Вычисление долговечности [формула 11 + таблица 7 + 4 + 8 + 9]

      Gh ≈ 3 . f L 
. f T 
. f G . f V 
.   C/F   =  3 . 1 . 1 . 4,2 . 1   9,75    = 11.100 hrs.

                                                 v m  exist                   
0,011
6. Окончательный выбор

Для шарнирной головки типа GAXSW следует проделать шаги с 1 по 5, чтобы после этого 

сравнить нагрузки, цены и т.д. для каждого типа, для окончательного выбора типа шарнирной головки.

Основание в стальном корпусе цилиндрически обработано с одной стороны и, начиная от центральной линии, 
оно идет, чтобы соответствовать контуру шара (см. прилагаемый чертеж). 
Поэтому возможны большие осевые нагрузки на обработанном радиусе. 
Эта серия не позволяет производить повторную смазку через смазочный ниппель.
