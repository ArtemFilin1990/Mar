Machinery is being made smaller and more compact; the same is demanded
of bearings.
NTN seal and shield type ball bearings are built to meet these trends.
They simplify shaft design, are maintenance-free, and are the bearing of
choice for an increasing number of applications.

Table 1  Bearing design and futures
Grooved Type Sealing figure for
Excellent Performance〔all models〕
A v-shaped groove is cut around the
inner ring. Under centrifugal force, the
outer surface of the v acts to keep out
dirt; the inner surface of the v acts to
seal in the grease.
Double-lip Seal Adjusts for Wear
〔LLU spec〕
The inner lip of a double-lip seal is pressed against the
inside surface of the V-groove; the outer lip is spread open
by the elastic force of rubber to create a small gap
between the outer lip and the inner ring. Should the inner
lip wear, the contact pressure will decrease; however, the
outer lip will get closer to the inner ring. In effect, a
constant degree of sealing will be maintained; and, as a
result, bearing service life will be noticeably lengthened.
Rust Resistant Shield〔ZZ spec〕
In order to obtain rust resistant properties, the shield is
made of a strip steel covered by a hard surface-coating.
This assures long bearing service life and minimal noise
levels.

3. Service Life of Prelubricating Grease
The service life of filled grease is influenced by many
factors: operating conditions, temperature, atmosphere,
etc. There is even a considerable difference by grease
brands. Keeping this in mind, Figure 3 presents a scale for
determining grease service life. It is based on actual and
experimental data; and applies to high-quality grease used
in ball bearings under normal operating conditions.
As the working temperature increases, the grease life, of
course, becomes shorter. Although not accurate for all
greases, Figure 3 is valid, in general, for working
temperatures up to 80˚C; for working temperatures over
80˚C. service life decreases to about two-thirds for every
10˚ over 80˚C. (Please note that this does not apply to
calcium-soap and aluminum-soap greases.)
Example
The following method is used to obtain the grease life of
deep groove ball bearing 6206ZZ at a radial load of 1520
N and a operating speed, n, of 3600 r/min. From the
appropriate Dimension Table we find that the standard
load rating, Cr, for a 6206ZZ bearings is 19500 N and the
limiting speed is 11000 r/min. (Use the value for ZZ or LLB
even if the bearings of LLU specifications).
Divide Cr by the equivalent radial load, Pr. You will obtain
12.8 (19500/1520~~12.8). Next go to Figure 4 to determine
the value for fL. (For Cr/Pr=12.8. fL=1). Find fL・n0/n.
(1.0・11000/3600~~3.1).
With your value of fL・n0/n' (3.1 in this example) go to
Figure 3 and find this value on Scale @. Call this point B.
The bore diameter, d, of the bearing is 30. Find this value
on Scale ! and call this point A. Draw a straight line
between Points A and B. The line will intersect Scale # at
some point which will be Called Point C. In this example,
Point C is 17000 hours. This is the expected grease life of
the bearing which is what we were looking for.

Note that NTN can also manufacture shield and seal type
small diameter ball bearings of dimensions other than
those shown on the subsequent dimension tables. Contact
NTN for more information. 
¡Use under high or low temperature
¡Low torque is required
¡High speeds are required
¡Grease leakage must be avoided
¡Use under other special conditions
Also note that the performance of prelubricated ball
bearings is affected by operating conditions and grease
type. For information on performance under special
conditions, please contact NTN.
