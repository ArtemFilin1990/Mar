■Structure and Features
IKO Combined Type Needle Roller Bearings are combinations of a radial bearing and a thrust bearing. 
Caged needle roller bearings are used as radial bearings and thrust ball bearings or thrust roller bearings 
are used as thrust bearings.  They are compact and 
very economical, and can be subjected to radial loads 
and axial loads simultaneously.
They are widely used for machine tools, textile 
machinery, and industrial machinery.

Needle Roller Bearings with Thrust Ball 
Bearing
In this series, needle roller bearings are combined 
with thrust ball bearings to receive thrust loads.
In bearings with a dust cover, the dust cover is formed 
from a thin steel plate and fixed to a groove cut on the 
outer cylindrical surface of the outer ring collar.  The 
cover forms a labyrinth with the thrust raceway ring, 
and is therefore effective in preventing leakage of 
grease and penetration of dust and dirt.
In the case of bearings without an inner ring, the tolerances of roller set bore diameter Fw are shown in 
Table 14 on page A33.  Therefore, the required radial 
internal clearances can be selected by combining the 
bearings with shafts that have been heat-treated and 
finished by grinding as shown in Table 23 on page 
A42 and Table 26 on page A44.

The identification number of Combined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings consists of a model code, dimensions, any supplemental codes and a classification 
symbol.  Some examples are shown below.
■Identification Number
Needle Roller Bearings with Thrust Roller 
Bearing
In this series, needle roller bearings are combined 
with thrust roller bearings to receive thrust loads.
Their axial load ratings are greater than those of bearings that are combined with thrust ball bearings.  Also, 
elastic deformation of the rolling contact surfaces 
under load is minimal.  Furthermore, the thrust bearing section is finished to high accuracy, and therefore 
high rotational accuracy is obtained in the case of 
both vertical and horizontal shafts.
Like the needle roller bearings with thrust ball bearing, 
this series also includes bearings with a dust cover 
and bearings with an inner ring.
Needle Roller Bearings with Angular Contact Ball Bearing
In this series, caged needle roller bearings are combined with angular contact ball bearings to receive 
thrust loads.  These bearings conform to the international dimension series #59, which is based on the 
ISO Standard.  They can withstand heavy radial loads 
and unidirectional axial loads simultaneously.
When the axial load exceeds 25% of the radial load, 
the radial load will be induced in the angular contact 
ball bearing, and bearing life will be affected.  The 
relationship between the two loads must therefore be 
taken into careful consideration.
Needle Roller Bearings with Three-point 
Contact Ball Bearing
These bearings can withstand heavy radial loads and 
bi-directional axial loads at the same time during highspeed rotation.
Since the non-interchangeable inner rings are separated at the center of the ball raceway surface, they 
must be firmly tightened against the shaft in the axial 
direction.  The axial clearance of this bearing is 0.1 〜
0.3 mm, and like NATA59, the axial load should not 
exceed 25% of the radial load.
■Accuracy
Dimensional accuracy and rotational accuracy of 
Combined Type Needle Roller Bearings are based on 
Table 2 below and Tables 12 and 13 on page A31. 
The tolerances for the smallest single roller set bore 
diameter of bearings without inner ring are based on 
Table 14 on page A33.  Thickness variations of thrust 
rings of NAX(I) and NBX(I) are based on Table 2.4 on 
page F5.
Bore diameter of the small width inner ring of NATB59 
is made for a transition fit with k5 tolerance shaft.
Fig.1 shows mounting examples of Combined Type 
Needle Roller Bearings. When applying preload to the 
NAX and NBX models, it is recommended that thrust 
raceway rings are not tightened directly with nuts, but 
are tightened using springs as shown in Fig. 2.
Mounting two NATA models symmetrically allows 
them to be subjected to two-way axial loads.  When 
mounting these models, an axial clearance of 0.2 〜
0.3 mm should be provided in the angular contact ball 
bearings so that radial loads are not applied to the 
angular contact ball bearings.
Dimensions related to mounting should be based on 
the table of dimensions.
■Mounting
■Fit
The recommended fits for Combined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings are shown in Table 3.
■Clearance
Combined Type Needle Roller Bearings are manufactured to have the radial internal clearance CN shown 
in Table 18 on page A37.
■Rating Life
In Combined Type Needle Roller Bearings, caged 
needle roller bearings are subjected to radial loads 
while thrust bearings receive axial loads.  Therefore, it 
is necessary to calculate their lives respectively (page 
A17).
■Lubrication
Grease is not prepacked in Combined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings, so perform proper lubrication for use. 
Operating without lubrication will increase the wear of 
the rolling contact surfaces and shorten the bearing 
life.

Notes(1)　The housing bore for the thrust bearing must be 
machined to be more than 0.5 mm larger than the outside diameters D1 and D2 to ensure that it does not 
incur radial loads.
(2)　If the fit is made tighter than specified in this table, radial 
loads will act upon the thrust bearing, limiting its function.
■Oil Hole
The outer ring of Combined Type Needle Roller 
Bearings has an oil groove and an oil hole.  When 
outer rings with multiple oil holes or inner rings with oil 
hole(s) are required, please contact IKO.
