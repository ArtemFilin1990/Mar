2. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SELECTION OF BEARING TYPE 

2.1. 
Selection of bearing type according to the direction and magnitude of loads 
The magnitude and direction of loads greatly influence the selection of bearings. 
Generally, for the same dimensions, the cylindrical roller bearing stands heavy loads than the deep 
groove balls bearing. The bearings with more rows of rolling elements, especially rollers have heavy load 
carring capacity. According to the load acting direction, the following situation are distinguished: 
a. 
Radial load 
Cylindrical roller bearings without ribs at one of the rings, with one row of rollers (type N or NU) or 
with two rows of rollers (type NN or NNU) and needle roller bearings are to be used. 
b. 
Axial load 
Thrust balls or roller bearings according to the load magnitude, are to be used. The simple effect thrust 
roller bearings can be loaded only in a single direction and the double effect thrust roller bearings can be loaded 
in both directions. 
c. 
Combined load 
The simultaneous action of radial and axial load means that on the roller bearing acts a combined load. 
For light axial loads together with radial loads are used: 
 
Deep groove ball bearings, single row. (Combined load supported rises if the radial clearance is greater 
than normal); 
 
Cylindrical roller bearings of the NUP and NJ+HJ types and spherical roller bearings. 
 
NJ type cylindrical roller bearings can only accommodate axial loads acting in a single direction and for 
axial displacement of the shaft in both directions it is recommended to mount roller bearings of the same type. 

 Figure 2.1 

If the axial load is heavy, a thrust bearing must be mounted together with a radial roller bearing. The 
angular contact balls bearing or four-point contact bearings (Q or QJ type) used when axial load predominates 
are mounted with clearance fit for housing. 
In case of combined loads in which heavy axial load predominates, angular contact ball bearings single 
or double rows taper roller bearings or spherical roller thrust bearings. The above are presented in figure 2.1. in 
which the black triangles indicate the loads direction for which the respective bearing was designed and the 
white triangles are indicating the possible loads. 
The size of the bearings is selected considering the condition of life requirements ensuring for imposed 
conditions of load, rating life and reliability of operation. Selection is done on the basis of a characteristic 
variable: basic load ratings. 

d. 
Basic static load 
Basic static load, Cor, is given in the bearings catalogues for every size and it is taken in consideration 
when the bearing is stationary, has slow oscillations, low speed (n<10 rot/min) or when during the rotating these 
must support heavy shock loads. In this case, the operation safety is determined by the size of the deformations 
of the raceway of the bearing. 


6

Basic static load is determined according to ISO 76 and represents the load that produces a permanent 
deformation of 0.0001 from the diameter of the rolling element, the load being purely radial for radial bearings 
and purely axial for thrust bearings. 

The combined static load (radial and axial loads that are acting simultaneously on a bearing) must be 
converted into an equivalent load which results from the general formula:  
P0=X0·Fr+Y0·Fa, [kN] 
where: 𝑷𝑷𝟎𝟎  equivalent static load of the roller bearing,  [kN] 
𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓  the radial component of the heavy static load in [kN] 
𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂  the axial component of the heavy static load in [kN] 
𝑿𝑿𝟎𝟎  the radial load factor of the bearing 
𝒀𝒀𝟎𝟎  the axial load factor of the bearing 
𝑿𝑿𝟎𝟎 and 𝒀𝒀𝟎𝟎 are given in the bearings tables and catalogues according to the type of the bearing and ratio Fa/Fr. 

Knowing the shaft diameter “d”, the size of the bearing is determined from the condition of inequality: 
𝑪𝑪𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎≥𝒔𝒔𝟎𝟎∙𝒇𝒇𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎∙𝑷𝑷𝟎𝟎, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
where:  𝒔𝒔𝟎𝟎 is a static safety factor coefficient chosen according to table 2.1 (for the non-rotating bearings or for 
the bearings with oscillating movements) and table 2.2 (for rotating- bearings subject to oscillating loads or 
heavy shock loads with short duration).  

The heavy shock loads that are higher than the basic static load of the bearing are producing residual 
deformations not uniformly distributed on raceway which negatively influence the good operation of the roller 
bearing. 
At high operating temperatures Cor is corrected with the following factor: 
Temperature 
150C 
200C 
250C 
300C 
𝒇𝒇𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎 
0,95 
0,85 
0,75 

When more bearings of the same type are mounted close together, the static load supported will be 
determined with the following relation: 
𝑪𝑪𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎= 𝑪𝑪𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎∙𝒊𝒊, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
where:  𝑪𝑪𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎 - basic static load of the bearing group, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
𝑪𝑪𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎 - basic static load of the single bearing taken from tables, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
𝒊𝒊 - number of bearings. 

e. Basic dynamic load 
For the bearings in which at least one of the rings rotates with a rotation speed n 10 rot/min, the 
operation in safety is mainly determined by the contact fatigue or abrasive wear. Considering of a foremost 
importance the contact fatigue failure phenomena (apparition of pitting or material spalling), the value of basic 
dynamic load, Cr. is indicated in bearing catalogues for each type dimension. This represents the allowable load 
for which the bearing has a rating life of 1 million rotations and it is determined according to ISO 281. 
The basic dynamic load for the achievement of  the required rating life and for the shaft diameter “d” is 
derived from the following inequality: 𝑪𝒓𝑳𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝒑𝑷𝒓𝒌𝒌

where: L10 - basic rating life, in millions of revolutions 
Pr - equivalent dynamic load, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
p - exponent of the life equation having the following values: 
 
p=3 for balls bearings 
 
p=10/3 for roller bearings 
Having known the Lh basic rating life in hours and rotation speed n, in rev/min, the variable L10 is 
determined with the following relation: 
𝑳𝑳𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏= (𝒏𝒏∙𝑳𝑳𝒉𝒉∙𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔) 𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔, [𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 𝒐𝒐𝒇𝒇 𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓]

The equivalent dynamic load, Pr, is determined with the following relation: 
𝑷𝑷𝒓𝒓= 𝒇𝒇𝒅𝒅∙(𝑿𝑿∙𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓+ 𝒀𝒀∙𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂), [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
𝒇𝒇𝒅𝒅= 𝒇𝒇𝒌𝒌∙𝒇𝒇𝒔𝒔∙𝒇𝒇𝒓𝒓 
where: 𝒇𝒇𝒅𝒅  - the dynamic coefficient which takes into account the fact that the forces acting on bearings display 
deviations due to execution errors of the devices transmitting the movement, vibrations); 
𝒇𝒇𝒌𝒌 = coefficient due to the precision of the gear on the shaft of the calculated bearing is mounted; 
𝒇𝒇𝒔𝒔 = coefficient due to the additional forces specific to machine operation; 
𝒇𝒇𝒓𝒓 = coefficient taken into account only for shafts and axles bearings for the vehicles wheel. In other 
cases 𝒇𝒇𝒌𝒌= 𝒇𝒇𝒓𝒓= 𝟏𝟏 

The equivalent dynamic load 𝑷𝑷𝒓𝒓 is calculated according to the type of bearing for which the values of 𝑿𝑿 
and 𝒀𝒀 factors (radial load factor respective axial load factor for the bearing) are given in catalogues and bearing 
tables, determined by the ratio: 
𝒆𝒆= 𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓

where: 𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓– radial component , [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌]; 
𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂– axial component , [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌]. 

In many operation cases, the size of the load and rotational speed are variable, when an average 
constant radial 𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 or axial 𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 load must be calculated for the calculus of the dynamic equivalent load. 
i. 
If at constant rotational speed the force acting on the rolling bearing linearly varies between a 
minimum value 𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎, 𝒂𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 and a maximum value 𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎, 𝒂𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎, keeping its direction within a 
certain interval of time, the medium load results from the following relation: 
𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎,𝒏𝒏= (𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓,𝒂𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎+ 𝟐𝟐∙𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓,𝒂𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎) 𝟑𝟑,
⁄  [kN] 
ii. 
If the radial load that acts on a rolling bearing is made of a force 𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 which is constant in size and 
direction (for example the weight of a rotor) and a constant rotation force 𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 (for example the 
unbalancing phenomena), the average load results from: 
𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎= 𝒇𝒇𝒎𝒎∙(𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓+ 𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓), [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
The values for 𝒇𝒇𝒎𝒎 coefficient are obtained from the figure 2.2 
iii. 
For a radial load, 𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓 applied on bearing which oscillates from a central position through an angle 
𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐 (see figure 2.3), the average radial load is done by the following relation: 
𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎= 𝒇𝒇𝟎𝟎∙𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓, [𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌] 
with values for 𝒇𝒇𝟎𝟎 coefficient given in table 2.3 according to the oscillation angle 𝜸𝜸 and the 
exponent of the life formula, 𝒑𝒑. 
For variable loads in size, time and direction and for different rotational speeds, the average dynamic 
loads given by the following formula:  
𝑭𝑭𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎,𝒂𝒂= [𝚺𝚺(𝑭𝑭𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊,𝒂𝒂∙𝒑𝒑∙𝒏𝒏𝒊𝒊) 𝒏𝒏
⁄ ]
𝟏𝟏𝒑𝒑

𝒏𝒏𝒊𝒊 - the no. of rotations corresponding to 𝑭𝑭𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊,𝒂𝒂 loads 
𝒑𝒑 = 3 for ball bearings and; 10/3 for roller bearings 

If the required basic dynamic load is greater than all values indicated in the catalogue for shaft diameter, 
𝒅𝒅, the following solutions could be considered: 
selection of another bearing type that secures for the same diameter d, superior basic dynamic loads when 
the other restrictions (rotational speed, dimensions, possibility of supporting the type of the applied loads) 
are satisfied; 
improvement of the shaft diameter (if constructive and mounting condition allow this); 
assembling two or even more identical bearings, the base dynamic load of the i bearings assembly being 
calculated with the following relation:

To take evenly the loads, these bearings must be paired so that the diameter and radial clearance 
deviations are max. 1/2 of the allowed tolerance field. Relation  which refers to the basic dynamic load of the 
roller bearing indicated in roller bearing tables depends on “basic rating life” (𝑳𝑳𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏) which, according to ISO 281 
means the life attained or exceeded by 90% of the bearing group of the same type dimension operating in the 
same conventional conditions (good mounting, protection against foreign particles penetration, correct 
lubrication, correct loading, non-exposed to extreme speeds and temperatures). After bearing selection 
(according to the basic dynamic load), it is recommended to determine its effective life (adjusted rating life for 
conditions different from those mentioned in ISO 281) with the following relation: 
𝑳𝑳𝒏𝒏= 𝒂𝒂𝟏𝟏∙𝒂𝒂𝟐𝟐∙𝒂𝒂𝟑𝟑∙𝒇𝒇𝒕𝒕∙(𝑪𝑪𝒓𝒓𝑷𝑷𝒓𝒓
)𝒑𝒑 
where: 𝑳𝑳𝒏𝒏 – adjusted rating life (mil. of rotations); 
𝒂𝒂𝟏𝟏 - correction factor that takes into account the reliability (table 2.4); 
𝒂𝒂𝟐𝟐 - correction factor that takes into account the quality of the material and manufacturing technology 
(for materials and technologies used for manufacturing URB bearings 𝒂𝒂𝟐𝟐= 𝟏𝟏); 
𝒂𝒂𝟑𝟑  - correction factor that takes into account the operating conditions and lubrication quality. 
𝒇𝒇𝒕𝒕 – correction factor according to the operation temperature (table 2.6). 
The connection between these two last connection factors leads to their fusion into a single factor, 𝒂𝒂𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐, 
whose value is given in table 2.5 and depends on the ratio between the cinematic viscosity of the oil at 40C, 𝝊𝝊 
initial in cSt or mm2/s (see figure 2.4) and the viscosity required for a correct lubrication at the operation 
temperature, 𝝊𝝊𝟏𝟏 (see figure 2.5).

Example of calculation of the kinematic viscosity of the oil: For a bearing with Dm = 85 mm which 
operates at a rotational speed of 3500 rot/min, it results from figure 2.4  = 8 mm2/s. From figure 2.5 
results that for the operating temperature of 70C to obtain 1 viscosity it is required an initial 
viscosity of = 20 mm2/s. 
a. Abrasive wear 
In cases of unsuitable operating conditions (abrasive particles contaminated environment, non-coaxial 
positioning of the roller bearings that facilitates the occurrence of the abrasive wear between the cages and 
rolling elements) appears an increase of the radial clearance of the bearing.

2.2. Bearing selection according to rotational speed and operating temperature 

Maximum (limit) rotational speed to which a bearing may be subject to is indicated in bearings tables 
and catalogues for greasing and oil lubrication 
The values are approximate and valid if bearings are used for loads corresponding to a rating life Lh  
150.000 hours and operate in the following conditions: 
good rigidity of the shaft and housing 
adequate greasing conditions

adequate sealing 
In the case in which the bearings operating conditions are not known it is recommended that the 
effective rotational speed not to exceed 75% of the rotational speed indicated in the catalogue. 
For heavy loads applied to bearings with the mean diameter greater than 100 mm when the rating life 
L10 is smaller than 75.000 hours, the limit rotational speed indicated by the catalogue shall be multiplied with 
the factor f0 from figure 2.8.  
For combined loads applied to bearings, the rotational speed indicated in the catalogue shall be 
multiplied with the factor f1 from figure 2.9

The increase of the maximum rotational speed above the limit value mentioned in the catalogue could be 
realized both through the use of higher precision bearing classes in the same time with the increase of the shaft 
and housing manufacturing precision and through the improvement of the greasing and cooling conditions.

For high rotational speed the bearings of small size series are to be preferred. 

In case of pure radial loads carrying, radial ball or roller bearings can support the higher rotational 
speeds. 

In the case of combined loads carrying, even in the case in which the axial loads are foremost will be 
preferred radial - axial ball bearings. 
In the case of spherical (ball or roller) bearings when axial loads are predominating, it is recommended 
to reduce the upper limit of the maximum rotational speed. 
For all bearings used at high rotational speeds it is recommended the use of a radial clearance greater 
than the normal one (groups C3, C4, C5). 
Maximum operating temperature to which the bearings designed for normal applications can be used is 
of 120C. Over this temperature in the material of the contact elements (rings and rolling elements) there are 
produced structural transformations with negative implications over the dimensional stability and physical and 


12
mechanical characteristics which determine the resistance to contact fatigue and, through implication, to the life 
of the bearing. 
Thus, at higher temperatures it is recommended to use special bearings having the component parts 
made of special steel brands or stabilized through thermal treatments. These bearings have special symbols. 
Remark:  When the working conditions of bearing allow great temperature differences in operation for 
the two rings (interior and exterior) we recommend the use of bearings with radial clearance greater than normal 
(groups C3, C4, C5). 

2.3. 
Bearing type selection according to rotational precision and noise conditions required 
A bearing precision class is chosen according to the prescriptions imposed to the rotational precision for 
the shaft of mechanism (radial and axial wobbling). For the great majority of the mechanisms in machines 
engineering are used P0 precision class bearings. 
The use of higher precision bearings (P6, P5, P4) is imposed in the case of special applications: high 
rotational speed, very low noise level, high movement precision. 
Examples of such assemblies are bearings for the main shafts of rectifying and precision-finishing 
machines, bearings of precision devices (measuring, control or medical devices), engines bearings, etc. 
It must be taken into account the fact that a bearing even ideally manufactured will generate noise when 
operating having the pieces in contact with it and mainly the shaft and the housing will modify through their low 
precision the ideal form of a bearing components or they will determine an axial displacement or a tilting of the 
rings over the established limits. 
Having in view the above mentioned, to reduce the level of vibrations and noise produced by the 
bearings, it is recommended that: 
 
the tolerances established for form and position deviations of shafts and housings must be by two or three 
classes more accurate than those mentioned for normal precision bearings; 
 
very clean lubricants be employed, granting special attention to handling, greasing and sealing the bearings; 
 
bearings with radial clearance smaller than normal must be employed; 
 
the exaggerate pre-load of the bearing that produces elastic deformation of the rings that allow to noise 
increasing must be avoided. 

We mention that the noise level in bearings increases linearly with the bore diameter. Also, in roller 
bearings the noise level is greater than in ball bearings. 

2.4. 
Selection of a bearing type according to permissible deviations of concentricity  
In some constructions it is very difficult to avoid the angular deviations, shaft tilting and housing 
deformation. These could be produced when: 
 the distances between bearings are large; 
 the bores of the two housings could not be processed through a single fixing; 
 the housings are fixed on different foundations or on welded metallic constructions. 
In these cases will be selected mainly spherical bearing types, the bearing type being determined by the 
tilting angle between the inner and the outer rings. (see table 2.9). The use of bearings in constructions in which 
coaxially deviation between shaft and housing exceeds the permitted limit leads to their rapid failure. We 
mention that bearings with spherical exterior surface (Type Y truck runner bearings) are not designed to process 
continuous oscillating movements. 
Continuous compensation of the angular deviations is best achieved in spherical roller bearings. 
2.5. 
Bearing selection according to its role within the assembly (locating or non-locating  
bearing) 
According to the mode in which the two bearings of the assembly take part in the process of taking over 
the axial forces that load the shaft, there are two bearing solutions: 
a. fixed  or locating bearing (driving) and free or non-locating bearing (driven); 
This solution is recommended in case of medium or large length shafts where temperature variations during 
operation are possible. 

The fixed bearing has the role to take over the due radial reaction and the entire axial force of the shaft, 
in both directions. 

The driving bearing is fixed both on the shaft and on the housing for this establishing the bearing that is 
radially light loaded. As driving bearing can be used any bearing which can support combined loads. 

The free bearing takes over the radial reaction allowing in the same time the axial displacement against 
the housing, avoiding thus an additional loading of the bearings with axial forces following the thermal 


13
g
dilatation of the shaft. The axial displacement could be obtained inside a bearing using cylindrical roller 
bearings without ribs (type N or NU). 

In case of significant axial displacements, it is provided to move the entire roller bearing using an 
adequate fit between the outer ring and the housing. 

If the outer ring rotates, the axial displacement can be realized between the inner ring and the shaft. 

In case of shaft supported by more bearings, one of them will be axially fixed, the other ones being free 
to move axially. In case of cross location the two bearings are mounted in opposition, the shaft being guided by 
every bearing only in a single direction. This system is especially recommended only for short shafts. The shafts 
and bores in which the opposite bearings are to be mounted must be axially tolerated so that operation must not 
produce a pre-straining of the bearings. 
b. cross location (interchangeable). 

 Figure 2.11 
2.5.1. Bearing axial location 
In order to achieve an axial location of bearings there is a great number of solutions according to the 
bearing type and magnitude of load to be taken over. Figure 2.10 presents schematic examples of axial location 
for fixed bearings and figure 2.11 presents the same for free bearings.. 
In cases in which no axial load is transmitted through a certain bearing, a ring could be used of an interference 
fit only. 
The most common axial location system is performed by means of cover, nuts and screw plates etc. 
through axial supporting of the bearing rings. 
For light axial loads, axial location systems could be achieved by means of safety rings. 
Due to a low height of the safety rings and of exterior connecting radius of the bearings rings, 
sometimes intermediate rings are required, mounted between the bearing and the safety ring. 
When a low interference fit is used for the inner ring  in order to avoid its rotation against the shaft, a 
lock washer will be introduced between the bearing ring and the lock nut. 
The lock washer will have a tenon that entering in a groove in the shaft will disconnect the transmission 
of the friction forces to the nut thus eliminating the danger of breaking the lock nuts. 
Another axial location system is achieved through the taper pressed assemblies, using adapter or 
withdrawal sleeves. 
This system is possible only for tapered bore roller bearings and has the following advantages: 
 heavy axial loads could be taken over in both directions; 
 it is not necessary a high manufacturing precision for the shaft; 
 ensures an easy mounting and dismounting. 

It is however necessary to support the inner ring of the bearing on the shaft collar or on a snap ring 
which in case of using the withdrawal sleeve prevents the axial displacement for heavy axial loads and in the 
case of adapter sleeve it facilitates bearing dismounting.  

                                                         Figure 2.10 
2.5.2. Compensation of thermal dilatations of the pieces in connection with bearings 
In case when the shaft elongation determined by the increase of the temperature of the bearing assembly 
during operation is not taken over by a non-locating bearing, the axial clearance of the bearing is reduced, the 
result being the jamming of the component part of the roller bearing (rings and rolling elements) reducing its 
life. The size of shaft elongation with the temperature is illustrated by the following relation: 
𝚫𝚫𝒍𝒍= 𝜶𝜶∙𝒍𝒍∙(𝒕𝒕𝟐𝟐−𝒕𝒕𝟏𝟏), [𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎] 
 where: 𝒕𝒕𝟐𝟐 - shaft working temperature, [°𝑪𝑪]; 𝒕𝒕𝟏𝟏 - environment temperature, [°𝑪𝑪]; 
𝒍𝒍 - length of the shaft, [𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎] ; 𝜶𝜶 - thermal dilatation coefficient for the shaft [°𝑪𝑪]−𝟏𝟏. 
The axial clearances between rotating pieces and fixed pieces of the labyrinth sealing devices must be 
enough large so that the thermal dilatation of the shaft does not determine frictions between these pieces.

3. MOUNTING SPECIFICATIONS IN BEARING ASSEMBLIES 

3.1. Loading modes of bearing rings 
The selection of the bearings mounting fits depends on the type and magnitude of bearing, on operating 
conditions (lubrication, temperature etc.) and also on the loads direction and magnitude. The greater the loads 
with chokes on the rotating load ring, the greater the fit tightening. 
According to the direction of the load that acts on the bearing, there are three cases of ring loading 
(presented in table 3.1):

a. Carrying with stationary load when the load (resultant) is continuously oriented towards the same point 
of the raceway. The ring subject of a stationary load can be mounted with clearance fit (h6, g6, j6, H7, 
H8, G7). 
b. Carrying with rotating load when the resultant load is successively supported on all circumference of 
the bearing raceway or only on a portion of this circumference. The ring subject to a rotation load must 
be mounted with tight fit (j5, k6, m5, m6, p6, r6, H6, J6, J7, K6, K7, M7, N7).

c. Undetermined carrying, when the load has undefined variable directions from the bearing rings (shocks, 
vibrations or unbalance motions in high rotation speed machines). In case of the undetermined carrying, both 
rings are to be mounted with tight fit. 
The magnitude of the load is determined by the ratio between the dynamic equivalent load (Pr) and the base 
dynamic load of the bearing (𝑪𝑪𝒓𝒓, calculated according to ISO 281). 

There are three main types of load according to this ratio:

3.2. Selecting the bearing fits 
Bearing fits are selected on the basis of the following criteria: 
a. firm location and uniform support of bearings; 
b. simply mounting and dismounting; 
c. axial displacement of non-locating bearing. 
According as the operation conditions, between the inner ring and the shaft, between the outer ring and 
the housing, respectively clearance fits, intermediate fits or interference fits may be performed. 
When selecting the fit, one has to consider the difference of temperature which may occur between ring 
and shaft or between ring and housing. The tolerance classes are available for bearing fits which do not exceed 
+120C during operation. 
A high tightening is recommended for roller bearings and large size bearings in comparison to ball 
bearings of the same size. In case of a tight fit, the inner ring is supported by the entire shaft contact surface, 
thus bearing is used at full load carrying capacity. 
When selecting a fit, the load of the rotating ring has to be considered and it will be avoided the 
excessive clearances or tightening. The excessive tightening couldn’t eliminate only the radial mounting 
clearance of the bearing itself but can determine even the destruction of the ring in the mounting process 
(because of the tensions stress that are resulting from the ring). 
At their turn, the excessive clearances may determine the reduction of the ensemble rigidity and the 
occurrence of the contact corrosion phenomenon due to the excessive mobility of the joint. 

3.2.1. Tolerance classes for shafts 
Table 3.2 recommends the selection of the tolerance classes for the shaft according to the bearing type, 
loading mode and shaft diameter.   

3.2.2. 
Tolerance classes for housing bores 
Table 3.4. recommends the selection of the housing tolerance classes. 
Surfaces roughness of shaft and housing seating are given in table 3.5.  
If bearings are mounted with adapter or withdrawal sleeves, shaft surface roughness should be of 
maximum Ra = 1,6 m.

3.2.3. 
Special fits for some types of bearings 
In certain cases the selection of optimum fits for a bearing must be given up. Between these cases there 
is the design of mechanisms devices which during exploitation must be often dismounted to remove the 
bearings from their mounting places. For devices of cheap and low-importance machines for which it is not 
economical to process precisely and complexly the mounting places on the shaft, bearing tight fits will not be 
used. The same recommendation goes for shafts whose life is much longer than the one of mounted bearings 
and their frequent replacement would lead to an unavoidable wear of the spindles.

In all these cases it is rational to use larger clearance fits than the theoretical ones namely less tightening 
fits and to avoid the rings rotation from the mounting places are used pins, keys or other fixing devices. 
Normal precision bearings are usually used and only in a few special cases will be used enlarged 
precision bearings, for example in bearings of main shafts of grinding machines or of high precision lathes and 
for bearings of high rotation speed shafts where it is required to limit the centrifugal forces resulted from the 
rotation of the non-balanced elements and in electric motors. In case of using high precision class bearings, the 
shafts and housings must have a rigid construction and their processing accuracy must be at the level of bearing 
precision. Form deviations of shafts and housing bores will be two or three classes more accurate than the 
deviations mentioned for normal precision bearings. Thus, for high precision bearings (P5 or higher), used for 
machine tools, the housing bore will have to have K6 dimensional deviations and IT3 form deviations. 
In the case in which the bearing bore is tapered, the tolerance of the form deviation of the housing bore 
will be smaller, respective IT2. Often it is recommended the dynamic balancing of the shafts. 
Since in the mounting process the bearing rings shape up according to the part form on which these are 
mounted, it is useless and non-economic to recommend high precision bearings be mounted on the shafts and 
housings with major form deviations.

3.3.1. Stationary seals 
The simplest sealing used in bearings are spring washers (shields). This type of sealing is used for 
peripheral speeds up to 6 m/s in clean and dry environments and their efficiency depends on the clearance 
between the washer and the shaft in rotation, the housing, respectively or on the radial clearance of the bearing. 
For this reason, the check washers can be used for bearings with minimal radial clearance. When spring washer 
3.3.  Bearing sealing  
The correct sealing systems ensure a normal operation life to bearings and even the operation of the 
entire mechanism by their protection against penetration into the bearing of injurious elements (dust, material 
particles, humidity, acids etc.) and by keeping the lubricant inside the bearing. 
In the assemblies with faulty sealing devices or devoid of sealing devices, different foreign bodies 
penetrate inside the bearing thus inducing an abrasive internal wear of the bearings or the corrosion of their 
active surfaces. 
The leakage of the lubricant from the bearing during its operation determines a useless consumption of 
lubricants and if the lubricant leak is not discovered in time, it may result a fast heating and/or bearing damage. 
The selection of the sealing system depends on the following factors, that feature the assembly 
operating conditions: 
a. bearing rotation speed;  
b. type of employed lubricant; 
c. lubricating system; 
d. assembly operating temperature; 
e. environmental conditions; 
f. constructive peculiarities of bearing assembly 
From a functional and constructive viewpoint, the sealing systems are as follows: 
 Stationary seals, between the stationary elements (housing and cover); 
 Rotary seals, between the rotating bearing elements; 
 Non-rubbing seals; 
 Rubbing seals. 
According to the working conditions, the environment in which the lubricated bearing operates, 
combined (special) sealing system can be used with both types of sealing at the same time. In their description 
we assume that the inner bearing ring rotates and the outer ring one is fixed.

is to be mounted, must be ensured their perfect contact on all circumferences of contact surfaces with the shaft 
(or housing) and bearing. 
Figure 3.1a illustrates the sealing with stationary spring washers (stationary shields) which are used for 
consistent greases, figure 3.1b illustrates the sealing with rotary spring washers (rotary shields) used for liquid 
lubricants used onto bearings by centrifugal forces. In the same time the shields laterally shake the dust particles 
and other impurities from them.  
Figure 3.2 presents two examples of bearings sealed with sealing washers type 2RS (2RSR) - figure 
3.2a, or shielded bearings with shields 2Z (2ZR) - fig 3.2b, which are delivered together with the entire required 
grease content for their life and can be successfully operate.

3.3.2. Rotary seals 

3.3.2.1. Non-rubbing seals 
This type of sealing is used for high temperature and speeds assemblies, their life being considered 
almost unlimited. There are the following types of rotary non-rubbing seals: gap seals, labyrinths and their 
combinations. 

3.3.2.1.1. 
Gap rotary non-rubbing seals 
They are used for assemblies less exposed to the danger of impurities and humidity penetration in the 
working space of the bearing.  
In simple cases there are enough the gap seals presented in figure 3.3a, which are mainly designed to 
retain grease into the bearing housing. The efficiency of sealing is conditioned by the gap length and by the 
clearance between shaft (or housing) and the sealing element. Sealing can be improved if on the shaft or in the 
housing there are one or more circular grooves which are to be filled with grease (see figure 3.3b), so the leak of 
grease is reduced and is stopped the penetration of impurities. 
In case of oil lubrication, the grooves on the shaft must be helical (figure 3.3c), and their direction must 
be the same with the direction of the shaft rotary movement. The allowable peripheral speed for this type of 
sealing is up to 5 m/s. During operation, the sealing grooves are maintained filled with clean, consistent and 
good quality grease. 

3.3.2.1.2. 
Labyrinth seals 
They are used at high peripheral speeds for the bearings that are functioning in environments with 
impurities, for example in dust or when the housing is water sprinkled. These are presented in figure 3.4.  
By increasing the number of gaps the efficiency grows very much. The gaps inside the labyrinths must 
be filled with a grease based on calcium or lithium soap to ensure the anticorrosive protection in the presence of 
water. In difficult cases it is recommended from time to time (2...3 times a week) to press in the gaps fresh 


20
grease to replace the dirty one or to complete the leakage. The labyrinths can be axially (a), radially (c), oriented 
or may have sloped steps (b). Sealing efficiency increases where both radial and axial labyrinths are used and 
the number of gaps is increased. 
Other types of seals may be executed according to figure 3.5 through joining iron sheet blades (figure 
3.5a) or processing the labyrinth walls with arc of circle form to avoid grease expulsion from the gaps in the 
housing in which the shaft is tilted (figure 3.5b).  
Also in order to avoid this phenomenon (which is frequent in the case of high speeds), the radial runout of the 
surfaces that make the gap must be minimum and their roughness must be Ra > 1.25 m. 

3.3.2.2.  Rubbing seals 
When selecting the proper rotary rubbing seal the following factors have to be considered: material and 
its elasticity (felt, rubber, plastic materials, leather, graphite, asbestos, metals etc.), resistance at different 
temperatures, maximum peripheral speed on sealing surface, sealing direction etc. 
The contact surfaces with ribbing seals must have a very small roughness especially when the peripheral 
speeds of the contact surfaces are very high.. It must be also assured a mounting that will not damage the sealing 
elements. 
Figures 3.6a and 3.6b illustrate sealing with single or double felt rings frequently used for grease or 
mineral oil lubrication; these are constructively simple, cheap and recommended mainly for peripheral speeds 
between 4 and 7 m/s (provided the contact surfaces are bright finished) and temperatures over +100oC, 
efficiently protect the bearing and prevent the leakage of the lubricant. 
Before mounting, felt ring is impregnated during an hour with a mixture of mineral oil (66%) and 
paraffin (33%) at a temperature of +70..+90oC, so that sealing is improved as the friction is reduced. The 
efficiency of felt sealing depends mainly on the felt quality (with long fibers). The use of low quality felt leads 
not only to its frequent replacement but can damage the bearing.  
Figures 3.6c and 3.6e, illustrates rubbing seals with a spring incorporated, which are made of synthetic 
rubber or special plastic materials and have, in most cases, a metallic hardening fixture. 
To maintain as long as possible a tightening force of the seal lip, around the felt ring is mounted a spiral 
spring. To press the seal in the housing it is recommended to use the press and to avoid the seal lip deterioration. 
Rubbing seals with a spring incorporated are most suitable to be used in case of oil lubricated bearings 
which are operated under peripheral speeds of 5..10 m/s and temperatures between -400C..+1200C. 
Lubricant outflow can be stopped by mounting the rubbing seal with incorporated spring with the edge 
inwards (figure 3.6c) or outwards (figure 3.6e) if sealing has to prevent dust or other impurities from penetrating 
into the bearing. 
Double sealing with these rubbing seals can also be used, improving thus the reliability and durability of 
the sealing. 
In figure 3.6e, and f, we are presenting V-rings sealing (figure 3.6f) for grease lubrication and 3.6e for 
oil lubrication). V-ring seals are used at temperatures of -40oC..+100oC, roughness of sealing surface being 
Ra=1,5 - 3 m. 
V-ring seals can also be used on the shaft subject to eccentric or angular (2 ...3)o movements. 
For peripheral speeds up to 15 m/s the V-ring seal operates as a rubbing seal and for peripheral speeds 
over 15 m/s the seal lip will lift from the sealing surface operating as a centrifugal sealing. 

To obtain superior sealing results, the above mentioned sealing are to be combined, example in figure 
3.7a and 3.7b, or other combined sealing, thus ensuring good sealing for any operating conditions of the 
bearings assemblies. 
The sealing systems for vertical shafts are not generally different from the systems used for horizontal 
shafts except lower bearings of the vertical shafts that require a special device to prevent lubricant leakage. 
The presented sealing systems does not represents all  the constructive  possibilities. 
The dimensions indicated for grooves and clearances at the labyrinth sealing (which have a great 
importance for the normal operation of the bearing) are recommended for the normal functioning temperatures.  
In case of significant temperature variations and for high axial loads acting on the bearing, these 
dimensions must be increased.

4. BEARINGS LUBRICATION 

4.1. Lubricant selection 
Liquid lubricants (mineral or synthetic oils), consistent lubricants (greases) or solid lubricants 
(graphite, molybdenum disulphide, teflon) are used in bearings lubrication.  
Liquid lubricants usually exhibit some advantages, that ensure their priority in lubrication system 
selection for the following reasons: they have a greater stability than the consistent ones, could be used for high 
and low rotation speeds and temperatures, provide the evacuation of the heat produced within the bearing, are 
less resistant to rolling elements motions (which allows their use for precise and sensible devices), allow the 
replacement of the lubricant without dismounting the assembly, have the possibility to dosage the lubricant. 
The main drawback of liquid lubrication is that the sealing housing is more difficult and requires a 
permanent check of the lubricant level.. 
The greases have the following advantages: a simple construction of the housing, safer and cheaper 
sealing, a better protection of bearings against external hazards and little danger of grease leakage than the 
liquid lubrication. 
The lubricant selection is conducted both on the basis of the analysis of the operation conditions and of 
the properties of the lubricant because there are no universal lubrication systems. At the lubricant selection and 
for establishing the relubrication intervals, the following factors are to be taken into account: 
 the size of the roller bearing 
 the loading of the roller bearing 
 the temperature of the roller bearing. 
Thus, in the table 4.1 there are given some examples for the selection of the lubricant and relubrication 
intervals taking into account the above mentioned influence factors. 
In order to solve by comparison the cases that there are not mentioned in the table above, the numbers 
mark the intervals for the factors that comply with the maintenance requirements and influence the lubricant 
selection. Conventional symbols in lubricants were also established: in case of oils, according to their viscosity 
and operating temperatures specified in table 4.2 and for greases according to their operating temperatures range 
and thickening agent (soap) specified in table 4.3 
The determinant factors in lubricants selection and the assigned symbols in table 4.1 are:  
a. The size of bearing - (outer diameter) – dimension D, in mm: 

1 - for bearings with D 22 mm 

2 - for bearings with 22< D  62 mm 

3 - for bearings with 62 < D  240 mm 

4 - for bearings with D> 240 mm 

The influence of bearing size on the lubricant selection, through the examples given in the table 4.1, can 
be summarized as follows: 
 for small roller bearings, especially at high rotation speeds, it is preferable that a low viscosity 
oil lubrication or a quality grease to reduce the friction; 
 for large size bearings, the value of the friction force can be neglected in regard  to heavy loads, 
so there can be used greater viscosity lubricants. 
b. The bearing rotation speed - n, in rpm: 

1 - for n 0,8 nlim 

2 - for n> 0,8 nlim , where: 

nlim represents the limit rotation speed of the bearing given in the catalogue. 
The value of the bearing rotation speed leads to a operation temperature increase. The greater the 
lubricant viscosity, the greater the value of the internal friction is. In the same time, the viscosity of the lubricant 
decreases with the increase of the bearing temperature. Irrespective of the viscosity value, the lubricating 
qualities must be preserved. 
Another lubricants and cooling system selection criterion, takes into account the product dmn 
[mmrpm], where dm represents the mean diameter of the bearing. According to the table 4.4 there could be 
considered six utilization domains. 
In case of very high rotation speeds that are exceeding nlim mentioned in the catalogue, oil lubrication is 
required to evacuate the heat. 
As a general conclusion, the increase of the rotation speed requires the decrease of the lubricant 
viscosity. In figure 2.4 there are presented recommendations for kinematic viscosity selection of the lubricant 
according to mean diameter (dm) and bearing rotation speed (n).

c. Bearing loading force, 𝑭𝑭, calculated with the relation: 
𝑭𝑭= 𝑿𝑿∙𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓+ 𝒀𝒀∙𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂, [𝑵𝑵] 
where:         𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓 is the radial load of the roller bearing, [N] 
𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂 is the axial load of the roller bearing, [N] 
𝑿𝑿, 𝒀𝒀, correction factors according to the load, axial or radial (values according to the catalogue). 
Thus, for the loading force are defined the following symbols:  
 normal loading force, if the ratio 𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪≤𝟎𝟎. 𝟏𝟏
 for 1, 2 and 3 width series and 𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪< 0.15
 for 
4 width series, where 𝑪𝑪 is the basic dynamic load rating of bearings according to the catalogue. 
 high loading force, if the ratio 𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪> 0.1
 for 1, 2 and 3 width series and 𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪< 0.15
 for 4 
width series.  
The influence of the load size (bearings loading force) for grease lubrication can be expressed by the 
ratio 𝒇𝒇∙(𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪
⁄ ) as shown in figure 4.1 plot. The 𝒇𝒇 factor is experimentally established and has the following 
values: 𝒇𝒇= 𝟏𝟏  for the ball bearings for any load and for the roller bearings when the radial load is 
predominantly, ((𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓
) ≤𝟏𝟏); 

 𝒇𝒇= 𝟐𝟐 for roller bearings when the axial load is predominantly, (𝑭𝑭𝒂𝒂𝑭𝑭𝒓𝒓
) > 1) 
In figure 4.1 the grease group is determined according to the load and rotation speed. The domain is considered 
to be divided in three fields as follows: 
 first field, I, delimited by  𝒇𝒇∙(𝑭𝑭𝑪𝑪
⁄ ) = 𝟎𝟎. 𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 and  𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍= 𝟏𝟏
. In the operating conditions 
that are according to this field may occur high temperatures and sometimes there are required 
high temperature greases;

 third field, III, corresponds to bearings subject to high speeds and low loads. To provide the 
formation of a lubricant film it is important that the internal friction of the lubricant and the 
friction between the bearing elements are reduced. To prevent the centrifugal disposal of the 
grease at high speed, these must have a good adhesion characteristic. A good behavior has the 
greases based on lithium soap, complex soaps or with organic synthetic thickeners, and 
synthetic low viscosity base oils. 
Also, for the mountings with sloped or vertical shafts, because of their own weight there is the danger 
for the grease to leave the roller bearing, mainly at high temperatures. Thus it is required the use of a good  
adhesion characteristic and high temperature greases. 
The significance of domains and curves of figure 4.2 plot is: 

1 - cylindrical roller bearings curve of radial loading; 
2 - the domain of the deep groove, tapered and self-aligning ball bearings (a-radial loads, b-axial loads);  
3 - the curve of the four-point contact bearings; 
4 - the domain of tapered roller bearings, self-aligning roller bearings (curve b-radial loads, curve caxial loads);

The bearing operating temperature is in most cases conditioned by the difference between the heat 
quantity produced during operation and the undesirable heat quantity carried away to other machine devices or 
under medium. The bearing operating temperature conditions the viscosity of the lubricant and imposes their 
features, because every lubricant has a temperature range in which this maintains its physical and chemical 
properties. (The operating temperature of a bearing is the temperature measured on the fixed ring). 

4.2.  Liquid lubricants  

4.2.1. Selection of liquid lubricants 
The sealing difficulties and lubricant leakage limit the applications of liquid lubrication to the 
applications where the stability and control of the lubricating film, reduced friction and cooling effects (heat 
evacuation through lubricant is determined by load, rotation speed and operating temperature) are important. 
Where the lubrication of bearings can be achieved in a common oil bath, liquid lubrication is recommended. 
Liquid lubricants for the bearings are both mineral and synthetic oils and mixtures of mineral and 
synthetic oils. The oils can be added with solid lubricants (molybdenum disulphide, graphite, teflon) or with 
other substances whose action manifests positively in improving the resistance of the lubricating film under high 
load, in avoiding the oxidation, the froth or viscosity decreasing at the increase of the temperature, etc. 
The oil viscosity is highly influenced by the temperature, decreasing at the increase of the temperature. 
The dependence of viscosity on temperature is evaluated by the viscosity index (IV), a higher value (IV>100) 
indicates a better stability of viscosity related to temperature. Table 4.6 presents the recommendations for the 
choice of oil viscosity at 50C according to the operating temperature of the bearings. 
The viscosity is also influenced by pressure which is important mainly in the case of bearings, and for 
that reason in the case of special applications with heavier loaded bearings it is necessary to choose the lubricant 
after a thorough analysis. 
The chart in figure 4.2 may be used to determinate the viscosity at 50C (in cSt). The upper diagram 
serves for determining the oil viscosity according to the bearing type, to the type of the load, and to the ratio 
n/nlim, where n represents the working rotation speed of the bearing and nlim represents the limit rotation speed 
for oil lubrication (values according to the catalogue). As a general rule, the viscosity must be greater for the 
axially loaded bearings than for the radially loaded  ones.  
The lower diagram is used to establish the oil viscosity (in cSt at 50C) according to the operating 
temperature, t [C], and viscosity.

4.2.2. Liquid lubricants circulating systems 

For the usual lubrication of bearings very low quantities of lubricant are necessary to reach the 
lubricating film. Considering the fact that the oil is required to act as coolant, it must be taken into account this 
requirement when determining the lubricant quantity. Heat evacuation from the bearing through the lubricant is 
more necessary when  load and rotation speed increases. 

The oil circulating systems, regarding the way in which bearing lubrication is assured are achieved 
through the following: oil bath lubrication; oil bath with external oil circulation;  jet lubrication; sprinkling by 
conveyance ring; oil driving by thrower ring; oil dropping; oil mist. 

The selection of a lubrication system may be also done according to the recommendations given in table 
4.7 that take into account the general working conditions and the product 𝒅𝒅𝒎𝒎∙𝒏𝒏.

4.3. Consistent lubricants (greases) 
4.3.1. Selection of consistent lubricants 
Except the direct use of the vegetal or animal fats as lubricants in very restrained applications, greases 
represent the usually consistent lubricant because of the simple housing construction, simplicity of the sealing 
and the relubrication facility. 

The greases are obtained as dispersed mixtures with plastic properties of some thickening agents as 
dispersed phase (soaps of the fatty acids of Na, Ca, Li, Pb etc or paraffin, bentonite, silica gel etc) in mineral or 
synthetic oils or in oleaginous fluids as dispersion environment (75 - 90 %). In grease composition may be 
introduced additives for high loads, corrosion avoiding or thermal stability. 
4.3.2. Lubricant quantity and relubrication intervals 
The amount of grease to be packed into the bearing at the beginning depends on the rotation speed. The 
bearing cavities should be filled with grease to capacity to ensure all the functional areas of the bearing are 
supplied with grease. The housing space should be filled as follows: 
 full at 𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍< 0.2
; 
 one third at 𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍= 𝟎𝟎. 𝟐𝟐… 𝟎𝟎. 𝟖𝟖
; 
 not at all at 𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍> 0.8
 where 𝒏𝒏 represents the working rotation speed and 𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍 represents 
the limit rotation speed recommended for greasing in the catalogue. 
The grease quantity required for the initial lubrication at the normal bearings can be calculated with the 
following relations:  

𝑮𝑮= 𝒅𝒅𝟐𝟐.𝟓𝟓𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗
, [𝒈𝒈], for 𝒅𝒅 in mm, at ball bearings; 

𝑮𝑮= 𝒅𝒅𝟑𝟑.𝟓𝟓𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑
, [𝒈𝒈], for 𝒅𝒅 in mm, at roller bearings, 
where: 𝒅𝒅 is bore diameter of bearing. 
At high rotation speeds of the shaft it is recommendable that, before introducing grease in bearing, this 
must be immersed in refined mineral oil of mean viscosity, then, after oil release, to be introduced the grease. 
In bearings with 𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍= 𝟎𝟎. 𝟐𝟐… 𝟎𝟎. 𝟖𝟖
 with horizontal axis it is indicated to fill only the lower half of 
the housing and the cover to remain empty. At vertical axis mountings in which the housing is made of two 
pieces is recommendable that both pieces are introduced into the grease but only to half of the free space. 
For low rotation speed bearings (𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒏𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍< 0.2
) that are operating in moisture and dusted environment, 
the free space of the housing must be fully filled to obtain a satisfactory sealing. 
Normally at the beginning of operation of a recently greased bearings, it may notice a temperature 
increase over the normal working temperature after which the temperature decreases and remains constant at a 
value of 10 - 50C over the environment temperature. The persistence of high values of temperature may be due 
to an excess of grease within the bearing, a too heavy load on the bearing or to misalignment of shafts. 

The relubrication intervals are established by practical observations and adequate recommendations or 
with experimentally established formulas such as: 
𝑻𝑻𝒖𝒖= 𝜶𝜶∙(𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏∙𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔
𝒏𝒏∙√𝒅𝒅
−𝟒𝟒∙𝒅𝒅) ∙𝒇𝒇𝟏𝟏∙𝒇𝒇𝟐𝟐∙𝒇𝒇𝟑𝟑 𝑻𝒖


29
BEARINGS. USER’S HANDBOOK.𝑻𝒖𝜶𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝒏𝒅𝟒𝟒𝒅𝒇𝟏𝒇𝟐𝒇𝟑
where: 
 𝑻𝑻𝒖𝒖 - relubrication interval or the grease life, in operation hours; 
 𝜶𝜶 -  coefficient depending on the bearing type (see table 4.8); 
 𝒏𝒏 - bearing rotation speed, rpm; 
 𝒅𝒅 - bore diameter of the bearing, in mm; 
 𝒇𝒇𝟏𝟏,𝒇𝒇𝟐𝟐,𝒇𝒇𝟑𝟑 - coefficients depending on the operating and environmental conditions (see tables 
4.9 and 4.10) 
The values resulting from calculus without 𝒇𝒇𝟏𝟏,𝒇𝒇𝟐𝟐,𝒇𝒇𝟑𝟑 correction coefficients are valid for working 
temperatures up to 70C. 

For temperatures above this value the relubrication interval decreases to a half, than the preceding 
period, for every 15C without exceeding the temperature limit for every type of grease. The relubrication 
interval is also reduced when there is not a good environmental condition for grease or in hard operating 
conditions. Where the grease has a sealing role against water penetration, (where the housing is frequently 
washed as for the paper processing machines) it is necessary to complete weekly the amount of grease. 
For the replenishment, the required quantity is given by the guide formula: 
𝑻𝑻𝒄𝒄= 𝑲𝑲𝒄𝒄∙𝑫𝑫∙𝑩𝑩, [𝒈𝒈] 
 where: 
 𝑫𝑫 - outer diameter, in mm; 
 𝑩𝑩 - roller bearing width, in mm; 
 𝑲𝑲𝒄𝒄 - coefficient (table 4.11) 
Replenishment must be done with the same type of grease or compatible ones to avoid the incompatible 
mixtures. 
4.3.3. Consistent lubricants feeding systems 

In an increasing no. of applications it is recommended the use of the greasing in bearings with 
protection devices (shields) or sealing devices (seals). 
In conditions of a controlled technological process, the greasing enhances the behavior and durability of 
bearings. The grease is filled into the cavities in a ratio of 30 - 50%, according to the minimum quantity required 
for greasing, but also to the heat produced in the bearing and its evacuation in the exterior. Usually in this 
conditions the greasing is done once for the entire life of the bearing, named “life-time" lubrication. 
For the rest of greased bearings constructions the best solution is given by the normal application of 
grease in the housing hollows (figure 4.12) in the above mentioned ratio. If the relubrication intervals are at least 
of 6 months, replenishment ducts or devices are not executed. Ribs may be executed on covers to reduce the 
grease rotation trend together with the shaft or bearing, or adequately dimensioned elements (adjusting washers) 
to prevent the filling of too much grease within the bearing (figure 4.13) 
The grease replenishment must be done with grease cups, greasing pump ("grease gun") to insert grease 
under pressure or grease pump to introduce grease in the centralized greasing systems.

5. BEARINGS STORAGE AND HANDLING 

Having in view the execution precision of bearings, an adequate storage, handling and a correctly 
executed mounting is required.  
The bearings must be stored in the original packing, in clean rooms, protected against dust and volatile 
corrosive substance intrusion. 
The relative humidity of the air inside the rooms must not exceed 60%, this being determined by means 
of a hygrometer and the optimal storage temperature is 18 - 20C (maximum 25c and minimum 15C). 

Staining in storage. 
 Improper stored bearing in humid atmosphere, with 
inadequate protection. 
Corrosion in storage.  
The corrosion takes place underneath the rollers 
 where moisture is trapped.  

Damage in transit 
 (vibration during shiping). 
(left - scuffed rollers, right - outer ring) 

Bearing handling between storage and mounting will be done carefully in order to protect the original 
pack and avoid its deterioration. Falls from heights and chokes will be avoided because the bearing steels are 
quite sensitive to chokes. 


31
In view of their storage, bearings will be stored on metallic or dry wood shelves (painted and covered 
with iron sheet) mounted at least 50 mm distance from the walls. It is not allowed to stack bearings so that they 
may come into contact with water, heating and air fan pipes with solar radiation or corrosive substances. 

It is not recommended to store bearings directly on the floor. 

The bearings unpacking must be done only at the beginning of the mounting operation. It is not allowed 
to handle them with wet hands because humidity and perspiration could determine corrosion phenomena. 

It is recommended the wear of protective gloves or handling the roller bearing with a clean and dry 
piece of cloth. 
6. MOUNTING OF BEARINGS  

6.1. The preparation of components for the mounting procedure 
Before mounting, all components must be verified according to the prescriptions at the dimensional, 
form precision and surface quality. 
The composite elements that are specific to a bearing assembly are: shafts, housings, axial fixing 
elements (adapter sleeves, shafts and housings, covers) and sealing element. 

6.1.1. The preparation of new bearings 
Bearings in their original packing are protected against corrosion and it is not necessary to remove the 
preserving substance (oil or grease) from them. 

Removing of the original packing will be done in the same day when the mounting of bearings is 
performed. 

6.1.2. The preparation of used bearings 
Bearings with damaged packing and bearings preserved more than 12 months will be washed and 
preserved again. 
For cleaning, the bearing will be introduced in a lamp oil bath, clean diesel fuel or white-spirit to 
remove the old preserving substance and the other impurities. 
During cleaning the rings must be rotated so that all surfaces are cleaned. After cleaning, the bearing 
must be immersed in another bath with white-spirit to rinse it and after that it will be dried suspended. Before 
rinsing, the aspect of the exterior surfaces of the bearing must be verified. If there are noticeable corrosion 
points with a surface less than 5 mm2 on the external surfaces of the outer ring and on the frontal surfaces of 
both rings, it is allowed to remove them by friction with sandpaper. 
It is strictly forbidden to effect this operation on the rolling sides of the bearing (race ways and rollers)! 
For the anticorrosive protection of relubricated bearings, the best method is to insert them in a technical 
Vaseline (petroleum jelly) bath at 50-60C or consistent grease heated at 70-90C. After the complete heating of 
bearings (recognized by the uniform layer of grease on them), they must be removed from the bath, dried and 
after cooling, they will be packed in plastic sheet or waxed paper and will be stored in cardboard boxes (for 
small and medium size bearings) or wrapped in textile band (large size bearings). 
The insertion and removal of bearings from the bath must be made with metallic hooks without 
touching the bearings bare-handed. 
The grease or the technical Vaseline could be replaced with bearings preservation products. 
To prevent the impurity contamination of greases bearings, the following directions must be respected: 
 the bowl in which the grease is preserved must be closed with a lid; 
 do not take out the grease with dirty hands or instruments. 
It is recommended the use of a metallic shovel which can be easily cleaned. 
In case the above mentioned directions are not respected, the premature damage of the bearings is 
facilitated. 

6.1.3. Shafts preparation for bearings mounting 
There are verified the mounting surfaces, including the frontal part of the shafts ribs which must be 
clean, smooth, without traces of impact, scores, corrosion etc. 
The presence of abrasive particles or metal chips makes the mounting procedure extremely difficult. 
If in spite of such shaft damage, a bearing is mounted on it, its position may be incorrect determining a 
decrease of its durability. If bearing is fixed in an axial location through a lock nut, it is necessary to screw up 
one time the lock nut to remove the bits that otherwise could reach the inner side of the bearing. 


32
Dimensional precision check according to the execution drawings is done by fixing the axis between the 
bottoms or in rests with the aid of a limit gauge or with the micrometer. It is necessary to check the shaft 
diameter with the micrometer in several points situated on the length of the shaft (figure 6.1). This allow the 
observation of the processing uniformity on the entire length and points out the tapering of the shaft. The ovality 
of the shaft must also be checked by means of a micrometer or limit gauge in a few planes and at least in three 
direction at 120 for every plan. To verify shape deviations in case of long dimension spindles a straight line 
with ink on it is used. The line is placed on the shaft in longitudinal direction and after that is moved back and 
forth. If the shaft is straight, on its surface is formed a continuous band of ink and if the spindle has surface 
deviations the ink band will be interrupted. 
To verify the small length taper shaft, a ring gauge covered with ink which allows shape deviation 
verification through the look of the ink deposits on the shaft surface is used. 
At diameters greater than 140 mm the ring gauges are replaced by special measuring devices. 
The lower dimensioned shafts must not be admitted in the mounting process because in this case the 
rotation of the inner ring is unsuitable. This phenomenon is accompanied by a fast increase of the bearing 
temperature determining its rapid destruction. Because of strong heating, the bearing will get dark and the 
surface of the shaft will be destroyed. This procedure must not be applied because the securing of the interior 
ring of the bearing against axial displacements does not exclude the danger of ring rotation on the shaft. 
Neither over-dimensioned shafts must be admitted in mounting because of the dilatation of the inner 
ring leading to the disappearance of the radial clearance required in exploitation. If the clearance between the 
rings is reduced, the rollers or the balls will be blocked. Such a bearing will have a slow motion, it will be very 
heated and will be destroyed soon. 
Thus, it is important to choose correctly and to respect the tolerance fields for shafts and the tolerances 
for form and position deviations. 
For a normal functioning in bearings, especially in case of high axial efforts and high rotation speeds it 
is very important that the shaft ribs and connections be correctly designed and executed with maximum 
precision. 
The frontal part of ribs must not have scratches of impact signs and damage because the ring of the 
bearing must adhere uniformly to the entire frontal surface. The shaft rib must be normal on the spindle axis. 
The check of rib perpendicular alignment normality may be done with the gauge through shaft securing 
between its two sides. 
If the ribs are not perpendicular alignment on the surfaces and shaft axis, these are determining 
additional stresses on the bearing even in the absence of the external loads. 
The processing conditions required to the ribs are important for the bearings when the cylindrical roller 
is axially loaded or when the exterior ring must be pressed onto the housing. 
In figure 6.2 it is illustrated an exaggerated case of deformation of the cylindrical roller bearing inner 
ring because of the incorrect processing of the rib shaft. 
The shafts with tapered ribs will be rejected from mounting because in this case only the exterior or the 
interior side of the bearing can touch the frontal surface of the rib after the bearing mounting as illustrated in 
figure 6.3. and 6.4 Under high load, the rib will rapidly deform itself and the bearing will not be tight between 
the lock nut and the shaft rib. 
The surfaces of the shaft in contact with the bearing will have the roughness Ra according to table 3.5. 
When moved inside the workshops, the shafts will be protected with sleeves. The shafts prepared for 
utilization and from several reasons are to be kept stored for more time must be protected with a technical 
Vaseline or grease layer and then will be packed in waterproof paper. 

6.1.4. The preparation of housing 
Generally, the above mentioned hints for shaft preparation are valid for the housings and for any other 
pieces which are part of a bearing assembly. 
The inside part of the housings is measured with fixed gauges or interior micrometers. The interior 
surfaces will be examined to be smooth, clean, without impurities, burrs without cracks, scores etc. The outer 
ring of the bearing mounted in its seat must be uniformly in contact on all its circumference which is possible 
only when the boring is precisely processed. 
In case of two-piece housings it will be verified the finishing degree of the contact surfaces of the two 
pieces to secure a good adherence eliminating any clearance between them. 
The scaling check of the two contact surfaces will be done with the thickness gauge which must not 
cross nowhere along the contact surface of the two halves. 


33
Form (cylindrical, taper) deviation check will be done according to figure 6.5 through measurements 
effected in several planes and positions (1, 2, 3, 4) in at least 3 places on the circumference (diameters AA, BB, 
CC, DD), by turning the micrometer with 120. 
Alignment and parallelism of the half housings against their side surfaces can be verified through 
measurement of the thicknesses L1 and L2. 
The correct geometrical form of the housings (even the one of the two pieces housings) is checked with 
gauges of adequate dimensions. These ones after their painting on the cylindrical surface are pressed onto the 
surface of the boring and rotated several times in both ways.  
The surface of the housing bore is considered to be good if the paint tracks cover at least 75% of the 
surface. The surface of the housing bore will have a roughness Ra according to the table 3.5.  

Figure 6.1 
Figure 6.2 
Figure 6.3 

Figure 6.4 
Figure 6.5 

6.1.5. The preparation for the mounting of the axial fixing elements 
Usually, the axial mounting of the inner rings is done through supporting sleeves and covers or axial 
lock nuts, mounted on the frontal surfaces of the shafts. 
At the axial fixing elements there are not accepted the following surface defects: 
 local wears 
 cracks and pinches 
 sticking marks 
 inclusions 
The supporting sleeves are to be verified with the aid of the micrometer gauge. 
The shape deviations of the axial fixing elements must be chosen in the same precision class with the 
one of the assembled bearings. 
The measures taken both on the shafts, housings and fixing elements will be done in clean rooms at an 
mean temperature of 20C and a relative humidity of 55%. 


34
Before measuring the devices, the micrometer gauges and precision gauge devices will be introduced in 
the room waiting four hours to get them to the temperature inside. 
The measuring devices and gauges will be carefully kept in their cases, in clean rooms, dust free and 
will be kept away from chokes and vibrations. 
With the “go” and “not-go” gauge will be checked the inner and the outer threads, the chamfers and 
grooves. 

The non-observance of the requirements regarding the bearings mounting and dismounting in view of 
their maintenance often leads to important prejudices that may compromise assemblies perfectly designed from 
the technical point of view. 

The diversity of bearings type dimensions and their operation conditions (load, rotation speed, 
temperature) require different methods for their mounting and dismounting with adequate tools and devices. 

The basic idea in conceiving any bearings mounting device is that the exterior forces applied to the 
bearing when pressing must not be transmitted through the rolling elements. If this principle is not observed, 
because of the pressing forces, impressions could appear on the bearings raceways that will make it unusable 
after a certain running time. 

The devices must be as simple as possible constructively and secure a uniform and symmetrical 
disposition of the pressing forces on the contact surfaces. They must be comfortable and ensure a raised 
productivity in the mounting process. 

6.2.2. Mounting of bearings with cylindrical bore 
Mounting of bearings in housings and shafts fitted with interference fit is done by means of mechanical, 
thermal or hydraulic devices. 
The pressing force must be transmitted only through the ring that causes with the shaft or the housing 
the interference fit avoiding its transmission through the rolling elements. 
In small size bearings, mounting (bore diameter less than 50 mm) with intermediate fits or with 
interference fit in housing and/or shaft are used special sleeves with one or two ribs on which there are applied 
smooth strokes with a hammer. The use of sleeves guarantees the uniform distribution of force (figures 6.6, 6.7) 
In order to ensure a progressive and continuous application of the pressing force, mechanical presses or 
hydraulic presses. If a non-separable bearing must be mounted in the same time on the shaft and in the housing, 
between the bearing and the mounting sleeve a plate is inserted to transmit uniformly the force on the frontal 
faces of the rings. If both bearing rings must form interference fittings, a sleeve whose front surface, in the 
shape of two circular rims, lies simultaneously both on the inner and the outer rings, is used (figure 6.7). 
In the case of dismounting bearings, the rings could be mounted separately on the shaft, respective in 
the housing, which is favorable mainly when interference fits for both rings are practiced. The medium size 
bearings (with the bore diameter between 50 and 100 mm) and large size ones (with the bore diameter between 
100 and 200 mm) cannot be cold pressed on the shaft or in the housing due to the increase of pressing forces 
with the bearing size increase. Thus, the non-separable bearings or the inner rings of the separable bearings are 
heated before mounting. If a non-separable bearing must be simultaneous mounted on the shaft and in housing, 
then it is inserted between bearing and sleeves, a supporting plate to evenly disperse the pressing force (figure 
6.8). The temperature difference, required between the bearing ring and the interlinked part, depends on the 
fitting and the size of the bearing. 
6.2. Bearing mounting devices 
6.2.1. Generalities 
The operational safety of bearings depends highly on their correct mounting and dismounting on the 
operation site. 

              Bearings must not be heated over 110C in order not to cause alterations within the internal 
structure of steel thus, resulting in dimensional variations and decrease of their hardness. 
At the determination of the heating temperature must be taken into account the distance between the 
heating source and the mounting places since bearing cooling takes place during transportation. Local 
overheating must be avoided. The protected bearings or sealed bearings (2Z and 2RS) are not heated before 
mounting. 
Oil baths, heating housings or electrical heating plate are used in bearings heating. In case of bath 
heating an anticorrosive oil is used, with low viscosity which easily leaks from the bearing when it is rotated 
upon removing from bath. An example of heating environment is the transformer oil. 


35
As it can be seen in figure 6.9, the bowl is seated on an electrical heating plate. The oil temperature is 
checked with a thermometer, but it is preferred an automatic adjustment of temperature. The bath is fitted with a 
grill (situated at 60 - 70 cm from the bottom) to prevent the bearing from coming in direct contact with the 
heating plate and the possible impurities in the bath from entering the bearing at the same time. The oil must 
cover completely the bearing. 
The bearings heated on the electrical plate must be turned several times for a uniform heating and to 
avoid local overheating. The heating time of the bearing is of 30 - 50 min, according to the bearing dimensions. 
The temperature of the electric heating plate must be adjusted with a thermostat. 
To obtain an enhanced productivity in case of a series production, other devices and heating equipment 
can be used (ex: the inner rings of the cylindrical bearings type NU, NJ and NUP can be heated before mounting 
with extraction electric devices or with a thermal dismounting ring as in figure 6.10, or with a dismounting 
thermal-ring figure-6.11). 
The medium size and large size bearings could be mounted through the induction heating devices. These are, 
first of all, heated to a temperature greater than the room temperature by around 80C. 
The induction heating devices contain a coil inductor and a power group fitted with several voltage 
steps, time relays and thermal protection relays for ring heating. The separable inner ring of the bearing inserted 
into the inductor bore and kept there for a short time (about 80 sec) is heated through Foucault currents 
formation. 
After heating, the demagnetized rings in the same device are removed and mounted on the shaft.

Figure 6.9 

Figure 6.10 
Figure 6.11 
induction heating devices 
6.2.3. Mounting of cylindrical roller bearings  
Mounting of the inner ring or of the outer ring into the assembly must not be done in force. If there is a 
considerable resistance, the ring with the rollers must be alternatively rotated during mounting (figure 6.12). To 
facilitate the mounting and avoid the bearing damage, the use of specially constructed auxiliary rings is 
recommended (figure 6.13 and 6.14).   
After the mounting of cylindrical bearing (type N or NU), the axial displacement of a ring against the other must 
be measured and checked. 
6.2.4.  Mounting of tapered bore bearings  
 The tapered bore bearings could be mounted directly on shafts, adapter sleeves or withdrawal sleeves. 
The mounting of these bearings is done only with interference fit. 
In table 6.1 are given for the self-aligning spherical roller bearings the values of the radial clearance 
reduction after mounting according to the initial clearance.   
The small size tapered bore bearings mounted directly on the shaft, adapter sleeve or withdrawal sleeve 
after fixing on the tapered shaft are axially displaced through some lock nuts type KM and washers type MB, 
(figure 6.16 a, b, c). The medium size bearings are axially displaced using a special nut (figure 6.17) with 


36

several screws which is afterwards dismounted and replaced with an axial lock nut. 
In medium and large size bearings special mounting hydraulic presses (figure 6.18) or special hydraulic 
nuts are used, for example in figure 6.19 a. (The mounting of a tapered bore bearing directly on the tapered 
shaft), figure 6.19 b (the mounting of a bearing with adapter sleeve), figure 6.19 c (the mounting of a bearing 
with withdrawal sleeve).

6.3. Performance test  
Test starting must be done after the following verifications have been carried out: 
a. tightening screws and nuts; 
b. checking the radial clearance of the bearing; 
c. hand rotation test of bearings (if the assembly allow this test). 
Attention! These two verifications (b and c) must also be performed before bearing mounting, so: 
b. Check the radial clearance of bearings using thickness gauges which are inserted: 
 between the rollers and the raceway of the outer ring at the upper part for the spherical bearings; 
 between the rollers and raceway of the inner ring at the lower part for bearings type NU, NJ; 
 between the rollers and the raceway of the outer ring at the lower part for type N bearings. 

Note: In case of deep groove ball bearings the clearance cannot be checked after mounting and before 
mounting, this operation requires the existence of a special device.

c. At the hand rotation test, it must be checked if bearings are easily rotating without interruptions, 
with low and uniform noise. Before the rotation test, a few drops of transformer oil could be 
inserted in the bearing to avoid dry friction. If the hand rotation is normal, the sealing is further 
checked, the required quantity of lubricant is inserted and after that the operation test is performed. 
During the latter, the assembly must be verified mainly regarding the noise and easy rotation. 


38

The noise check during operation should be carried out by a specialized worker who is supposed to 
listen to the bearing noise, a worker capable to make difference between the noise produced by the bearing and 
the noise of the other moving parts of the machine. 
This check can be done with an acoustic tube, long hilted screwdriver. 
A correct mounted bearing must operate uniformly, without shocks and unusual noise. A dump 
interrupted noise shows that the bearing is dirty and a “whistling” sound indicates that the bearing is not enough 
lubricated or there are frictions between the bearing and its connection pieces. 
In both cases it is necessary to stop the test to verify the bearing mounting and its state. 
During the performance test the bearing temperature must be frequently verified. Under normal 
conditions this must not exceed with more than 20 - 30C the temperature of the environment. 
There are not allowed temperatures over 80C. 
In the first moments of the test, because of the friction between the sealing and the shaft, a sudden 
increase of the temperature above normal values may occur, but in a certain period of operation this increase is 
stabilized. 
If the increase of the temperature has a pronounced and continuous character, the test must be 
interrupted to find the reasons for which the bearing heated. 
In case in that at the assembly dismounting there are no faulty bearing or adjacent parts and the aspect 
of the pieces is normal, the correct selection of the bearing for the operating conditions must be checked. 
We recommend a minimal loading (Fr min) in bearing assembly test functioning, mainly in case of high 
rotation speeds such as: 
Fr min=0.01xCr - for radial ball bearings; 
Fr min=0.02xCr - for radial roller bearings; 
Fr min=0.04xCr - for full complement bearings. 
where: 
 𝑪𝑪𝒓𝒓 = basic dynamic load taken from the bearing catalogue. 

This is necessary in diminishing the effect of inertial forces which cause sliding effects between the 
raceway and elements with a negative influence upon the operating conditions (additional friction, temperature 
increase). 

The performance test with the loaded bearings as in the operating conditions will allow to notice the 
possible faults and to remove them thus ensuring a good running of the assembly.

7. DISMOUNTING OF BEARINGS 

7.1. Rules in bearings dismounting  
Bearings dismounting imply the same measures described in the above section (Bearing Mounting). 
Many users do not pay special attention to this operation, they don’t know and don’t apply dismounting 
methods. 

The reasons that determine the necessity of roller bearings dismounting are different, such as: 
 faulty mounting; 
 regular wear of bearings; 
 complete damage; 
 device repair and general repair of bearings; 

Dismounting kit 
Wrong 
Right 

Figure 7.1 
Figure 7.2 

Figure 7.3 
Figure 7.4 

Thus, bearing dismounting must be done carefully during its taking out even from the shaft and from the 
housing. The same attention must be paid to non-operable bearing, whose inspection is useful to determine the 
causes of damage. 
If the bearing is completely damaged, precaution measures at its taking out are pointless, in this case the 
dismounting method must exclude the possibility of damaging the surrounding parts or affecting the 
exploitation qualities of the machine in running, device etc. 


40
The problem of ensuring cleanliness conditions of the dismounted bearings must be considered 
differently according to their situation. 
When dismounting a damaged bearing, it is not necessary to observe the maintenance - washing rules, if 
the user dismounts good bearings or bearings for inspection cleanliness is essential. 
Before bearing dismounting, it is recommended to take all the necessary measures to ensure cleanliness 
at work site. In bearing dismounting, the worker wear gloves and use clean tools. 
If the bearing functioned and there are reasons to suppose that impurities penetrated inside it, it is 
necessary that immediately after dismounting the bearing must be washed by the methods presented. 
7.2. Bearing dismounting devices 
Bearings dismounting from housings and shafts is done with specific means according to the fitting 
type, bearing type and size, necessity of further using the respective bearing, housing or shafts. 

There could be distinguished two main categories during the dismounting operations: 
1. Cylindrical bore bearing dismounting; 
2. Taper bore bearing dismounting. 
The dismounting of bearings from housings and shafts with interference fit is carried out by mechanical, 
thermal or hydraulic means in reversed order than the mounting operations, dismounting first the elements less 
tightened. 
The extraction force must be transmitted only through the ring in contact with the shaft or the housing 
of the interference fit, avoiding its transmission through the rolling elements. 
7.2.1. Dismounting of bearings with cylindrical bore 
For the small dimension bearing (bore smaller than 50 mm) from the separable or non-separable 
bearings category, tightening mounted, the extraction is done using a soft steel or copper mandrel with rounded 
edges and a hammer through which are applied strokes on the inner ring on its side face with the aid of the 
mandrel along the circumference of the ring. It must have care not to touch the shaft or the inner of the bearing, 
the strokes being able to determine irreparable damages. 
If it is not required the further use of the roller bearing, its dismounting may be done using a mechanical 
press, figure 7.1 and figure 7.2, or the specific construction of the shaft, figure 7.3. The best extraction mode is 
presented in figure 7.4 when it is used a small capacity mechanical or hydraulic press, the shaft with the bearing 
being able to be moved in its working zone. 

Figure 7.7 

Figure 7.5 
Figure 7.6 
Figure 7.8 


41
The elements used for dismounting are made on dimensional ranges. 
If the shafts with the bearings cannot be moved, there are used two or three arms mechanical presses 
(figure 7.5 and 7.6). These are adjustable tools allowing a great range of dimensions.  
In the case of medium and large size bearings it is recommendable the use of the oil injection method, 
figure 7.7, or 7.8, which develops great extraction forces. Through this method it is followed the creation of a oil 
film between the shaft and the inner ring facilitating thus the slide. In the case of dismounting after a long 
operation period in improper lubrication conditions which allowed oxidation between the contact surfaces, to 
prevent their deterioration it is recommended the use of a oil with antioxidant additives.   
Medium and large size bearings and rings serial dismounting from the shafts is greatly facilitated using 
the thermal means. 
The bearing or the separable inner ring is heated up to 80 - 100C so that through dilatation it must be 
easily removed from the shaft. 
There are several heating modalities depending on the repeatability of the dismounting operation and to 
the dimensions of the dismounting element. 

Figure 7.9 
Figure 7.10 
Figure 7.11 
Figure 7.12 

Figure 7.12 
Figure 7.12 
Figure 7.12 

Thus, the heating may be done: 
a. in mineral oil baths having the temperature of 80 - 100C so that there are heated only the ring 
or the bearing protecting the rest of the shaft with asbestos or cardboard. The extraction is done 
by mechanical devices. 
b. for the rings with medium and large dimensions, it is simple to use an aluminum made extractor 
ring (see figure 6.11 heated on the electrical heating plate or through induction up to about 220
C after which the ring  to be dismounted is inserted and tightened with the two joined rings. 

After about 20 - 30 seconds the ring dilates enough to allow its easy extraction. To protect the raceways, the ring is smeared with silicone oil (which is resistant to oxidation). 


42
7.2.2. Dismounting of tapper bore bearings 
The dismounting of the small tapper bore bearings mounted directly on the shaft is achieved through the 
application of the tool (mandrel, pipe, half ring) directly on the side face of the inner ring and after that with 
gently strokes dismounting is produced. 
In case of small bearings mounted on sleeves there must be opened first the lock washer and after that 
unscrew few turns, the lock nut.  
The tool, which can be a tool or a mandrel (figure 7.9) or an intermediary half ring (figure 7.10) is 
placed in position and then, with strokes uniformly distributed on the entire circumference, the bearing is 
dismounted. 
The withdrawal sleeve could be also dismounted mechanically. To this purpose it can be used the nut 
axially fastened after removing the shaft’s nut and lock washer (figure 7.11) by tightening the nut with the 
special wrench till the bush extraction. 
The greater are the dimensions of the roller bearings (boring greater than 100 mm) the greater must be 
the dismounting forces. 
In this case it is used the method of oil injection between the mounting surfaces or the hydraulic nuts. 
Oil injection could be applied in the case of the bearings directly mounted on the shaft through the 
special provided grooves.          
Oil injection procedure is also applied to the bearings mounted on the adapter sleeve or withdrawal 
sleeves (figure 7.12 and figure 7.13) which have provided grooves for this purpose. 
The decrease of the physical effort and dismounting time are achieved by the use of the hydraulic nuts 
which are used both for removing from the withdrawal sleeves (figure 7.14) and for removing from the adapter 
sleeve (figure 7.15). 
Insertion of pressurized oil into the hydraulic nuts is done with the aid of the manual presses. The oil 
injection method may be combined with the use of the hydraulic nut in case of large size bearings or for 
blocking them on the shaft. 
8. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE OF BEARINGS 

The inspection of the devices and equipment containing bearings during operation and their scheduling 
for the reliable maintenance practices, became an usual and very important practice. So, even we can determine 
the bearings life, the operating conditions are the ones that decide their lifetime in the assembly where mounted. 
The heavier are the operating conditions, more frequent will be the interventions at the bearings assemblies, 
with direct implications on the costs. Thus, the condition monitoring of the bearings and of the other pieces of 
the assembly, could give important information about the bearing damages, allowing scheduling a current 
replacement before total destruction. In such a manner there are avoided the unscheduled downtime, often 
dangerous, through scheduled stoppages for revision and maintenance. The frequency of the bearing operation 
check depends on the importance of the machinery where this is mounted, and on environmental conditions in 
which the bearing operates. 
If there is no permanent surveying system for the bearings (monitoring system), the surveillance is 
based on the individual senses of the maintenance staff. Vibration, noise, temperature increase, lubricant leakage 
are alarm signals that require a thorough verification of the bearings. 
The first verifications on the bearings are that one’s effected during the performance test.   

Notice: A bearing assembly must not be rotated without load  or lubrication! 

The noise check during operation is done with the aid of the dedicated instruments like shock - pulse 
meter or by listening with a stethoscope, acoustic tube or wooden stick. It must be continuous and even. The 
irregularities of the noise (grinding sound) or its transformation into a sharp whistle are signs of certain damages 
caused by the penetration of dirt into the bearing or because of the lubricant lack, or because of erroneous 
processed or mounted pieces in the assembly. 
The temperature variation check is done with thermometers or thermocouples and is mentioned in 
diagrams. The bearings are considered good when the temperature increase is continuous and even, attaining the 
maximum allowable temperature after a period of time which varies according to the type and size of the 
bearing. The sudden increase of the temperature indicates a leak in the lubrication system, impurities in the 
lubricant, a wrong selection of the lubricant, an incorrect mounting, overloading or insufficient clearance. 
The first verification of the bearings during operation is the visual control of the housing to verify the 
sealing state, the joints and assemblies and lubrication systems state. 


43
There must be verified:  - not to exist sealing defects, manifesting through lubricant leakage; - not to 
exist lubricant leakage at the sub-assemblies joints; - the existence and status of the lubricating systems, which 
require periodical cleaning; - the level of the lubricant in the bearing, housing or in the centralized lubrication 
system, the functioning of the lubricant feeder; - the aspect and the quality of the lubricant (samples of lubricant 
are taken from the bearing and are compared with the same type of unused lubricant); - the existence of paint 
discoloration (or of the thermal marks) on the bearing (may point out the excessive increase of the operation 
temperature). 
The verification of the lubricant may give the following information: - the discoloration means the 
beginning of the aging, mainly when it is less viscid than the sample of unused lubricant; - the dirty color shows 
contamination of the lubricant with metallic particles from the wear of the housing parts, or with nonmetallic 
particles from deterioration of the sealing systems; - the limy oil shows water presence. 
In all the cases it is recommended to replace the lubricant with the recommended oil or its equivalent. 
The maintenance of the greased bearings functionality requires the observance of the recommendations 
regarding the greasing points, relubrication intervals, the quality of the grease - the recommended grease or its 
equivalent, cleanliness maintenance of the grease feeding system. 
Another check refers to the noise of the bearings during operation. An even and continuous noise 
indicates a good running of the bearings. Intermittent noise, powerful or accompanied with noises type “strike - 
knock”, shows the bearing damage requiring bearing inspection and/or replacement. It is required the check of 
the lubricating system and of the lubricant because the main reasons of the premature damage of the bearings 
are the malfunctions due to incorrect lubrication, poor lubrication or lubricant contamination. 
The operation temperature check has in view its sudden increases and the raised, long time persisting 
values (except in the case of new lubricated or relubricated bearings which presents a natural temperature rise 
for the first 24 - 48 operating hours). If the loading conditions were not modified, among the reasons for the 
temperature rise may be a lubricant leakage or an exaggerate increase of the lubricant quantity in the bearing. 

9. BEARINGS EXAMINATION. FAILURE REASONS 

Normally, if the bearing mounting was correctly done and its operation is designed for the specified 
loads, speeds and temperatures, with an adequate lubrication, it is assumed that the bearing damage is produced 
by material fatigue (pitting). If the operation of such a bearing is not interrupted, the peeling will increase 
rapidly leading to the out of function of the roller bearing with possible damages to the entire assembly. 
In the most frequent situations damage occurs from the following reasons: 
 faulty mounting of the bearing or of the assembly surrounding parts; 
 deviations from the correct geometrical form of the mounting surfaces and non-observance of 
the tolerances for shaft and housing diameters; 
 non coaxially between shaft and housing; 
 bearing operation in improper conditions (loads, speeds, temperatures); 
 poor lubrication 
 inadequate sealing 
 inadequate lubricant for the respective application 
 flowing of the electric current through the roller bearing. 
Usually, the symptoms of bearings damage allow to find out the malfunction reasons and even their 
removal to ensure a further normal function of the bearing. 
Below there are given some examples regarding the most frequent roller bearings damages. 
Usually the roller bearings will be replaced if they are presenting the following effects: signs of 
corrosion on the operating surfaces of the bearing elements and at the inner ring bore; signs of mechanical or 
electrical pitting; scratches; cracks; pinches; spalling or material losses; deformed or broken rivets; cracked 
cages; surfaces with a beginning of coloration in yellow, blue, gray or red; imprints, strikes or welding material 
on the raceways and rolling elements. 
The replacement of the roller bearing is recommended as soon as the early manifestations of micro 
scrapes and peeling pointed out, by the increase of the operation clearance, noises and vibrations during the 
operation of the bearing. Usually, the scratching of the working surfaces requires the replacement of the bearing 
because of noise, uneven rotation or bearing blockage. 
The poor lubrication inevitably leads to the sudden increase of the friction and overheating of the 
affected surfaces. The interruption of the lubricant film between the relative motions surfaces under high load 
and speed conditions, leads to plastic micro deformations and micro welding (appears the loss of the luster and 
stain on the contact surfaces). 


44

Apparition of pitting (flaking) on the raceway of the inner 
ring.. 
This wear is of adhesive type and has a fast evolution towards material breaks and finally the bearing 
locking with serious consequences for the entire assembly. 
The operation of the bearing in a moist environment or its contamination with water, acid or alkaline 
substances, leads to the occurrence of the chemical phenomena at the level of the metallic surfaces, corroding 
them. 
The contact corrosion appears in the stationary vibrating or slightly oscillating bearings, on the sliding 
contacts (rollers ends) and on the rolling contact surfaces manifesting through small brown reddish particles 
detachment. This type of wear evolve through the increase of the clearance, vibrations and noise, with direct 
effect on the decrease of the bearing life.  
The relative motions of the rings on the shaft or in the housing, due to the use of an inadequate fit or by 
a faulty execution of the mounting surfaces determine the occurrence of the wear by contact corrosion.  
The deterioration of the bearings due to the stationary vibrations resembles as concerns the aspect 
(crossing tracks on the raceways and on the rolling elements) with the damage determined by the pass of the 
electric current (electrical pitting). For the occurrence of this type of damage it is enough a voltage of 0,5V to 
determine a melting temperature in the contact points between the rollers and the rings. 
To avoid the occurrence of the two flaws it is recommended: 
 to remove the load during bearing stands, or to strain the  shaft in axial direction to avoid 
vibrations; 
 to deviate the electric current beside the bearing. 
The detection of the flaws presents a special interest for preventing a dangerous further evolution of the 
flaw with influences over the whole assembly, or machine. 
The visual inspection with a certain efficiency in diagnose of faults, requires the dismounting of  
bearing. 
Defects, Causes and Countermeasures 

Flaking. Rolling contact fatigue, caused by 
the repeated stresses developed in the contacts 
between the rolling elements and the 
raceways, is described as fatigue. Fatigue is 
manifested visibly as a flaking of particles 
material from the surface.  
Pitting: small holes 0.1 mm in depth are 
generated on the raceway surface by rolling 
fatigue. 

Subsurface initiated material fatigue. The 
cumulation of load cycles leads to structural 
changes and fatigue cracks, originating in the 
loaded zone. 
Faulty 
mounting 
and/or 
handling 
has 
produced raceway indentations, spaced at 
rolling element pitch. Subsequent over-rolling 
leading to flaking. 
Misalignment 
during 
operation; 
shaft 
deflection; abutment faces on mating part(s) 
out-of-square. 
Excessive axial load on a bearing can cause 
premature fatigue and flaking over the entire 
circumference of one of the raceways. 

Flaking equally spaced at the rollers pitch on the inner ring. 
Specific to vibration occurrence during running. 

Pitting (Flaking) on the surface of the inner ring raceway. 
Specific after wrong mounting procedure 


45

Use a bearing with higher load-carrying 
capacity if longer life is required. 
Mount bearing correctly using suitable tools. 
Do not transmit mounting forces through 
rolling 
elements. 
For 
cylindrical 
roller 
bearings, rotate shaft / housing slowly during 
mounting, if possible. 
Check if bearing type is suitable for the 
equipment.  
Eliminate misalignment or select a bearing 
type 
suitable 
to 
accommodate 
the 
misalignment.  
Reduce shaft deflection.  
Check the squareness of the abutment faces on 
mating part(s). 
If appropriate, select a bearing with higher 
axial  load-carrying capacity.  
Control axial load on the bearing.   

Apparition of pitting (flaking) on the raceway of the inner 
ring.. 

Uneven exfoliation on raceway. Specific to  improper 
position mounting  (axially) or axially overloading. 

Even exfoliation on loaded area. Normal wear pattern.

Smearing (skidding)  

Incorrect 
design 
and/or 
operation. 
Smearing (skidding) appears between 
rolling elements and raceways, in a
