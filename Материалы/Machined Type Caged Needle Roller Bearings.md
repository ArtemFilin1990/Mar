●Machined Type Caged Needle Roller Bearings
●Machined Type Guide Needle Roller Bearings
■Structure and Features
IKO Machined Type Needle Roller Bearings are bearings with a low sectional height and large load ratings. 
The outer ring has high rigidity and can easily be used 
even for light alloy housings.  These bearings are 
available in metric series and inch series, both of 
which have the caged type and the full complement 
type.  It is therefore possible to select a suitable bearing for use under various conditions such as heavy 
loads and high-speed or low-speed rotations.  In addition, there are bearings with and without an inner ring. 
As the type without inner ring uses a shaft as the 
raceway surface, a compact design is possible.

■Types
Machined Type Needle Roller Bearings are available 
in various types shown in Table 1.
Caged Needle Roller Bearings
This type of bearing combines a collared outer ring 
with the IKO's unique lightweight rigid cage and needle rollers.  During operation, needle rollers are guided precisely by the cage, and an ideal load distribution is obtained.
The metric series consists of the NA48 and NA49 
series of ISO Standard, NA69 and TAFI series which 
are based on the international dimension series, and 
the heavy duty TRI series which is widely used in 
Japan.  The TAFI series has a sectional height as low 
as that of the shell type and is used for light loads.
The inch series or BRI series is based on the specifications of ANSI Standard of USA.
Caged Needle Roller Bearings without Inner Ring 
As shown in the section "Design of shaft and housing" 
on page A44, any desired radial clearance can be 
selected by assembling this type of bearing with a 
shaft which is heat-treated and finished by grinding.
These bearings are free from the effects on dimensional accuracy caused by assembling an inner ring, 
so that the rotational accuracy is improved. Also, the 
shaft rigidity can be improved as the shaft diameter 
can be increased by an amount corresponding to the 
inner ring thickness.
Caged Needle Roller Bearings with Inner Ring
This type of bearing is used when the shaft cannot be 
heat-treated and finished by grinding.  The outer and 
inner rings are separable and a small relief clearance 
is provided on both sides of the inner ring raceway to 
facilitate bearing mounting.  In the TRI and BRI 
series, the width of the inner ring is larger than that of 
the outer ring.
Due to heat expansion during operation or mounting 
errors, the inner or outer ring may be shifted axially 
and the whole length of the rollers may not be in contact with the raceway.  Therefore, attention should be 
paid to the allowable axial shift S as shown in the 
table of dimensions.
Needle Roller Bearings with Seal
These bearings are sealed types of the NA49, NA69 
and BRI series bearings, in which a seal is installed 
on one side (type with one seal) or both sides (type 
with two seals) of the bearing.  The seal is made of 
special synthetic rubber and effectively prevents dust 
penetration and grease leakage.
Guide Needle Roller Bearings
These bearings are full complement type bearings 
and use mallet-shaped rollers which are guided accurately by the guide rail located at the center of the 
outer ring raceway and the guide groove of the malletshaped roller.  This minimizes skewing (tilting of the 
roller from its rotating axis), which is normally a weak 
point of full complement bearings, and improves the 
rotational accuracy.  This type of bearing is especially 
suitable for heavy loads, shock loads and oscillating 
motions.
Bearings with and without inner rings are available. In 
bearings with an inner ring, the width of the inner ring 
is larger than that of the outer ring.

The identification number of Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings consists of a model code, dimensions, any supplemental codes and a classification 
symbol.  Examples are shown below.
Machined Type Needle Roller Bearings are manufactured based on JIS (See page A31.).  The tolerances 
for the smallest single roller set bore diameter of bearings without inner ring are based on Table 14 on page 
A33.  For BR and BRI series, the accuracy is based 
on Table 2 and the tolerances for the smallest single 
roller set bore diameter are based on Table 3.

■Clearance
Radial internal clearances of Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings are made to the CN clearance shown 
in Table 18 on page A37. Radial internal clearances 
of BRI series are based on Table 4.
■Lubrication
Bearings with prepacked grease are shown in Table 
5.  ALVANIA GREASE S2 (Shell Lubricants Japan 
K.K.) is prepacked as the lubricating grease.
In the case of bearings without prepacked grease, 
perform proper lubrication.  Operating them without 
lubrication will increase the wear of the rolling contact 
surfaces and shorten their lives.
■Fit
The recommended fits for Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings are shown in Tables 22 to 24 on 
pages A41 and A42.

■Oil Hole
Table 6.1 shows the number of oil holes of the outer 
ring and Table 6.2 shows the number of oil holes of 
the inner ring.
When an outer ring with an oil hole is especially 
required for the type without an oil hole, add "−OH" 
before the clearance symbol in the identification number.  When an outer ring with an oil hole and an oil 
groove is required for the type without an oil hole, 
attach "−OG" before the clearance symbol.
      Example: TAFI 203216 −OH C2 P6
When an outer ring with multiple oil holes or an inner 
ring with an oil hole(s) is required, please consult IKO.
■Mounting
Mounting dimensions for Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings are shown in the table of dimensions.
■Matched Set Bearings
When using two or more Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearings adjacent to each other on the same 
shaft, it is necessary to obtain an even load distribution.  On request, a set of bearings is available, in 
which bearings are matched to obtain an even load 
distribution.

■Structure and features
C-Lube Machined Type Needle Roller Bearing is a 
bearing that is lubricated with a newly developed 
thermosetting solid-type lubricant.  A large amount of 
lubricating oil and fine particles of ultra high molecular 
weight polyolefin resin are solidified by heat treatment 
to fill the inner space of the bearing.  As the bearing 
rotates, the  lubricating oil oozes out onto the raceway 
in proper quantities, maintaining the lubrication 
performance for a long period of time.
C-Lube Machined Type Needle Roller Bearings are 
bearings with a low sectional height and large load 
ratings.  The outer ring has high rigidity and can easily 
be used even for light alloy housings. 
■Fit
The recommended fits for C-Lube Machined Type 
Needle Roller Bearings are shown in Tables 21 to 23 
on pages A41 and A42.
■Allowable Rotational Speed
The allowable rotational speed of C-Lube Machined 
Type Needle Roller Bearing is affected by mounting 
and operating conditions.  The reference dmn value (1) 
is 20,000.
Note(1)　dmn value = {(Bore diameter of bearing [mm] + Outside 
diameter of bearing [mm])/2} x rotational 
speed [min-1]
■Accuracy
C-Lube Machined Type Needle Roller Bearings are 
manufactured based on JIS (See page A31.).  The 
tolerances for the smallest single roller set bore diameter of bearings without inner ring are based on Table 
14 on page A33. 
■Type
C-Lube Machined Type Needle Roller Bearing is 
available in type shown in Table 1.
■Identification number
The identification number of C-Lube Machined Type 
Needle Roller Bearing consists of model code, dimensions and classification symbol. Example is shown 
below.
■Mounting
■Precaution for Use
■Lubrication
As the internal space of C-Lube Machined Type 
Needle Roller Bearing is filled with thermosetting 
solid-type lubricant C-Lube, regreasing is not possible 
due to the structure.
■Oil hole
Table 2 shows the number of oil holes on the outer 
ring.

1	 Mounting dimensions for C-Lube Machined Type 
Needle Roller Bearings are shown in the table of 
dimensions.
2	 When mounting, pay special attention to avoid 
locating the oil hole within the loading zone.  This 
may lead to a short bearing life.
1	 Do not wash C-Lube Machined Type Needle 
Roller Bearing with organic solvent and/or white 
kerosene, which have the ability of removing fat 
nor leave them in contact with the above agents.
2	 To ensure normal rotation of the C-Lube Machined 
Type Needle Roller Bearing, apply a load of 1% or 
over of the dynamic load rating at use.
3	 The operating temperature range is -15〜+80˚C. 
For continuous operation, the recommended operating temperature is +60˚C or less.
4	 When using two or more C-Lube Machined Type 
Needle Roller Bearings adjacent to each other on 
the same shaft, it is necessary to obtain an even 
load distribution.  On request, a set of bearings is 
available, in which bearings are matched to obtain 
an even load distribution.
Further, C-Lube Machined Type Needle Roller 
Bearing for food machinery is also available. If needed, please contact IKO.
Note(1)　Thermosetting solid-type lubricant fills inner space of the 
bearing.
