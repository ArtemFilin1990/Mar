SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE
TIMKEN
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF 
GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS 
AND COMPONENTS
To help you get the most value from our products, Timken provides 
guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated ball and roller 
bearings, components and assemblies. Shelf life information is 
based on Timken and industry test data and experience.
SHELF LIFE
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing 
component design life as follows:
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component represents 
the period of time prior to use or installation.
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design life. 
It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to variations 
in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating conditions, 
installation conditions, temperature, humidity and extended 
storage.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF ANY 
BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY ANOTHER PARTY.
European REACH compliance
Timken lubricants, greases and similar products sold in stand 
alone containers or delivery systems are subject to the European 
REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of 
Chemicals) directive. For import into the European Union, Timken 
can sell and provide only those lubricants and greases that are 
registered with ECHA (European Chemicals Agency). For further 
information, please contact your Timken engineer.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for our ﬁnished 
products (bearings, components and assemblies, referred to as 
“products”):
• Unless directed otherwise by Timken, products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
• Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on the 
packaging.
• Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
• After a product is removed from its packaging, it should be 
placed into service as soon as possible.
• When removing a product that is not individually packaged from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the product is removed.
• Do not use product that has exceeded its shelf life as de-
ﬁned in the Timken shelf life guidelines statement.
• The storage area temperature should be maintained between 0° C (32° F) and 40° C (104° F); temperature ﬂuctuations should be minimized.
• The relative humidity should be maintained below 60 percent and the surfaces should be dry.
• The storage area should be kept free from airborne contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, harmful 
vapors, etc.
• The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration.
• Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances or 
applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter storage 
requirements.
Most bearing components typically ship protected with a 
corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant. These 
components may be used in oil-lubricated applications without 
removal of the corrosion-preventive compound. When using 
some specialized grease lubrications, we advise you to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before packing the bearing 
components with suitable grease. 
Be careful in selecting lubrication, however, since different 
lubricants are often incompatible. 
When you receive a bearing shipment, do not remove products 
from their packaging until they are ready for mounting so they 
do not become corroded or contaminated. 
Store bearings and bearing housings in an appropriate atmosphere 
so they remain protected for the intended period.

WARNINGS
Failure to observe the following warnings  
could create a risk of death or serious injury.
Proper maintenance and handling practices are 
critical. Always follow installation instructions and 
maintain proper lubrication.
Tensile stresses can be very high in tightly ﬁtted 
bearing components. Attempting to remove such 
components by cutting the inner ring may result 
in a sudden shattering of the component, causing 
fragments of metal to be forcefully expelled. Always 
use properly guarded presses or bearing pullers 
to remove bearings from shafts, and always use 
suitable personal protective equipment, including 
safety glasses.

BEARING LIFE
BEARING LIFE
The selection of the appropriate bearing for a given application 
is dependent on several performance criteria. These include 
bearing fatigue life, rotating precision, power loss requirement, 
temperature limits, speed capabilities and sound requirements. 
This section deals primarily with bearing life as related to 
material-associated fatigue.
Bearing life is defined as the length of time, or number of 
revolutions, until a fatigue spall of 6 mm2 develops. Since fatigue 
is a statistical phenomenon, the life of an individual bearing 
is impossible to predetermine precisely. Bearings that may 
appear to be identical can exhibit considerable life scatter when 
tested under identical conditions. Thus, it is necessary to base 
life predictions on a statistical evaluation of a large number 
of bearings operating under similar conditions. The Weibull 
distribution function is the accepted standard for predicting the 
life of a population of bearings at any given reliability level.
RATING LIFE
Rating life (L10) is the life that 90 percent of a group of apparently 
identical bearings will complete or exceed before a fatigue spall 
reaching criteria develops. The L10 life also is associated with 
90 percent reliability for a single bearing under a certain load.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Published dynamic load ratings for angular contact ball bearings 
are based on the industry standard procedure outlined in ISO 
281:2007. This rating is designated as Cr and is deﬁned as the radial 
load under which a population of bearings will achieve a L10 life 
of one million revolutions. Radial load is assumed to be constant 
in magnitude and direction for radial ball bearings.
STATIC LOAD RATING
The standard static load rating for Timken bearings (designated 
as C0r) as deﬁned in ISO 76:2006 is based on a maximum contact 
stress within a non-rotating bearing of 4200 MPa at the center 
of the most heavily loaded rolling element and raceway contact. 
Such stress levels may cause visible light Brinell marks 
on the bearing raceways. This degree of marking will not 
have a measurable effect on fatigue life when the bearing is 
subsequently rotated under a lower application load. If sound, 
vibration or torque are critical or if a pronounced shock load is 
present, a lower load limit should be applied. For more information 
on selecting a bearing for static load conditions, consult your 
Timken sales engineer. 
SPEED RATING
THERMAL REFERENCE SPEED
The thermal reference speed is the bearing thermal equilibrium 
speed based on industry standard reference conditions outlined in 
ISO 15312: 2003. Thermal equilibrium balances the heat generated 
by the bearing, with heat conduction through the housing and 
shaft. This standard applies to both bath oil lubricated and 30 
percent grease ﬁll packed bearings. It excludes any heat removed 
by a circulating lubricant. This standard also excludes the outer 
ring rotating application and heat generated by contact seals.
The ISO 15312 thermal reference speed rating calculations are 
based on the following assumptions:
• The bearing ambient temperature is 20° C.
• The tolerable bearing/housing interface temperature is 70° C.
• Oil and grease lubricants are considered.
• For radial bearings with oil lubrication: ISO VG 32 oil.
• For radial bearings with grease lubrication:  
ISO VG 150 grease.
• The radial loads assume a normal clearance (C0 or CN).
• For radial bearings, the applied load is 5 percent of the 
static load rating (C0r). 
Thermal reference speed ratings assume the bearing has been 
sufﬁciently broken in. During the break-in process, temperatures 
may exceed the tolerable limit. Break-in commonly takes between 
10 to 36 hours.
Standard bearing materials and lubricants can generally 
withstand temperatures up to and beyond 100° C. For this reason, 
a permissible temperature of 100° C was assumed for the thermal 
speed rating calculation. Contact your Timken sales engineer if 
your application requires speeds above the Timken published 
values. 
LIMITING SPEED
The limiting speeds for single- and double-row open bearings 
are listed in the product data section (pages 23 to 27). The values 
depend on grease or oil lubrication, and on the various designs of 
open, sealed, and shielded conﬁgurations. The values listed for 
single-row designs reﬂect the lubrication types and are valid only 
for open bearing design conﬁguration. For the double-row sealed 
bearing conﬁguration, the seals themselves become the limiting 
factor due to the additional heat generation at the contact points; 
therefore the grease speed values take into account the seals.
The values listed for double-row bearings with oil lubrication are 
for the open bearing conﬁguration.


TIMKEN® ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARING CATALOG  9
MOUNTING AND FITTING
SINGLE-ROW BEARING DESIGN
Single-row angular contact ball bearings are designed to handle 
radial and axial loads simultaneously. However, they can only 
accommodate axial loads in one direction. As a result, most 
single-row angular contact ball bearings are mounted in pairs. 
Single-row angular contact ball bearings are available in either 
standard or universally matched designs.
In angular contact ball bearing design, the forces are transmitted 
from one raceway to the other along a given contact angle. This 
angle is deﬁned as the angle between the line of action of forces 
and a radial plane (Fig. 3). The result is a larger contact angle 
increasing the bearing’s axial load capability.
CONTACT ANGLE
The contact angle of an angular contact ball bearing is the 
angle between a line through the ball center perpendicular to 
the bearing axis and a line through the two points where the 
ball contacts the races when the bearing axial play is removed.
Timken single-row angular contact ball bearings of series 7200 
and 7300 have a contact angle of 40 degrees and Timken doublerow angular contact ball bearings of series 3200 and 3300 have a 
contact angle of 30 degrees which allow them to accommodate 
high axial loads.
STANDARD DESIGN
Standard design angular contact ball bearings are in applications 
when one bearing is used for each bearing side. The mounting 
can be either back-to-back (DB, Fig. 4) or face-to-face (DF, Fig. 5). 
Because standard design bearings need to be adjusted for 
optimum performance, they are not suitable to mount immediately 
adjacent to each other.

standard DB arrangement.

10  TIMKEN® ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARING CATALOG
UNIVERSALLY MATCHED DESIGN
Universally matched angular contact ball bearings, which are 
intended for ﬁtting in pairs, have width and standout of the rings 
manufactured to closer tolerances. The bearings can be ﬁtted in 
back-to-back (DB), face-to-face (DF), or tandem arrangement (DT).
The bearings are ground to achieve pre-deﬁned clearances/
preloads, and adjustment is achieved directly by clamping the 
bearings. This results in uniform load distribution between the 
paired bearings and eliminates the need for spacers or shims.
The universally matched bearings have a sufﬁx indicating the axial 
clearance and preload values:
• Axial clearance 
CN - Normal  
CS - Smaller than normal 
CL - Larger than normal
• Preload  
UL - Light 
UM - Medium   
UH - Heavy
The axial clearances and preload values corresponding to these 
sufﬁxes are given in table 8 on page 12.

BACK-TO-BACK (DB) ARRANGEMENT
Bearings in a back-to-back arrangement can accommodate 
axial loads in either direction and have the highest moment/
tilting load-handling capability owing to an increased bearing 
spread. With increasing operating temperatures, the radial 
shaft expansion tends to increase the bearing preload. However, 
the resulting axial growth allows the bearings to move apart to 
balance the expansion, thereby mitigating the increase in preload. 
Therefore this type of this type of arrangement is best-suited for 
and most commonly used for high-temperature and high-speed 
applications. 
MOUNTING AND FITTING
Fig. 7. Face-to-face (DF) arrangement.
Fig. 8 Tandem (DT) arrangement.
Fig. 6. Back-to-back (DB) arrangement.
FACE-TO-FACE (DF) ARRANGEMENT
Bearings in face-to-face arrangement also accommodate axial 
loads in either direction, but with reduced stiffness as provided 
by the back-to-back arrangement. This type of arrangement is not 
suitable for high-temperature usage applications as the preload in 
the bearings tends to increase with radial and axial shaft growth.
Since the face-to-face mounting has inherent disadvantages it 
should only be considered with proper application analysis and 
if required due to assembly constraints. 
TANDEM (DT) ARRANGEMENT
Bearings in tandem arrangement can accommodate loads in 
only one direction and are used when the required load-carrying 
capacity exceeds that of a single bearing. Tandem sets must 
be adjusted against another bearing in order to completely 
constrain the system.
More than two bearings can be used in tandem if additional 
load-carrying capability is required.

DOUBLE-ROW BEARING DESIGN AND 
CONFIGURATIONS
Double-row angular contact ball bearings consist of two 
single-row angular contact ball bearings in back-to-back 
(DB) arrangement with integral double inner and outer rings. 
Double-row bearings require less axial space than two singlerow bearings and can take radial loads as well as axial loads in 
both directions. The back-to-back arrangement provides a high 
moment/tilting load-handling capability. 
Double-row angular contact ball bearings can be open on both 
sides, or closed by seals (2RS sufﬁx) or shields (ZZ sufﬁx).

FITTING PRACTICES 
As a general guideline, bearing rings mounted on a rotating 
member should have an interference ﬁt. Loose ﬁts may permit the 
ring to creep or turn and wear the mating surface and backing 
shoulder. This wear can result in excessive bearing looseness 
and damage the bearing, shaft or housing.
The choice of ﬁtting practices will mainly depend upon the 
following parameters:
• Precision class of the bearing.
• Rotating or stationary ring.
• Type of layout (single- or double-row bearings).
• Type and direction of load (continuous/alternate rotating).
• Particular running conditions like shocks, vibrations,  
over-loading or high speed.
• Capability for machining the bearing seats (grinding,  
turning or boring). 
• Shaft and housing section and material.
• Mounting and setting conditions.
Fig. 14 is a graphical representation of bearing shaft and housing 
ﬁt selection that conforms to accepted industry standards 
and practices. The bars designated g6, h6, etc., represent 
shaft/housing diameter and tolerance ranges to achieve various 
loose and interference ﬁts required for various load and ring 
rotation conditions.
Tables 10 and 11, on the following pages, provide the resultant ﬁts 
based on standard ISO tolerances for shaft and housing.

LUBRICATION
LUBRICATION
Bearings must be lubricated to minimize friction between balls 
and raceways, as well as between balls and cages. Lubricants 
also help protect the bearings from corrosion and, in some cases, 
to dissipate heat.
Timken single-row open and double-row open angular contact 
ball bearings are covered with rust preventive (RP) covering all 
bearing surfaces. For such bearings, the end user selects and 
applies the desired lubrication type and quantity as required by 
the application.
Timken double-sealed and shielded angular contact ball 
bearings are covered with RP and factory pre-lubricated with 
water-resistant grease chosen for chemical and mechanical 
stability. The standard grease is Mobil Polyrex EM. This is a

temperatures from -29° C to 120° C. Mobil Polyrex EM provides 
protection against rust and corrosion, and additional protection 
under mild salt-water wash conditions. This grease also is 
widely preferred in electric motor applications.
The standard factory grease ﬁll is 30 to 50 percent of bearing 
free volume for Timken double-sealed/shielded ball bearings. 
The type and amount of grease needed varies depending on 
operating conditions and bearing series. Most bearings can be 
ﬁlled with customer-speciﬁed greases upon request to meet 
speciﬁc application needs. Aside from Mobil Polyrex EM grease, 
Timken also offers a range of other proven and popular greases 
suitable for a wide range of applications. Contact a Timken sales 
engineer for more details.
Table 12 is an overview of the common characteristics for the 
grease used in this product. 
NOTE: For other grease options consult your Timken sales engineer.
