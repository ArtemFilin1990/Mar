Overview
Range of IBC Precision Products for Support of Ball
Screws
Fields of application of 60° super precision angular contact
ball bearings and units:
Rigid but fairly low-friction assembly of ball screws or
satellite screws for conversion of rotary movement into
linear movement (among others, also in worm gears for
rotating tables or in tailstocks).
In particular 60° precision angular contact ball bearings
are used for machine tools or machines and devices with
similar high requirements regarding precision, speed but
also rigidity and a lower friction behaviour and thus a less
heating up of the bearings or components.
Advantages
Of course easy assembly, a long life time, the option
of lifetime lubrication or circulating oil lubrication, as
sometimes employed for driven ball screw nuts are other
features which should be adjusted to match each other
optimally. Next to the open 60° bearings, several sizes are
manufactured with a non-contact rubber seal at both ends.
High axial loads
Whereas contact ball bearings with small contact angles of
15°, 25° mainly absorb radial loads and only qualified axial
loads, the ratio is different in case of 60° super precision
angular contact thrust ball bearings because the axial load
is to be predominated here.
Different preloads
Depending on the required rotational speeds and rigidity, it
is possible to choose between light, medium and heavy
preload.
Rotational speeds
If required, the steel balls are replaced by ceramic balls to
achieve a 35 % increase in rotational speed.
Precision bearing units
For 20 years IBC Wälzlager GmbH has been mounting
open bearings into housings with labyrinth seals. Two
series for driven spindles and driven nuts have turned out
to be the most effective:
a) Cartridge Units with Flanged Housing
b) Pillow Block Units
The cartridge units with integrated labyrinth seal and lifetime lubrication have been revised and designed to allow
for easier mounting. The seat diameter was enlarged to be
able to slide a pre-assembled module (ball screw with it’s
nut + bearing unit, if applicable) through the attachment
bore of the unit. This proved to be helpful for maintenance.
Standard models and options
The units are available as standard, duplex and quadruplex units with lifetime lubrication. The DB duplex units,
which are flattened on both sides can also be provided as
DT tandem unit for applications with longer spindles and a
second bearing side (see page 33). The matching disc
springs and spacers for preloading or a slight stretching of
the spindle are part of the delivery.
Quadruplex units are mainly mounted in QBC tandem-Otandem arrangements but can also be delivered in a QBT
arrangement, i.e. 3:1 stacking of the bearings (of interest
for vertical axes with a preferred direction of load). If required by the customer, additional attachment bores, e.g.
for bellows of the ball screw or additional centring locations for direct flange mounted servo motor mounts can be
integrated.
Securable precision locknuts and labyrinth seals for
preloading of the bearings (units) complete the product
range.

Designation of Bearing Size – Lifetime calculation
2.1 Load carrying capacity and lifetime
For calculation of lifetime according to DIN ISO 281, the
shares of radial and axial load are summarized using the
following equations for dynamic-equivalent (axial) load P(a)
and static-equivalent (axial) load P(ao)

b) The axial load in respect of a single bearing is obtained
using the equations 2.8 to 2.31 according to table 2.2.
Only the number of bearings in load direction can bear
a specific share – in load counter-direction a different
or no-share will be borne, having overcome preload
X · Fv.
The equivalent load P(a) is determined according to the
equation [2.2] using FrE and FaE
Regarding the axial bearing load, the outer load FaE
has to be taken into account in addition to the bearing preload Fv. As forces Fv and Fae are already provided for each
single bearing in Table 2.2 and according to equation [2.8
through 2.31] the nominal life time is calculated using the
basic load rating of the single bearing. In case of spindles,
where different work may be performed in +/– axis direction
it may be necessary to verify lifetime for both directions.
For spring preloaded bearings the following applies to the
bearing (set) exposed to the larger load.
Fa = FSpring + Fae
[2.32]

a2 life adjustment factor for special bearing material
When employing high-quality bearing steel such as
100Cr6 (1.3505) the a2 life adjustment factor 1 for bearing
material is commonly used. Surface coatings and using
ceramic rolling elements (silicon nitride) are increasing the
a2 factor.
a3 life adjustment factor for application conditions
Operating conditions such as adequateness of lubrication
at operating speed and temperature, absolute cleanliness
at the lubricating location or existing particles are influencing lifetime.

Life Time Calculation
The GH62 special grease with a basic oil viscosity of 150
mm2/s at 40 °C and 18 mm2/s at 100 °C has a good load
behaviour and will always allow for an a3 value >1 in case
of clean conditions (see general catalogue). Having calculated the life of single bearings, that of sets, modules or
units is calculated now.
Life time of modules:
L10 unit =

i(A):
number of bearings in the same direction, mounting arrangement A
i(B):
number of bearings in opposite direction, mounting arrangement B
L10(A): lifetime of bearings A
L10(B): lifetime of bearings B
Note:
The general reduction of the dynamic set load rating on
page 22 according to [2.4] for the bearing units consisting
of four bearings – two per direction – in accordance with
DIN ISO 281 to the value i0.7 x Ca, that is to 20.7= 1.62 Ca
in this case, is linked with the following assumption: bearings with normal tolerances have slightly deviating bore
and outer diameters within a set and thus varying load
shares.
The bearings shown in this catalogue, however, are manufactured to the stricter tolerances of P4A or P2H and thus
provide a certain guarantee for an even load behaviour.
(Since the forces have been multiplied by the value 1/i0.7 in
accordance with the equations [2.7] and table 2.2, the
load rating Ca of the single bearing according to p. 8 has
to be used. If the type is not known, the load rating of the
quadruplex set can be divided by 1.62 to obtain the Ca of
the single bearing).
2.2
Selection of preloads – axial stiffness and unloading factors in comparison
Operating the rolling elements with at least a minimum
preload prevents an uneven wear of the balls. This wear is
caused by a partial sliding instead of rolling of the balls
with clearance in the no-load range between the bearing
rings and the balls. In case of the O-arrangement (DB),
starting at an outer axial load larger than 3 times the preload, the bearing facing away from the load becomes
gradually unloaded. The balls in this bearing will start to
slide with increasing load. (In case of the less frequently
used X arrangement (DF), the bearing facing the load
would be unloaded as load is applied to the inner ring.)
Relatively to the more frequently employed types of O
arrangement, the X*Fv characteristic values for unloading
the bearings which are not positioned directly in the flow of
force, the axial stiffness factors in both load directions and
the KFv preload factor for determination of the tightening
torque of the nut are given (see page 27). (KFv does not
take into account possible press fittings.) Bearing arrangements with a different number of bearings per direction
result in a differing axial stiffness corresponding to the
number of bearings in the respective direction.
Preload values Fv see page 9.

60° Super Precision Angular Contact Thrust Ball Bearings
IBC angular contact thrust ball bearings have been developed to meet the demands of high thrust load for ball
screw support application.
The large contact angle of 60° allows for high thrust load
with high stiffness. The radial load should not extend
90 % of the preload.
As angular contact bearings can carry load only in one
direction they therefore have to be adjusted to another
bearing of the same kind.
The bearings are primarily supplied as single ones or in
sets of 2 or 4 bearings to be mounted in back-to-back
arrangements.
Angular contact thrust bearings are manufactured for universal matching, thus they can be rearranged and can be
mounted in any arrangement.
As a standard single bearings have a medium or high preload, sets have a V-marking, single doesn’t.
Precision grades: Bore and O.D. are manufactured to
precision class P4A; axial run out Sd and Sia are restricted
to P2A (see page 10).
Preload
60°-Angular contact bearings are available with light,
medium and high preload. They are apt for mounting in
sets. For preloading we recommend the locknuts of series
MMRB or MMRS (starting page 28). With tight fits the preload will be enhanced.
Material of rings and balls
Standard: bearing steel 100Cr6 (1.3505)
Options:
CB: ceramic Si3N4 with speed increase of 35 %
AC: rings thin dense chromium ATCoated (details to the
option see page 34, glossary)
Cage: The one-piece glass fibre, reinforced polyamide
cage is ball guided. As standard this is not designated.
Themperature range –30 to 120 °C.
Lubrication:
The bearings are supplied with approved special greases
as standard:
a) For lower and medium speed: with the high viscose
BearLub GH62
b) For top speed range: with BearLub GN21. For this
grease the speed limits are given in the data tables on
page 9 and 22. For technical information on greases
see page 34.
(Bearings with oil lubrication holes on request).
Sealing
Most of the bearings are supplied as open bearings and
can be combined with labyrinth-seals of series S acc. to
page 29.
The types on page 8 marked with + are also manufactured
with non-touching seals .2RSZ.

Precision Bearing Units with 60°-Angular Contact Thrust Bearings – Selection Criteria
Applications of units with labyrinth seals greased for life:
Ball screws (bs), satellite roller screws, worm gear drives
(e. g. for circular tables, index tables) special purposes.
Basically the units are used on ball screws in machine
tool (boring-, milling-, turning-, grinding-, spark erosion
machines, machining centers, endfacing machines, gear
cutting and finishing machines), measuring machines,
industrial robots, sheet metal cutting machines,
(presses, levelling machines, bending centers, laser
cutting machines, laser marking machines, forming
machines), woodworking machines and special purpose
machines.
The big amount of applications have created a unit assembly system with their different needs regarding
axial stiffness and capacity
reduced heat development by less friction (labyrinth
seal)
speed (also with ceramic balls available)
running accuracy
form (flange or pillow block)
arrangement.
Great flexibility
Some precision bearing units can be supplied with the
same outside dimensions but with different bore sizes.
This has been very helpful in the design of machine
families of different length and table stroke, where the ball
screws of smaller dia. would have reached the critical
speed and therefore a bigger one had to be used. (Bearings with same outside diameter and width but different
bore allow a standardisation of adjacent parts at low cost).
Simply mounting
Whereas at the beginning (a) ball screw bearings had to
be built in separately with other parts, now the ready-tomount units are the state of art. The mounting of complete
subassemblies eases and speeds up the mounting. The
avoidance of an axial reference face in the housing bore
simplifies surrounding parts.
For the flange housings only a hole with a machined wall
square to the housing axes is needed. The unit can then
radially still be adjusted (b).
Users who machine the centering hole for the flange into
their supports on CNC machines with the needed accuracy mount as shown in (c).
Figure 4.1: Development to easier to machine and to mount applications for ball screw supports.

Precision Bearing Units with 60°-Angular Contact Thrust Bearings – Selection Criteria
Easy-to-mount BSBU, BSBU-M Precision Cartridge
Units
The cartridge units flattened on both sides are characterized by easy handling in the planning and mounting phase.
The fact that they are flattened on both sides results in a
low height, corresponding to the cartridge diameter. It was
chosen so that in case of usual grading of the shaft seat,
the cartridge outside diameter of the nut is slightly smaller
than the bearing unit seat diameter.
When service is necessary, in case of a machine tool
crash, the mounting personnel on site will appreciate that
the module is easy to change (ball screw + bearing unit).
Owing to the skilfully selected diameter ratio (see drawing
57-803 and 57-804), it is possible to pull out the entire
module easily.
In the same manner, a pre-assembled module is built in
again quickly, so that maintenance times and thus standstill times are reduced.
The locknut with matching labyrinth seal, which has already been integrated into the BSBU-M series, allows for simple and secure preloading of precision cartridge units.
In case the cartridge unit has to be mounted from inside
against a wall the locknut MMRS and the sealing S can be
exchanged vice versa. The same applies for the pillow
block series BSPB-M… as well as for the adapter of the
nut bearing units BNBU and BNPB.


Precision Bearing Units with 60°-Angular Contact Thrust Bearings – Selection Criteria
Advantages of pillow block units
Whereas cartridge units had to be placed on supports in
the past, the pillow block units are saving construction
space and mounting time.
The tight-tolerance bases of the fixed and floating end
units with the same reference dimensions of the BSPB,
BSPB-M and BLPB series have proven to be beneficial
(see abutment dimensions on page 24). The contact edge
for the units can thus be machined with those of the
guides. Pre-drilled pin-holes allow accurate fixing.
Mounting of driven nuts
IBC precision bearing units of the series BNBU and BNPB
with integrated adapter are available for mounting on ball
screw nuts (according to DIN 69051). These are used in
particular for long ball screws. It is an advantage to drive
the nut for its less accelerated mass.
A further advantage of a driven spindle clamped between
two fixed end bearings is the fact that in case of an
alternative nut drive, the bearings do not need to accommodate stretching loads.
The stretching of the spindle to compensate elongation
when it warms up can easily be carried out there at the
clamping points.
Depending on the requirements regarding stiffness, limit
rotational speed or drag torque, units can be chosen with
light (L), medium (M) or heavy (H) preload. The order code
consists of the basic type and a suffix for the preload. For
adapter units, it is possible to choose the hole pattern and
the way of mounting, the cartridge form can additionally be
chosen.
For bearing units with an integrated lubrication system for
the ball screw nut (BNBUS) separate data sheets are
available.

BSPB.M 40Q65 QBTM with arrangement Ø Ø Ø
Units for predominating loads in one direction
Bearings of vertical or inclined spindles, which have to
support a sometimes-considerable weight of the table, one
direction may be predominant for all load cycles owing to
inertia. In that case a unit with the bearing arrangement
3:1 (with the designation QBT before the preload) can be
selected (see figure 4.2). The load shares of the single
bearing result from the equations (page 5), stiffness, unloading values and tightening factors in figure 2.2, page 6
in connection with the specification for single bearings
according to pages 8 and 9.


4.1
Designation of IBC Precision Bearing Units for Ball Screws
For fixed end bearing units for higher speed, also bearings
with ceramic balls (CB) can be offered. On request also
with ATCoat (AC) for bearings.
Bearing units with more bearings on request, as well as
special housings with integrated coupling.
Lubrication
Bearings with standard lubrication GH 62; without suffix.
Bearings with grease for higher speed: suffix GN21G
(for more than 60 % of mentioned max. speed).
Grease details see page 34.

Criteria for Bearing Arrangements at Ball screws
Application examples – influence of bearing arrangement on critical speed, spindle buckling resistance
and stiffness.
The mounting and bearing arrangement at a spindle
influences the critical speed, the buckling behaviour and
the total stiffness.
4.9.1 Critical Rotational Speed nkr
The critical rotational speed (1st order) where the spindle
starts to bulge depends on the spindle diameter do, the
non-support spindle length I and the bearing arrangement.
The permissible speed should be obtained using factor 0.8
of the diagram value.
4.9.3 Stiffness
The axial stiffness of a ball screw KaBS is mainly dependant on (in precisely this order) the stiffness of the spindle
as follows:
4.9.2 Buckling
Very long and thin spindles must be checked for buckling.
An alternative bearing arrangement increases the permissible axial load.

The fundamentally different type of clamping (of the

1) Fixed clamping at one end
2) Fixed clamping at both ends
a) for driven spindle (see also page 19, 32)
b) for driven nut (see page 20), e.g. assembled with
BNBU 63QB130 2.M.M2 with integrated labyrinth
seals, n = 1000 min–1. Spindle Ø 40 x 10 fixed at

Criteria for Bearing Arrangements at Ball screws
3) Spring-preloaded Fixed End Floating End
Combinations
Where a high operating speed leads to a high heat generation and expansion of the spindle, a fixed clamping at
both ends is no longer useful. In this case it is better to
clamp one end and to preload the other end by means of
springs. The required preload can be set via the springs.
By selecting an appropriate spring tension, the expansion
due to heat is practically compensated without loss of preload and the stiffness of the spindle is kept on a constant
level.
The two mounting examples with drawings for inquiry (see
p. 33) are helpful in dealing with specific customer wishes.
The first example shows the combination of cartridge
units, the second the combination of pillow block units. Of
course, it is also easily possible to combine cartridge and
pillow block units, because the final processing for the
spindles is the same for both.
In addition to the arrangement with spring-preloaded end
in DT arrangement, fixed end and if applicable, floating
end QBT arrangements are possible, too (see p. 14).
4) Combinations of fixed end bearing units with floating end bearing units, series BLPB and BLBU
Whereas the stretching of the spindle and increasing the
stiffness plays the most important role in case of fixed end
bearing units and spring-preloaded units, preventing the
spindle end from whirling around is the main objective
here (see p. 23).
For combinations with series BSPB fixed end pillow block
units, the pillow block units were designed with the same
centre height and the same lateral stopping dimension.
This permits the units to be adjoined to the same
machined reference edge. The alignment is thus facilitated
(see figure 57-601, 57-602, p. 24).
Ball screw supported at both ends with BSBU-M… QB + BSBU … DB … DT+PLS, can be stretched and preloaded via securable locknuts.

IBC Precision Locknuts and Labyrinth Seals
Applications
IBC Precision Locknuts are used for high-precision application owing to their high degree of accuracy. The no longer necessary retaining groove in the shafts (for the formerly used lock washers) facilitates production and
assembly. The material cross section is maintained and
the notch effect is not increased un-necessarily. Accuracy
is increased by elimination of the imprecise lock washers
(axial runout is reduced).
Tolerances
A high accuracy of the axial eccentricity according to IT3,
ISO basic tolerances according to DIN 7151 (see p. 11),
will be achieved by precision-machining the inner thread
with its securing elements and the face in one operation.
The face will be additionally compressed during machining. The securing elements, which are also profiled, bear
on the thread flanks. The thread is manufactured with a
tolerance of 4H according to DIN 13 T21-24. From
M210x4 on, the tolerance is 6H.
Design
For compact applications (lightest weight), series MMR
locknuts are used. The locknut in recessed locations which
cannot be reached radially (housing bores) are secured
using the axially accessible socket set screws on the MMA
and MBA series nuts. This option requires a larger width
because of the inner construction. From Ø 20 on, the MBA
model is supplied. The permissible axial load corresponds
to the MMR nut.
The same cross section as MBA is used for MMRB and
thus permits larger loads and tightening torques. This is of
interest in particular for preloading bearings supporting a
high axial load (in ball screws, for instance).
Nuts with Labyrinth Seal
The MMRBS and MBAS series additionally have a set of
laminar rings made out of spring steel, which may create a
compact labyrinth seal in conjunction with the housing
where limited space is available. The intermediate space
of the labyrinth area must be filled with grease before and
after mounting.
The cross section of the series MMRS nuts with similar
properties as MMRBS nuts were designed to match the
series BS 60° Super Precision Angular Contact Thrust Ball
Bearings and the MD Seal Nuts (see page 24, 28 and 29).
These are available in the standard sizes as well as in
special sizes (different cross section) or made from stainless steel or with ATCoating.
Abutment and Fillet Dimensions
The recommended tolerance of the counter thread of the
shaft is “medium” 6g, 6h or “fine” 4h for higher accuracy
requirements (machine tools).
Strength of the Nut Threads
Threads up to M50: 1000 N/mm2
Threads up to M55 – M85: 870 N/mm2
Threads from M90 on: 700 N/mm2
The permissible axial loads are applicable to bolt threads
with a tensile strength of at least 700 N/mm2. In case of
dynamic load, 75 % of Fa is permissible.
Mounting
Nut to be screwed in with all locking devices in unchanged
positions. Use spanners to tighten the locknuts with
approx. double of the nominal torque (to avoid setting of
the clamped parts), loosen and retighten them applying
the nominal torque. The necessary tightening torque
depends on the required preload Fv [N] and can be determined approximately using the following equation:
MD = 3 · d Thread · Fv · KFv · 10–4 [Nm]
[5.1]
KFv:
bearing arrangement constant

KFv = 1 for bearing units with Fv preload for the unit, see p. 22.
(A single tightening with MD is sufficient for the heavily preloaded 60°
super precision angular contact thrust ball bearings).
Securing against loosening
First tighten securing screw via hexagon socket set screw
lightly until you notice resistance. Tighten second screw
located opposite. If existing, tighten third screw (only in
case of MMRB, MMRBS and MMRS) and fourth screw in
model …Q. Retighten screws. For maximum tightening
torques of the socket set screws, please refer to table.

Table 5.1: Maximum tightening torques of securing devices
This results in high loosening torques to prevent unintended loosening even for spindles running clockwise and
counter-clockwise intermittently.
Disassembly
Loosen securing elements first for disassembly. Since
clamping does not deform the profiled securing elements
made from hard bronze, the nut can be used repeatedly
after loosening.

to be filled with the same grease as used for the bearings.

5.2
Labyrinth Seals S
Seal Nuts MD
The non-contact series S sealing elements consist of a
ground parallel steel ring with a radial outside groove. A
set of laminar spring-steel rings is assembled into the
groove, surrounded by a grease pack (GH62).
These are pressed into the bore of the matching series
MD seal nut or into a housing bore via a chamfer and are
thus fixed.
The spacer (support ring) of the labyrinth seal located on
the shaft thus turns without touching the opposite lamella.
A grease pack in the groove prevents the axial contact of
the lamella with the walls. The Labyrinth Seals have proven to be of advantage adjoining bearings preloaded via
these seals (Angular Contact Ball Bearings and 60° Super
Precision Angular Contact Ball Bearings).
The Seal Nuts MD with outside thread can also be used
separately to clamp outer bearing rings or other machine
parts. They need to be secured by glue. An external radial
lock is also possible.
Further sizes are available on inquiry.

5.4
Pretension of spindles with Precision Locknuts
5.4.1 Application with two Fixed End Bearings and Stretched
Spindle
Two locknuts with integrated labyrinth seal are used at one end.
The interior nut should have a 2–5 mm larger thread diameter, e.g.
MMRS 30-60.Q2 + MMRS 35-60.Q2 with a bearing support series
BSPB-M 30Q50 or BSBU-M30QB98.
5) Determine zero-value position at axial spindle reference surface via dial indicator. Then loosen locknut 2 a
bit and carefully tighten locknut 3 until the dial of the
indicator displays the setpoint stretching value. (For
locknuts up to Ø 50, the pitch is 1.5 mm for 360° which
corresponds e. g. to a stretch of 4.2 µm at an angle of
rotation of 1°, from threat Ø 55 x 2 on, 5.6 µm correspond to 1° angle of rotation.)
6) Tighten locknut 2 with tightening torque MD against the
bearing package and lock.
Spindle Stretching Procedure
1) The right-hand unit is screwed and pinned, locknut 1 is
preloaded with tightening torque MD acc. to page 27.
2) Tighten the base of the left-hand unit lightly.
3) Tighten locknuts 2 and 3 lightly first and then tighten
them against each other and tighten locknut 3 with MD.
4) Tighten screws in the base of the left-hand unit fully
(ream and pin pre-drilled holes and pin).
Left-hand side of bearing (stretching side)
Right-hand side of bearing
d4 > d3 by one thread size (see MMRS on page 28)
(MMRS 25-36.Q2, MMRS 35-50.Q2 and other intermediate sizes are manufactured upon demand.
As an alternative, the series MMRB locknuts can be used next to the labyrinth seal).
5.4.2 Stretching and preloading spring-preloaded spindles and bearing units
If larger expansion of the spindles due to heat is expected,
the spindles and bearings are preloaded using separate
MMRB locknuts. On the following page, two drawings for
inquiry show the basic structure of these cartridge or pillow
block units. Of course, a combination of these designs is
possible.
The preload and thus the required stiffness are set via the
spring path of the disc springs. When the drawing for
inquiry is processed, details are discussed with the customer. For this purpose, the drawings may be copied and
the required bearing units entered in accordance with the
present catalogue.
At the floating end, the shaft d1 has to be executed with a
g4 or g5 seat.
