The TQ series scores in each performance category: high torque 
density, high overload capacity, exceptional precision and low 
vibration. TQ is particularly suited for the highly demanding 
requirements of servo systems, such as fast dynamics and 
frequent reverse motion, precise position, motion control and high 
numbers of starts and stops.

Low backlash planetary drives of TQ series combine outstanding performances with a distinctive Italian style which makes them imme­
diately recognizable amongst similar products within the reference industry.
Their design and construction has been developed with the goal of offering consumers a line of products which feature absolute and 
consistent Quality, which in turn provides a competitive advantage for machines and systems that adopt them as transmission devices.
•	 TQ features two classes of precision, corresponding to the following values of circumferential backlash
	 1-stage units:	 standard ϕS ≤ 3’   reduced  ϕR ≤ 2’ ( ϕs ≤ 4’;  ϕR ≤ 2’ for TQ 060 and TQ 070)
	 2-stage units:	 standard ϕS ≤ 5’   reduced ϕR ≤ 3’ (ϕs ≤ 6’; ϕR ≤ 4’ for TQ 060 and TQ 070)
•	 A high IP rating (IP65) provides inner parts with protection against the ingress of dust and liquids.
•	 Input section oil seals made from a Fluoroelastomer compound are supplied as standard.
•	 Noise pressure level 60 ≤ Lp ≤ 70 dB(A). Conditions: distance 1 m ; measured without load and an input speed of n1 = 3000 min-1; i = 10.
•	 Numerous adapters allow matching the most popular brands of servomotors.
•	 Lubrication optimized for the type of duty specified when ordering.
	 In the absence of contamination the lubricant requires no periodical changes.

FEATURES OF TQK SERIES
Low backlash bevel-planetary drives of the TQK series are the solution to space problems often posed by increasingly compact machines.
TQK drives combine high levels of dynamic operation with top precision, which results in great accuracy and repeatability for any positio­
ning mechanism in which they are installed.
On top of their robustness and dependability TQK drives also feature a distinctive Italian style that makes them clearly recognizable 
amongst like products within the reference industry.
•	 TQK features two classes of precision, corresponding to the following values of circumferential backlash
	 2-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 5’; reduced ϕR ≤ 4’ (ϕS ≤ 6’; ϕR ≤ 5’ for TQK 060 and TQK 070)
	 3-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 7’; reduced ϕR ≤ 6’ (ϕS ≤ 8’; ϕR ≤ 7’ for TQK 060 and TQK 070)
•	 A high IP rating (IP65) provides inner parts with protection against the ingress of dust and liquids.
•	 Input section oil seals made from a Fluoroelastomer compound are supplied as standard.

FEATURES OF TR SERIES
Planetary gear units of the TR series belong to a range of low backlash drives very broad and complete as far as transmissible torque, gear 
ratios and circumferential backlash.
All units are generously proportioned to run quietly and provide a long service life without maintenance requirements.
Motor mounting is an operation that can be easily conducted without the need of any particular tooling, other than that usually available in 
a normally equipped workshop.
•	 Available with either standard (STD) or reduced (LOW) backlash:
	 1-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 5’; reduced ϕR ≤ 3’
	 2-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 5’; reduced ϕR ≤ 3’
	 3-stage units (G and MB only): standard ϕR ≤ 5’; reduced ϕR ≤ 3’
	 3-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 7’; reduced ϕR ≤ 5’
	 4-stage units (G and MB only): standard ϕS ≤ 7’; reduced ϕR ≤ 5’
•	 A high IP rating (IP65) provides inner parts with protection against the ingress of dust and liquids.
•	 Input section oil seals made from a Fluoroelastomer compound are supplied for S5 intermittent duty cycle.
•	 Noise pressure level LP ≤ 70 dB(A). Conditions: distance 1 m; measured without load an input speed of n1 = 3000 min-1; i=10.
•	 Bearings suitably rated for an average service life of 20,000 hours under nominal operating conditions. The following chart shows the 
types of bearings for the output shaft.

5.3.1	 MACHINE SHAFT
Shaft of driven equipment should be made from high grade alloy steel. Table below shows recommended dimensions for the Customer to 
consider when designing mating shaft. A device retaining the shaft axially is also recommended (not shown).
The number and size of relative tapped holes at shaft end depend on application requirements.


103
The MP series is characterized by a wide range of torque 
and multiple sizes, great modularity due to multiple design 
confi gurations a wide ratios range and different optimized 
lubrications ensuring high reliability and the most fi tting response 
to different applications requirements.

FEATURES OF MP SERIES
Planetary gear units of the MP series belong to a range of low backlash drives very broad and complete as far as transmissible torque, gear 
ratios and circumferential backlash.
All units are generously proportioned to run quietly and provide a long service life without maintenance requirements.
Motor mounting is an operation that can be easily conducted without the need of any particular tooling, other than that usually available in 
a normally equipped workshop.
•	 Available with either standard (STD) or reduced (LOW) backlash:
	 1-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 15’; reduced ϕR ≤ 10’  
	 2-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 15’; reduced ϕR ≤ 10’
	 3-stage units (G and MB only): standard ϕR ≤ 15’; reduced ϕR ≤ 10’
	 3-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 17’; reduced ϕR ≤ 12’
	 4-stage units (G and MB only): standard ϕS ≤ 17’; reduced ϕR ≤ 12’
•	 A high IP rating (IP65) provides inner parts with protection against the ingress of dust and liquids.
•	 Input section oil seals made from a Fluoroelastomer compound are supplied for S5 intermittent duty cycle.
•	 Noise pressure level LP ≤ 70 dB(A). Conditions: distance 1 m; measured without load an input speed of n1 = 3000 min-1; i=10.
•	 Bearings suitably rated for an average service life of 20,000 hours under nominal operating conditions. The following chart shows the 
types of bearings for the output shaft.

FEATURES OF LC SERIES
Planetary gear units of the LC series belong to a range of low backlash drives very broad and complete as far as transmissible torque, 
gear ratios and circumferential backlash.
All units are generously proportioned to run quietly and provide a long service life without maintenance requirements.
Motor mounting is an operation that can be easily conducted without the need of any particular tooling, other than that usually available 
in a normally equipped workshop.
•	 Available with either standard (STD) or reduced (LOW) backlash:
	 1-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 12’; reduced ϕR ≤ 6’
	 2-stage units: standard ϕS ≤ 15’; reduced ϕR ≤ 8’
•	 Its degree of protection IP54 provides protection against dust and liquid splashes.
•	 Input section oil seals made from a Fluoroelastomer compound are supplied as standard.
•	 Noise pressure level LP ≤ 70 dB(A). Conditions: distance 1 m; measured without load an input speed of n1 = 3000 min-1; i=10.
•	 Wide range of adapter flanges matching the most popular brands of motors
•	 Units are factory filled with synthetic grease to NLGI consistency class 00, in the absence of contamination the lubricant requires no 
periodical changes.
•	 Ambient temperature min -20°C, max +30°C. For temperature higher than 30°C please consider derating factor fT.
•	 Available as Version P with higher output torque.
