Features
INA radial insert ball bearings are robust, ready-to-fit rolling 
bearings for the design of particularly economical bearing mounts. 
These robust machine elements are available in numerous designs 
that differ essentially in the outside surface of the outer ring, 
the method of location on the shaft and the sealing arrangement.
The classic areas of application for these bearings include the 
agricultural, construction and mining sector, conveying equipment, 
textile, paper and woodworking machinery as well as machines for 
the filling, timber and packaging industries.
Radial insert ball bearings comprise solid outer rings, inner rings 
extended on one or both sides, cages made from plastic or sheet 
steel and contact seals on both sides. Bearings with an inner ring 
extended on both sides undergo less tilting of the inner ring and 
therefore run more smoothly.
Inner rings and locking collars are plated with Corrotect®.  
For information on Corrotect®, see page 4.
Compensation
of misalignment
The outer ring has a spherical or cylindrical outside surface.
In conjunction with an INA housing with a concave bore matched 
to the bearing design, bearings with a spherical outer ring can 
compensate static misalignments of the shaft, see Compensation 
of misalignments, page 10.
Location on the shaft
Radial insert ball bearings are located on the shaft by means of 
an eccentric locking collar or two set screws in the inner ring.
Radial insert ball bearings
with eccentric locking collar
These “classic” INA radial insert ball bearings are located on 
the shaft by means of a locking collar, Figure 1. They are particularly 
suitable for bearing mounts with a constant direction of rotation or, 
under low speed and load, for an alternating direction of rotation.
The locking collar is preferably tightened in the direction of rotation 
and secured by means of a set screw. This location method prevents 
damage to the shaft and can be easily loosened again.

Radial insert ball bearings


Radial insert ball bearings
with set screws
in the inner ring
In these radial insert ball bearings, the inner ring is located on 
the shaft by means of two set screws offset by 120°, Figure 2. 
This location method is suitable for bearing mounts with a constant 
direction of rotation or, under low speed and load, for an alternating 
direction of rotation.
The set screws are self-locking and have a fine-pitch thread with cup 
point for secure location of the bearings on the shaft.
Sealing/lubrication
The bearings are sealed on both sides by means of P or R type seals, 
see table Seal types.
P and R type seals are of a three-piece design. This concept ensures, 
due to the rigidly rolled-in sheet steel washer, optimum seating in 
the bearing as well as concentric alignment of the seal lip to 
the inner ring. In conjunction with the seal type and the sealing ring 
material, the bearings are thus reliable in operation even under 
difficult environmental conditions.
Radial insert ball bearings are greased and can be relubricated.

P seal
Two zinc-plated sheet steel washers with 
intermediate NBR part, seal lip axially preloaded.
In order to protect the seal lip from mechanical damage, 
the outer sheet steel washer extends a considerable 
distance down towards the bearing inner ring.
Used in narrow radial insert ball bearings with 
inner ring extended on one side.
R seal
Two zinc-plated sheet steel washers extended 
outwards and angled downwards with intermediate NBR 
part and radially preloaded seal lip. 
Better protection against mechanical damage.
Substantial grease reservoir due to the space between 
the extended and angled sheet steel washers. 
Used in radial insert ball bearings with inner ring 
extended on both sides.

Corrotect® plating
The special INA plating Corrotect®  is an economical alternative 
to traditional forms of corrosion protection for radial insert ball 
bearings.
Advantages of
the Corrotect® plating
■All-round anti-corrosion protection – even on machined surfaces 
on chamfers and radii
■Long-term prevention of rust penetration beneath seals
■Small bright spots are protected against corrosion by 
the cathodic protection mechanism
■Anti-corrosion protection allows a significantly longer operating 
life compared to unplated parts
■Uncoated bearings and housings are fully interchangeable with 
the coated versions of the same design
■Bearings and housings made from corrosion-resistant rolling 
bearing steel are often no longer required. 
Corrosion-resistant radial insert ball bearings are suitable where 
moisture, contaminated water, salt spray mist or weakly alkaline 
and weakly acidic cleaning agents are present.
For further information on Corrotect®, see also the section 
Anti-corrosion protection, catalog Rolling Bearings, HR1.
Speed limits for
radial insert ball bearings –
guide values
The speed limits are dependent on the load, the clearance between 
the bearing bore and shaft and the friction of the seals in bearings 
with contact seals.
Figure 3 gives guide values for the permissible speeds. 
In the case of load ratios Cr/P  13, the speeds can be increased. 
For these applications, please contact us.
If Cr/P  5, location by means of interference fit is recommended.

The permissible shaft tolerance is dependent on the speed and 
load. Tolerances from h6 to h9 are possible. Conventional drawn 
shafts will suffice for most applications.

Features
INA housing units are available as pillow block and flanged housing 
units in numerous different designs.
The units are ready-to-fit and comprise INA cast iron housings with 
a concave bore in which INA radial insert ball bearings are fitted. 
In order to ensure function and reliability under all operating 
conditions, the bearings and housings are matched to each other.
Due to the wide range of housing designs, the right solution can 
be found for any specific application. The areas of application of 
the units correspond to those of the insert bearings.
Due to the spherical outside surface of the bearing outer ring and 
the concave housing bore, housing units can compensate for static 
angular misalignment of the shaft; see Compensation of 
misalignments, Figure 1.
The units are used predominantly as locating bearings, but are also 
suitable as non-locating bearings under low loads and speeds.
Bolts are used to fasten the housings to the mounting surfaces. 
Less stringent tolerances are adequate for the bolts mounting 
surfaces; see Design of adjacent construction, page 12.
Compensation of
misalignments
Units with a spherical outer ring and concave housing bore can 
compensate for static misalignment of the shaft, Figure 1:
■if relubrication is used, up to 2.5°
■if relubrication is not used, up to 5°.
Caution!
These units are not suitable for dynamic misalignment; 
continuous swiveling or tumbling of the bearing within the housing 
will cause premature failure.

Housing units
with cast iron housing
Cast iron housings are single-piece units with high load carrying 
capacity; see Load carrying capacity of housings, page 12.
For relubrication of the radial insert ball bearings, the housing bore 
has a lubrication groove and the housing has a lubrication hole for 
conventional lubrication nipples.
Cast iron units are available as pillow block and flanged housing 
units, Figure 2 and Figure 3.
Housing materials
The material used for the cast iron housings is cast iron to 
ASTM A48 Class 30.

Caution!
Due to their versatile characteristics, INA housings can be used 
without difficulty in almost all industrial sectors.
If bearing mounts are planned for equipment in which a malfunction 
could be hazardous to persons or an unplanned stoppage of 
the machine could cause major disruption, it is essential that you 
consult us before proceeding with the design.
Cast iron housings –
radial load carrying capacity
Cast iron housings can support the same radial loads as the radial 
insert ball bearings fitted. The static load carrying capacity of 
the radial insert ball bearings C0r is stated in the dimension tables.
For shock loads, appropriate safety factors must be applied. 
In this case, please contact us.
Axial load carrying capacity
The axial load carrying capacity of cast iron housings is restricted 
to 0.50C0r.
Design of
adjacent construction
Bolts mounting surfaces
Recommendations for the bolt mounting surfaces:
■roughness of the bolt mounting surfaces max. Ra12,5 (Rz63)
■geometrical and positional tolerance 0,04/100 concave, 
spherical not permissible.
Mounting bolts
Bolts should be grade 5 or better and washers and/or lock washers 
are recommended.
The bolts are not included in the delivery.
Rolling Bearing Catalog HR1
The complete standard range of radial insert ball bearings 
is described in comprehensive detail in the Rolling Bearing 
Catalog HR1.
Caution!
This catalog must be taken as the basis for the design of bearing 
mounts.
