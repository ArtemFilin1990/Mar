SKF heavy-duty 
spherical plain bearings
Steel/steel spherical plain bearings  
with LS heavy-duty seals
• Increased service life
• Lower system costs 
• Minimal maintenance


A set of strong 
elements
The SKF heavy-duty system for spherical 
plain bearings is a modular solution char­
acterized by the following:
• tough steel/steel spherical plain bearings
• multi-groove system
• LS heavy-duty seals
• high-performance lubricants
Each one of these elements provides  
a ­benefit, which when compounded, can 
­provide the following benefits:
• minimize maintenance
• create more robust bearing arrangements with fewer parts
• improve performance substantially.

A combination of these elements makes  
the SKF heavy-duty system an excellent  
solution for applications that must operate 
reliably in extreme environments. 


The heavy-duty 
system
Steel/steel bearings
For heavy-duty applications, the bearing  
selection process is extremely important. 
­Typically, the bearings in these types of  
applications must accommodate:
• heavy alternating loads
• shock loads
• heavy static loads
Steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings 
(† fig. 1) are an excellent choice for these 
applications, because the high strength  
of the sliding contact surfaces provides  
superior performance under these load 
conditions.
The multi-groove system
The multi-groove system optimizes both the 
effectiveness of the lubricant and the lubrication conditions within the bearing. Bene­
fits of the multi-groove system include:
• more grease inside the bearing
• better grease distribution
• grease remains fresh longer
• bearings can be relubricated even when 
fully loaded
The multi-groove system can, depending on 
the oscillating angle, improve bearing service life. Depending on the application, as 
the oscillating angle decreases, service life 
increases. Increases up to 200% are possible 
(† diagram 1). 
The multi-groove system promotes a better 
lubrication condition inside the bearing
The multi-groove system provides a reservoir 
for grease inside the bearing, even under load 
conditions

The LS heavy-duty seal
To perform well for long periods under harsh 
operating conditions, the seal must be located 
firmly and protected from damage. To achieve 
this, the LS heavy-duty seal has been reinforced with a steel insert († fig. 2). This insert 
increases retention forces considerably 
(† diagram 2) and closely covers the seal 
lip, protecting it from larger sized contam­
inants.
Designed for harsh environments, the 
LS heavy-duty seal was developed for long 
service life in highly contaminated environments. The result is a three-lip seal specially 
designed for:
• dimensional stability
• optimum stiffness
These characteristics provide a very reliable 
contact between the seal lips and the inner 
ring. The design of the seal lips creates a 
safe opening from the inside-out to provide 
a number of advantages including:
• virtually eliminates the ingress of contaminants into the bearing († fig. 3)
• enables excess grease to escape from the 
bearing during relubrication († fig. 4)
These advantages can significantly improve 
bearing service life. Also, relubrication intervals can be extended, because there are 
fewer contaminants inside the bearing that 
need to be expelled.
In tests under severe operating conditions 
(† diagram 3), the service life1) of an LS 
heavy-duty seal was shown to last three 
times longer than standard seals. Made of 
long-lasting, oil and wear-resistant acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), these seals 
are suitable for operating temperatures  
between –55 and +110 °C (–67 and +230 °F) 
and up to +125 °C (+257 °F) for short periods. 
NBR is highly wear resistant and maintains 
its shape to provide excellent performance 
characteristics. Its resistance to aging further 
extends the service life of the seal.

Lubrication
For the SKF heavy-duty spherical plain 
bearing system, SKF recommends one  
of following greases († table 1):
• high performance LGHB 2 grease
• biodegradable LGGB 2 grease
The grease you choose depends on the  
application and the operating conditions.
For standard applications, SKF recommends using LGHB 2 grease. This grease, 
which has been proven to have superior 
mechanical stability, also has excellent antioxidation and anti-corrosion properties.  
For these bearings, LGHB 2 grease provides 
a significant increase in bearing service life 
(† diagram 4) and can further extend 
maintenance intervals.
LGGB 2 grease is the first biodegradable 
grease suitable for heavily loaded and demanding bearing ­applications, as it exhibits 
similar performance characteristics as an EP 
grease, such as SKF LGEP 2 († diagram 4).
Even if the service life is satisfactory, 
LGGB 2 should be considered as an alternative for relubrication in applications where 
polluting the environment is a concern.
Prior to switching from one grease to another in an existing machine, check that the 
two greases are compatible.
For applications with very specific requirements or unique operating conditions, such 
as chemical exposure or permanent, small 
oscillations, other special greases may be 
required. 
For additional information about greases, 
contact the SKF application engineering 
service.
Benefits of the SKF 
heavy-duty system
Heavy-duty steel/steel spherical plain bearings with an LS heavy-duty seal were developed for applications that must operate reliably in highly contaminated environments. 
Typical applications where the SKF heavyduty system is used:
• agricultural and forestry equipment
• construction and earthmoving equipment
• mining and conveying equipment
• material handling machinery
• steel mills
• railway vehicles
• linkages and rod ends
• other similar applications
Whether in development, design, production 
or operation, the SKF heavy-duty spherical 
plain bearing system provides a number  
of benefits:
• More compact sealing arrangements 
with fewer components
Due to the high performance characteristics of the LS triple-lip seal and protective 
steel insert, external sealing arrangements can be simplified or omitted. 
• Fewer surfaces to be finished
Because SKF spherical plain bearings 
have integral seals, there is no need to 
machine or grind a seal counterface on 
adjacent components.
• Improved reliability under severe 
operating conditions
High-performance greases, combined 
with the highly engineered design of the 
LS heavy-duty seal, provide extended 
bearing service life.
• Reduced downtime
The multi-groove system and highly- 
efficient seal extend the service life of the 
grease, enabling extended relubrication 
intervals. 
• Reduced unplanned downtime
In particularly difficult applications where 
high levels of contamination are the cause 
of premature bearing failure, the heavyduty system can significantly reduce unplanned downtime.
1)	Grease biologically degradable, for use in applications where strict ecological demands must be met and where 
lubrication cannot be dispensed with.

• Upgrade existing machines for more 
demanding applications
The boundary dimensions of SKF spher­
ical plain bearings are in accordance with 
ISO and ANSI standards and are dimensionally interchangeable with standard 
products that meet those specifications.
• Protect the environment 
SKF LGGB 2 helps to reduce environmental 
impact. This highly effect­ive grease is biodegradable and provides similar, and in 
some cases better, performance than an 
EP grease.
Reduce system costs by 30%
Compare two rocking lever designs. Fig. 5 
shows a conventional arrangement with an 
external sealing arrangement. Fig. 6 shows 
an arrangement using an SKF spherical 
plain bearing with integral LS heavy-duty 
seals. With the SKF heavy-duty system, designers can save up to 30% of the system 
cost († diagram 5), while maintaining the 
same performance level.
The potential for similar savings in other 
designs depends on the specific requirements.
The assortment
Bearings
Spherical plain bearings in the GE, GEH, 
GEM and GEZ series are ­available with LS 
heavy-duty seals.
SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearings are made of high grade carbon 
chro­mium steel that has been hardened, 
ground and phosphated. The sliding surfaces 
are treated with a running-in lubricant but 
have to be lubricated before use. The outer 
ring is intentionally fractured at a given point, 
so that it can be sprung apart to enable the 
inner ring to be inserted. The bearings are 
non-separable.
Greases
SKF recommends either LGHB 2 or LGGB 2 
grease for use with the SKF heavy-duty system. These greases are available in the following pack sizes:
• 125 ml cartridge unit for the SKF 
System 24 automatic lubricator 
• 420 ml cartridge for grease guns
• 5 kg and 18 kg cans
• 50 kg and 180 kg drums
Additional information about SKF’s wide  
assortment of lubricants, lubrication de­vices, 
and tools for mounting and dismounting can 
be found in the SKF catalogue MP3000 
“SKF Maintenance and Lubrication 
Products”.
