●Needle Roller Cages for Big End
●Needle Roller Cages for Small End
■Structure and Features
IKO Needle Roller Cages for Engine Connecting 
Rods are bearings for use in engine connecting rods. 
These bearings have superior performance proven in 
high performance engines of racing motor cycles, and 
are widely used in small motor vehicles, motor cycles, 
outboard marines, snow mobiles, high-speed compressors, etc. and also in general-purpose engines.
Bearings for engine connecting rods are used under 
extremely severe and complex operating conditions 
such as heavy shock loads, high speeds, high temperatures and stringent lubrication.
Needle Roller Cages for Engine Connecting Rods are 
lightweight, and have high load ratings and high rigidity as well as superior wear resistance to withstand 
these severe conditions.

The identification number of Needle Roller Cages for 
Engine Connecting Rods consists of a model code, 
dimensions and any supplemental codes as shown 
below.
■Identification Number
The diameter tolerances of needle rollers of Needle 
Roller Cages for Engine Connecting Rods are classified as shown in Table 2.  When the classification 
symbol is not indicated in the identification number, 
the classification symbol "B2" is applied.
The tolerance of the cage width Bc is −0.2 〜−0.4 
mm.  But cages with marks in the Bc column in the 
dimension tables are manufactured with the following 
width tolerances.
　　●：0 〜−0.2 mm　　　■：−0.1 〜−0.3 mm
■Accuracy
Needle Roller Cages for Big End   KT…EG
These roller cages are subjected to acceleration and 
deceleration during their rotating and epicyclic motion 
due to crank shaft rotation.  To withstand such conditions, they are made of a special alloy and are lightweight with high rigidity.
They are guided on their outer periphery surface with 
superior lubricating properties.  
For the purpose of using them under severe conditions such as high rotational speed and stringent lubrication, bearings plated with non-ferrous metals are 
also available on request.
High-load capacity and high-rigidity cages to be used 
for racing motor cycles (See the photo bellow.), split 
needle cages for solid (one-piece) type crank-shafts 
and other special specification cages of various types 
are also available.  Please consult IKO when 
required.
Needle Roller Cages for Small End   KTV…EG
These roller cages oscillates at high speeds within a 
limited loading zone under heavy shock loads.  Thus, 
these cages are designed to be lightweight and have 
high rigidity with a well-balanced structure.  In these 
cages, a number of needle rollers having a small 
diameter are incorporated to reduce the rolling contact stress in the loading zone.
Needle Roller Cages for Small End are classified into 
two types, the outer surface guide type and the inner 
surface guide type.  This classification is shown in the 
table of dimensions.
In the outer surface guide type, the cage is guided by 
the sliding contact between the inner surface of the 
connecting rod and the outer surface of the cage.
In the inner surface guide type, the cage is guided by 
the sliding contact between the outer surface of the 
pin and the inner surface of the cage.

■Clearance
Radial internal clearances are selected according to 
the type of engine and the operating conditions (rotational speed, load, lubricating conditions, etc.).  If a 
bearing is used with an inadequate clearance, bearing 
troubles such as seizure, early flaking and noise 
increase may occur, leading to an engine failure. 
Therefore, it is necessary to select the clearance 
carefully according to test results and experience.

unit: μ m
■Fit
To obtain the recommended clearance shown in 
Table 3, it is general practice to match a connecting 
rod, crank pin or piston pin and needle roller cage of 
suitable tolerances for assembly.
■Precautions for Use
Fig.1
When designing a connecting rod, crank pin and piston pin, the following precautions should be taken, 
because the raceways are subjected to loads under 
extremely severe conditions.
1  Material
It is recommended to use carburizing steel because 
the raceways are subjected to fluctuating loads with 
frequent and heavy shock loads.  Generally, chromium molybdenum steel is used.  Nickel chromium 
molybdenum steel is also used.
2  Hardness
The recommended surface hardness of the raceway 
is 697〜800HV (60〜64HRC).  While the effective 
hardening depth differs depending on the applications, the general value is 0.6〜1.2 mm.
3  Surface roughness
To minimize initial wear and to extend life, it is recommended that the surface roughness of the crank pin 
and piston pin be 0.1μmRa or less, and the surface 
roughness of the connecting rod large end and small 
end bores be 0.2μmRa or less.
4  Accuracy
Circularity and cylindricity of connecting rod, piston 
pin and crank pin are as shown in Table 4. 
5  Parallelism and torsional accuracy of connecting rod bores
L±0.02 mm and E±0.02 mm shown in Fig. 1 indicate the parallelism and torsional accuracy between 
the big end and small end bores of the connecting 
rod, respectively.  The tolerance range is 0.04 mm or 
less per 100 mm in case of a general-purpose engine 
and 0.02 mm or less for a high-speed engine such as 
a racing motorcycle engine.  When these accuracy 
conditions are not satisfied, the axial forces on the 
needle roller cage and connecting rod will increase, 
directly leading to a failure such as seizure.  Careful 
consideration is required.
Recommended radial internal clearances are shown 
in Table 3.  When operating at high speeds, it is recommended to select the upper limit of the clearance.
