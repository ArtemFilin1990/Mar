Special-Alloy Stainless Steel
In collaboration with the steel industry, 
Rexnord has developed a special heat treated 
alloy of chrome steel with nickel. This results 
in excellent strength properties, as well as 
improved corrosion-resistance.
The most outstanding properties of Rex-OPTIPlus ® are its high resistance to wear, its 
ground finish, and 40% higher strength.
In addition no "break in" is required thus 
insuring maximum performance from startup. 
Rex-OPTI-Plus ® is the preferred choice for 
new or replacement installations.
Longer sliding wear life, reduced chain 
elongation, lowest available friction. The 
continuous search of Rexnord for 
improvement of their product has resulted in 
the development of a new, patentd, material: 
Rex HP™ High Performance.
This new material has the lowest coefficient of 
friction, available on the market. 
This material is especially suitable for 
applications, where external lubrification is not 
possible.
Operating temperature of Rex HP™ material:
in air (- 40 to + 80 °C)
in hot water (+ 65 °C)
Colour: dark grey.
Rex HP™ high performance resin can 
increase wear life up to 40%. Extensive 
testing has proven that new HP material can 
reduce wear as much as 40% over acetal and 
25% over Rex LF ®  acetal
New technology virtually eliminates break-in 
stretch and reduces elongation due to wear.
Through extensive testing, Rexnord has 
achieved the optimum design to minimize 
break-in wear while maximizing overall 
performance.

The higher demands placed on modern high-performance lines 
with regard to efficiency, safety and noise reduction led logically to 
the development of a new generation of sideflexing chains for:
• chains with bevelled guide shoes
• chains with hold-down tabs.
Its flatness and surface quality with circumferential chamfer as well 
as its distortion-free welding make this chain especially suitable for 
pressureless combiners.
The altered position and design of the hold-down tabs produce a 
self-cleaning effect and considerable increased stability.

With Steel Top Plates
The sideflexing plate top chain utilizes the advantage of a precision 
built base roller chain with "snap on" top plates to form a 
continuous flat conveying surface.
Hold-down tabs are used to provide positive retention in curves and 
inclines.
A special version, the 4874 chain, is also available with angled top 
plates on one side. Although this chain can only sideflex to one 
side, the special top plates minimize the flight gap opening.

New Rex CurveMaster™ sideflexing chains with the exclusive 
LPC™ design can be lifted out in curves and straights for easy 
cleaning and conveyor maintenance.
The LPC™ system features Low Pin Centerline chains and 
wearstrips that hold CurveMaster chains down in corners, without 
the restrictions of tabs, bevels, or magnets. LPC™ chain stays flat 
and level in corners, eliminating product tippage.
When power is removed, CurveMaster™ chains can be easily 
lifted out in corners and straights.

A roller chain ANSI 40 (pitch 12,7 mm) is used as base chain. 
The  top plates (which are replaceable) are clipped on the  
protruding pins. 
They have a greater loading capacity, permit higher speed and 
longer runs with a single power traction unit. The small pitch 
reduces the sagging effect and permits the use of smaller  
sprockets. They are recommended for step-to-step positioning.
They produce lower gearing noise.
Series 843.  Uni-directional travel.
Series 845. They differ from the 843 for the bevelling of the plate 
edges, which facilitate longitudinal and lateral movements. 
Bi-directional travel. 
It is recommended for conveying the new 202 type tins. These tins 
used to create the problem of head transfer jamming: problem 
which was particularly evident in  the heat shrinking tunnels in  
Wrap-Round systems.

Dimensional characteristics of the conveyor: 
The chain features a system of guides designed for modular assembly. The system 
of modular assembling of the intermediate straight guides (see 35 RT 327) permits the 
realisation of conveyors of different lengths depending on the number of guides used.
It is possible to assemble a maximum of 11straight guides.
According to the span (I) and the rise required (H), the table gives: 
-  number of straight guides (35RT327) to be used.
-  length (L). 
-  total length of the chain.
Example: to design a conveyor with span I = 8196 mm and rise H = 2603 mm, is 
necessary to use No. 5 straight guides (35RT327). The corresponding length L is 7500 
mm, and the total length of the chain is 17863 mm.

Rubber-Top
Straight Running
The Rubber-Top chain 35RTK1700 is especially developed for 
inclined conveyors for crates, trays and boxes.
The rigid slats of the chain have a vulcanized, specially shaped 
surface to ensure maximum grip. The system is designed for an 
inclination of 20 degrees and a max difference in height of 5,7 mtrs.
For proper function of this chain special kits for support are 
available.

Legend..
The data shown in this table.. 
are taken from laboratory tests, performed on unstrained test 
samples. It  should be considered as purely indicative since material 
behaviour under real working conditions depends on different 
factors: temperature, concentration of the chemical agent, quick or 
long-lasting effect of the chemical agent.
Abbreviations: Sat. = saturated.
+ = Good resistance.
/  = Fairly good resistance (limited use depending on working 
conditions).
– = Poor resistance (not recommended).
