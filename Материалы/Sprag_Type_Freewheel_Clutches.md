GMN Sprag type freewheel clutches


55
The standardized model series offer a large selection of feature options to furnish effective freewheel-clutch solutions for almost any 
field of application.
Based on its many years of experience in the development and production of high-quality machine components, GMN has chosen to 
specialize, within the field of freewheel-clutches, in the production 
of efficient, long-life sprag type freewheel clutches. 
Emphasis is placed on the highest precision in the development 
and production of GMN sprag type freewheel clutches. This ensures their certification to international standards and produces 
consistent, outstanding quality characteristics with respect to 
torque handling, indexing reliability and long service life.


Freewheel clutches are machine elements which permit rotation 
in one direction (idle) and stop rotation or transmit torque in the 
opposite direction. 
Spring system
The sprags are spring-loaded to ensure constant friction contact 
between the sprags and the rings.
The sprags slide on the rotating raceway surfaces of the rings 
(sliding friction) in the idle direction.
Torque is not transmitted from the driving side to the driven side 
under these conditions. 
Gap height
The inner and outer rings define a constant gap height h0 (start 
gap) in which the sprags slide over the raceways in the idle direction.

Idle direction
Driving/driven side
Force transfer takes place from the driving side to the driven side. 
Torque can be applied as desired, via the outer ring or the inner ring. 


Backstop
A Backstop application is where rotation 
is allowed in one direction and stopped in 
the opposite.  
Indexing clutch
A repeated drive then idle motion will 
be transferred to the driven side, step by 
step, as rotary motion in one direction (the 
clamping direction).
Overrunning clutch
If the speed of the driven side exceeds the 
speed of the driving side, the freewheelclutch disengages the driving and driven 
sides by switching from torque transmit 
to idle.
All GMN Freewheel clutches can be used for backstop, indexing or 
for overrunning clutch applications.
When rotating the clutch in the driving direction, the sprags will 
instantaneously engage to drive the races/rings in the desired 
direction. This instantaneous engagement is a result of static 
friction contact with the raceways because of the specifically designed clamping curve. Torque could be transmitted through the 
sprags now.
Angle of twist and torque transfer
As the force transfer increases, the sprags become more upright 
and expand the distance between the steel rings. This increased 
gap height is represented by h, and lies within the elastic deformation of the materials. The rings rotate with respect to each 
other in the amount of angle .
The rotation of the sprags ends when a balance of forces is established between the applied torque and the reaction forces exerted in the freewheel clutch. Subsequently the force is transmitted 
to the driven side.
The angle of twist  is necessary to build up the balance of forces.
If the direction of rotation changes from the clamping direction 
to the idle direction, the system turns back in the opposite direction and the angle of twist reverses to the idle or start position. 
The rotation back and forth of the sprags from the driving to idle 
positions occur with a high degree of repeatability and precision.

Sprags
The compact size of these sprags in combination with their highly 
precise production geometry result in outstanding performance 
characteristics. 
Clamping angle and clamping curve: The specific shape of the 
clamping curve along the sprags` inner and outer race defines 
in contact with the round mating parts (shaft and housing) the 
clamping angle .
Sprag series 400
Sprag series 8000
The small sprag size permits high sprag 
density and thus maximum performance 
in a minimum of space. The low inertia of 
sprags also makes it possible to achieve 
extremely high indexing frequencies of 
up to 60 Hz.

To achieve maximum torque capacity with 
the larger 8000 series sprag the profile 
was adjusted with a slightly higher clamping angle. Due to the center of gravity´s 
position the design is not lifting off and 
provides indexing reliability even in high 
speed applications.

Clamping angle
The correct function of the sprag relies on a specific clamping angle. 

 As long as the tangent of the clamping angle is smaller than the 
coefficient of static friction µ, the sprags will be in static friction 
contact with the connecting parts when load is applied.
Material:
Bearing steel  100Cr6 (material number: 1.3505)
Hardness: HRC = 60+4 (HV = 700+100)
Mating parts:
The geometry of the clamping curve is designed for steel mating parts 
– raceways in other materials are not permissible.
µ > tan 
µ = static friction coefficient
 = clamping angle


Sprag cage
The sprags are evenly spaced around the circumference of the 
insert element cage.  The insert element cage does not come in 
contact with the inner or outer races; it remains absolutely load 
free under any application.
GMN Sprag type freewheel clutches with a plastic cage in their 
standard design are also available as a special design with a 
steel cage on request.
Steel cage: max. 170°C
Plastic cage: max. 140°C
Spring
GMN offers two different spring systems which maintain a constant friction contact between sprags and the mating parts. 
Tension spring
The GMN tension spring is a circular spring that envelopes all of 
the sprags and provides them with a collective spring force.
The spring force per sprag is slightly less than that of a meander 
spring. 
This results in a longer service life in idle.
The max. indexing frequency is fmax = 10 Hz.

Meander spring
A 3-dimensionally bent spring that loads each sprag separately 
(individual spring force for each sprag). 
The structural characteristics of this spring increases transferable 
torque by about 10% (in comparison to tension springs) because 
maximum sprag line contact to race is achieved.
The max. indexing frequency is fmax = 60 Hz.

Rings
GMN Freewheel clutch rings are made of hardened and ground 
ball bearing steel.
Press fit installation
The thin wall thickness (2–2.5 mm) of the rings for press fit permits installation within a limited space requirement.  The rings are 
designed to achieve the optimal start gap height (h0) only after 
the rings are pressed into the housing and onto the shaft (see 
tolerance tables). Press fit installation guarantees transmission of 
maximum torque capacity.
Keyway installation
All GMN rings with a keyway are designed for light press fit to support torque transfer. A key connection alone without a press fit will 
be insufficient to achieve maximum torque transfer.

Ball bearings
Roller bearings
GMN Ball bearing freewheel clutch units and complete freewheel 
clutch units have standard ball bearings integrated. 
The rings each have a ground-in ball bearing raceway and form a 
unit with the balls, which cannot be disassembled.
The ball bearing raceways for all inner and outer rings are individually measured and paired. 
Bearing clearance between C3 and C5 is established according 
to the tolerance fields of the mating parts after press-fitting the 
freewheel clutch.
Minimum bearing clearance C3 is achieved with the largest dimension of the shaft's diameter and the smallest dimension of 
the bore diameter (housing).

Sprag Type Freewheel Clutches
Torque


21
Torque development
As the force transfer increases in driving direction, the sprags become more upright and expand the clamping gap between the 
rings elastically.
When nominal gap height hnom is reached, the freewheel clutch 
will transmit its nominal torque Tnom; at the maximum gap height 
hmax its maximum torque Tmax.
---- Torque development for optimal start gap h0. 
---- Torque development for start gap h > h0. 

The gradient of the graph remains unchanged, nominal and 

maximum torque are reduced. 
Torque limit
· A load-dependent stress reaction is built up in the sprags and the 
	 mating parts. 
· The linear contact of the sprags along the clamping curves with 
	 the mating parts is evaluated according to the Hertzian model. 
· The sprags expand the gap. Maximum gap height is determined 
	 by the geometry of sprags.
The freewheel clutch's nominal and maximum torque are defined 
by reaching one of the relevant limits.
Stresses
Sprags as well as the rings are loaded in the contact area by tangential and radial stress.
Bending stresses BS perm. is valid as an equivalent stress for this 
load.
Yield strength Re is the applicable load limit for all other components in press fits.
Freewheel clutches in a row
Rough calculation of the torque capacity for a maximum of 3 
freewheel clutches in a row:
· 2 freewheel clutches in a row: 
	 90% of the sum of individual torque capacity
· 3 freewheel clutches in a row: 
	 80% of the sum of individual torque capacity
The maximum gap height (hmax) is a consequence of the sprag geometry.

Nominal torque
The nominal torque (Tnom) (size tables Pg. 24–55) describes the 
torque that the freewheel clutch can transfer as a continuous load. 
The calculation of nominal torque is based on a standardized surrounding construction.

Torque


23
Maximum torque
If the load exceeds the specified nominal torque (Tnom) the clamping angle changes and rises steeply to increase gap height to its 
maximum permissible dimension (hmax).
Depending on type and surrounding construction, the maximum 
torque (Tmax) is 1.5 to 2 times the specified nominal torque. 
Please note that maximum torque capacity cannot be transferred 
in continuous operation.
Overload protection
If the applied torque exceeds the maximum permissible value 
(Tmax), statical friction contact is loosened between the sprags and 
the rings and the clutch slips.
Drag torque
In idle direction the freewheel clutch shows only a very low drag 
torque to overcome the sliding friction be­tween sprags and the rings.
Drag torque is increased in sealed freewheel clutches: 
ball bearing free­wheel clutch units, Ts = 0.01 to 0.05 Nm.
complete freewheel clutch units, Ts = 0.1 to 0.3 Nm
Torque calculation
The GMN calculation program determines specific nominal torque 
with consideration for all influencing factors.
The analysis of a given surrounding construction can reveal optimization potential for mating parts, provide performance enhancing design advisories and offer support in the selection of a suitable freewheel-clutch.

Speed Limits
Theoretically, freewheel clutches have no speed limit during torque 
transfer. However, in idle and overrun operation the influence of centrifugal forces must be considered.
Series 400
The influence of centrifugal force
Spring force produces a torque Fs, which rotates the sprags and 
maintains constant friction contact with the mating parts.
During rotation an opposing torque FZsZ is imposed by centrifugal 
force.
When the opposing torque becomes greater than the torque created by the spring, the sprags will lift off the inner raceway. A reliable indexing process is no longer possible under these conditions. 
Decisive for this effect is the freewheel clutch insert element's inherent speed.

Inherent speed of the freewheel clutch insert element
Inherent speed of the freewheel clutch insert element cannot be 
precisely predetermined because the freewheel clutch insert element is only in friction contact (sliding friction) with the mating 
parts. The freewheel clutch insert element will never rotate completely with the turning part, nor will it completely adhere to the 
standing part; a difference in speed will always occur.
The rotation speed limits provided in the diagram and size tables 
describe the inherent speed of freewheel clutch insert elements, 
they do not describe the maximum rotation speed of the shaft or 
hub. These values serve as a means to estimate whether centrifugal influences might have an effect.
For example, a critical operational state can be reached when the 
freewheel clutch is currently transferring torque and is then accelerated beyond the rotation speed limit. If the freewheel clutch 
is then disengaged, the sprags will lift off and lose contact with 
the raceway. A subsequent indexing process is only then possible 
if the rotation speed of the freewheel clutch insert element is 
once more reduced to below the lifting-off speed.
Freewheel clutches with seals
The maximum permissible rotation speed of all sealed freewheel 
clutchess is limited, not by centrifugal force but rather by the friction and heat generated at the seal. 
In these cases, the rotation speed limit specified in the size tables 
is the maximum permissible difference speed of mating parts.
Series 8000
The sprag profile for our 8000 series is a non lift-off design, i.e. 
at high rotation speeds centrifugal force will produce a pressing 
torque on the sprags because of their altered center of gravity (in 
comparison to series 400 sprags). Series 8000 freewheel clutch 
insert elements therefore have no rotation speed limit.

Freewheel clutch insert elements
FE 400 M / FE 400 Z / FE 400 Z2
GMN Freewheel clutch insert elements assembly units are built 
symmetrically and can be installed for a left or right clamping 
direction. All freewheel clutch insert elements are delivered on a 
packaging tube to protect them against damage. This tube can 
also be used as an installation aid.
If possible, mating parts should be chamfered to improve installation: installation chamfer for shaft and housing: 1 x 30°
FE 400 M
As an additional protective measure for the sprag, a rubber ring 
is stretched around the freewheel clutch insert element of type 
series  FE 400 M.
Installation is performed by pushing the freewheel directly from 
the packing tube onto the shaft and into the hub. The freewheel can 
be completely pushed in after the rubber ring has been removed.
FE 400 Z installation with chamfer
The freewheel clutch is first positioned in the hub, the chamfered 
shaft can then be inserted with a turning motion in the idle direction.
FE 400 Z installation without chamfer (tilted) 
If the shaft is not chamfered, the freewheel clutch insert element 
should be pushed halfway onto the end of the shaft so that the 
sprags are slightly tilted. 
This reduces the outer diameter of the freewheel clutch insert element enough to allow the shaft to be inserted together with the 
freewheel with a turning motion in the idle direction.

Providing freewheels with an adequate supply of GMN selected 
lubricants ensures correct performance and a long service life. 
GMN Freewheel clutches are suitable for oil or grease lubrication. 
Corrosion protection
All GMN Freewheel clutches without seals are delivered with an 
effective corrosion protection and have to be greased by customer. 
Lifetime pre-lubrication
GMN offers complete freewheel clutch units and ball bearing freewheel clutch units sealed on both sides with operative 
lifetime lubrication. 
GMN Complete freewheel clutch units: 
Series FPD, FND and RA
GMN Ball bearing freewheel clutch units: 
Series FK 2RS, FKN 2RS, FKNN 2RS
The lubricant qualities and quantities selected by GMN ensure 
unrestricted capability for the freewheel clutch over its entire 
service lifetime. 
Further lubrication (re-lubrication) for freewheel clutches with 
Lifetime pre-lubrication is not necessary.
Special solutions
Custom solutions for reliable lubrication under exceptional operating conditions, extreme operating temperatures or for vertical 
installation position applications are possible on request. 
Notes: 
An insufficient supply of lubricant, deviating lubricant qualities 
or the use of lubricants with friction reducing additives (such as 
MoS2 or graphite, for example) can cause serious functional impairments or damage the freewheel clutches.
The use of lubricants from other manufacturers which have 
equivalent compositions is possible.
The compositions and characteristics of the specified lubricants 
can change due to technical advances and may necessitate retesting with respect to lubricant qualification for GMN freewheel clutches.
All specifications reflect conditions as of the time of printing in 
June 2013.
Oil bath or oil mist lubrication is particularly well suited for high 
operating requirements with respect to rotation speeds and indexing frequencies. 
Service life oil lubrication
GMN Complete freewheel clutch units: 
Series FPD, FND and RA with GMN rubber seals
GMN Complete freewheel clutch units are sealed on both sides 
and have lifetime oil lubrication (Shell Tellus S2 MA 32) suitable 
for operating temperatures from 15 ºC to 90 ºC.
Other oil types for different temperature ranges are available on 
request.
Oil bath lubrication
Adequate pre-lubrication and re-lubrication is necessary for freewheel clutches in open housings. Such lubrication must accommodate the given freewheel clutch size and the structural characteristics of the mating parts. 
For horizontal installation positions, the freewheel clutch should 
be about 1/3 submerged in the oil bath when at state of rest.
Oil mist lubrication 
Hydraulic oils HM 10 and HM 32 are suitable for oil mist lubrication with respect to operating temperature. 
Oil mist lubricated applications are based on a constant supply of 
sufficient fresh oil during operation. 
1) Lubricants of the given oil type can be mixed.
Mixing combinations of different oil types is not permissible.
Lubricant qualification
Selected common commercial motor oils are suitable for reliable 
re-lubrication.
HD motor oils SAE 10 W or SAE 30 conform to "API SF/CC" as well 
as "MIL-L46152B". 


1361
Grease lubrication
Economically efficient grease lubrication is sufficient for ordinary 
performance requirements. 
Grease types are distinguished by special characteristics which, 
because of their specific composition, fundamentally make them 
differ from one another.
The selection of a suitable grease is to be made on the basis of 
specific operating conditions.  
Lubricant qualification
GMN has chosen suitable grease types for differing operating 
conditions from DIN 51818 consistency classes NLGI 1 and NLGI 2.
Service life grease lubrication
GMN Ball bearing freewheel clutch units: 
Series FK 2RS, FKN 2RS, FKNN 2RS with RS seals
The lubricating grease chosen by GMN for greasing sealed ball 
bearing freewheel clutches (Klüber ISOFLEX LDS 18 Special A) is 
intended for applications under normal operating conditions. 
Other grease types for different operational conditions are available on request. 
Pre- and re-lubrication
Adequate pre-lubrication and re-lubrication are necessary for 
freewheel clutches in open housings. Such lubrication must accommodate the given freewheel clutches size and the structural 
characteristics of mating parts. All-over distribution of an adequate amount of grease (about 30–60% of the available volume 
in the freewheel) ensures an adequate lubricating effect. 
Too much grease can result in functional failures at low temperatures.

Service Life
Applications
Backstop
A Backstop application is where rotation is allowed in one direction 
and stopped in the opposite direction.
Application examples:
· Conveyor equipment
· Mixers
· High voltage switches
· Furniture industry
· Turnstiles and revolving doors
· Geared motors
· Winches
· Elevators
· Cranes
· Strap/belt tighteners
· Bucket conveyors
· Belt reversing locks
· Fans
· Automatic doors (subway)
· Fire damper flaps
· Aviation technology
· Roller plants
· Summer skiing
etc.
GMN Freewheel clutches are the result of setting maximum demands on materials and processing in order to achieve the longest 
possible service life.
However, the basic functionality of freewheel clutches cause material stresses which result in a limit on service life.
Idle operation
The constant friction contact of sprags with mating parts during 
idle operation causes material wear which limits the service life of 
sprag type freewheel clutches.
Freewheel clutches with a tension spring offer outstanding operating conditions for applications with high idle operation rotation 
speed requirements (backstops, overrunning clutches).
Indexing operation
Torque-dependent distortion forces (Hertzian pressures) act on 
relevant freewheel clutch components during indexing operation 
and these lead to material fatigue over the long-term.
In particular, applications in which there are continuous high indexing frequencies can produce micro cracks and material chipping.
GMN has an analysis program which can project freewheel clutch 
service life under special consideration for indexing frequency and 
torque requirements.
The results of service life time calculations for specific application 
profiles are available on request.
Freewheel-clutch service life

A repeated drive and idle motion will be transformed step by step 
into rotary motion in a single direction.
Application examples:
Indexing clutch
Overrunning clutch 
· Paper processing (advance)
· Seeding machines
· Staplers (staples)
· Conveyor belts (drive)
· Ratchets
· Ratchet wrenches
· Roller advance
· Installation tools
· Automation technology
etc.
· Copier machines
· Printing machines
· Conveyor equipment
· Transport equipment (speed matching)
· Starters for combustion engines
· Ergometers
· E-bikes

· Model helicopters
· Hand operated sirens
· Roller coasters
· Washing systems
· Continuous ovens
· Compressors
· Compensating gearboxes
· Gas turbine drives
· Pump drives
· Belt drives
· Wheelchairs
etc.
If the speed of the driven side exceeds the speed of the driving 
side, the freewheel clutch disengages (drive and driven) by switching from torque transmit to idle.
