SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
INTRODUCTION
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED 
BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
Timken guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated rolling bearings, components and 
assemblies are set forth below. Shelf life information is based on test data and experience. 
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/ component design life as follows:
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
EUROPEAN REACH COMPLIANCE
Timken-branded lubricants, greases and similar products sold 
in stand-alone containers or delivery systems are subject to 
the European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, 
please contact your Timken engineer.
SHELF LIFE POLICY
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation. 
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity 
and extended storage.
Shelf life values, available from Timken, represent a maximum 
limit – and assume adherence to the Timken suggested 
storage and handling guidelines. Deviations from Timken 
storage and handling guidelines may reduce shelf life. Any 
speciﬁ cation or operating practice that deﬁ nes a shorter shelf 
life should be used. Timken cannot anticipate the performance 
of the grease lubricant after the bearing or component is 
installed or placed in service.


INTRODUCTION
6  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
 • The storage area should be kept free from airborne 
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, 
harmful vapors, etc.
 • The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration.
 • Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Upon receipt of a bearing shipment, ensure that the bearings 
are not removed from their packaging until they are ready 
for mounting so that they do not become corroded or 
contaminated. Bearings should be stored in an appropriate 
atmosphere in order that they remain protected for the 
intended period.
Any questions concerning shelf life or storage should be 
directed to your local sales ofﬁ ce.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for its 
ﬁ nished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
hereinafter referred to as “Products”):
 •  Unless directed otherwise by Timken, Products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 • Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on the 
packaging.
 • Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 • After a Product is removed from its packaging, it should be 
placed into service as soon as possible.
 • When removing a Product that is not individually packaged from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the Product is removed.
 • Do not use Product that has exceeded its shelf life as 
deﬁ ned in Timken’s shelf life guidelines statement.
 • The storage area temperature should be maintained 
between 0º C (32º F) and 40º C (104º F); temperature 
ﬂ uctuations should be minimized.
 • The relative humidity should be maintained below 
60 percent and the surfaces should be dry.

BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
TIMKEN
® BEARINGS
Timken provides an extensive variety of rolling bearing types 
and sizes. Knowing that the bearing is often the most critical 
component within a moving assembly, Timken engineers take 
great care to ensure the customer is receiving maximum value 
when a Timken® bearing is selected. Timken provides the proper 
bearing for virtually any motion-control application. With more 
than a century of proven experience in bearing technology, 
Timken is a world leader in the rolling bearing industry.
The Timken Company has an experienced, highly skilled staff 
of trained engineers located around the world to assist the 
customer in bringing new, mechanized products to market. Timken 
engineers are a powerful resource for customers to turn to for 
assistance in the appropriate selection of bearings to meet any 
of the following considerations:
 • Higher technical demands or higher levels of application 
requirements.
 • Higher levels of application complexity.
 • Critical applications where system damage must be avoided 
for all modes of operation.
 • Potential exposure to personal injury.
 • Costly damage or downtime resulting from the use of an 
inappropriate bearing for a given task.
Because Timken offers so many bearing conﬁ gurations to serve 
a wide variety of situations, a suggested starting point in the 
selection process focuses on the assessment of two basic 
categories: the ﬁ rst being boundary (or ﬁ xed) conditions and 
the second being performance expectations (or desired results). 
Depending on your application, the boundary conditions and 
performance expectations will vary. Trade-offs or compromises 
must be addressed so that the ﬁ nal bearing type and size selected 
are a reasonable balance of all factors. It is a wise practice to 
examine factors critical to the success of the device and prioritize 
them. 
Boundary (or fixed) conditions that should be taken into
consideration include:
 • External loads, including radial, thrust, moment, shock and 
combination loads.
 • Acceleration and deceleration levels.
 • Operating temperature range (including extreme limits and 
thermal cycling).
 • Other environmental factors, such as humidity, ﬂ uids, 
vibration, debris, magnetic ﬁ elds and vacuum.
 • Spatial constraints.
Performance expectations (or desired results) to consider include:
 • Rotational accuracy and repeatability (e.g., service 
precision level).
 • System rigidity (axial or radial stiffness).
 • Application service life.
 • Speed.
Looking at the key operating parameters of the system will help 
focus on the most viable bearing solution. 
Typical considerations in application design include optimization 
of controllable variables affecting application performance:
 • Bearing design. 
 • Bearing shaft and housing arrangement; shaft and housing 
material. 
 • Installation and handling requirements of the bearing, as 
well as shaft and housing preparation. 
 • Presence of adequate sealing for the exclusion of contaminants; types of foreign materials possible. 
 • Lubricating method (lubrication type and delivery system).
 • Maintenance procedures and intervals.
Once these conditions and expectations are identified and 
prioritized, the most appropriate bearing type(s), size(s), and 
part number(s) that meet the basic application requirements 
can be selected.

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  9
CATALOG PRODUCT SELECTION
CATALOG PRODUCT SELECTION
Timken produces precision bearings and assemblies in miniature and thin-section series. The 
bearings are manufactured with quality steel, tolerances and features that meet demanding 
application challenges. These precision bearings and assemblies are found in surgical and 
diagnostic imaging devices, precision pumps, measurement and material handling equipment, 
as well as guidance, weapons and space applications. Standard sizes range from 0.025 in. to 11 
in. bore (1 mm to 280 mm bore).
Typical applications use preloaded pairs for maximum stiffness, 
high speeds and precise positioning. These include surgical 
handpieces, control-moment gyros and other high-speed or 
high-stiffness applications. Available as a single bearing or 
preloaded duplex pair.
FRACTURED-RACE 
BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.3750 in. - 3.0625 in.
These bearings have outer rings that 
are radially fractured in one location. 
This permits the race to be opened 
for complete ﬂ exibility in the choice 
of ball complement and separator 
in a deep-groove radial bearing.
High-strength stainless-steel holding bands are pressed on the 
ground shoulders to maintain tight abutment and alignment of the 
fractured surface during handling. Full complement and several 
retainer options are available. 
Typical applications have a limited radial cross section and a 
limited axial width. These applications require a bearing with 
maximum radial capacity, as well as some axial capacity in both 
directions. Contact Timken engineering for more information.

ball bearing. 
Fig. 1. Radial ball 
bearing. 
Fig. 2. Angular-contact 
ball bearing.
RADIAL BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0250 in. - 11.0000 in.
These deep-groove (Conrad) bearings
allow for handling of radial, thrust in two 
directions, or combination of loads. The 
deep-groove bearings are produced 
to ABEC 5 - ABEC 7 precision levels as 
standard catalog offering. These are 
offered primarily with 440C stainlesssteel rings and balls with a variety of separator types. In 
addition, other material options are available, as well as 
shields and seals, and ceramic or titanium carbide-coated 
balls. Radial ball bearings are the only bearings offered as 
a standard with two seals or shields. Flanges are offered 
on miniature product. Typical applications include guidance 
systems, medical (surgical instruments and devices) and robotic 
joints. Available as a single bearing or preloaded duplex pair.
ANGULAR-CONTACT 
BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0250 in. - 11.0000 in.
Angular-contact ball bearings offer 
maximum ball complement for 
additional load capacity and axial 
stiffness. These angular-contact 
bearings allow for handling of radial,
thrust in one direction, or a combination 
of loading. The one-piece precision
machined retainer provides higher speed capability. Angularcontact bearings are manufactured to the same tolerances 
and standards as the radial ball bearings. Rings and balls are 
normally 440C stainless steel, but other material options are 
offered. Steel and ceramic balls are available as standard.

SPECIAL PRODUCTS
INTEGRAL ASSEMBLIES
Timken designs and produces specialized integral assemblies. 
These assemblies utilize precision bearings that are mated 
with components manufactured to extremely tight tolerances 
or contain bearing raceways integrated into the shaft and/or 
housing. By avoiding tolerance stack-ups, integral assemblies 
provide the ultimate bearing solution for critical applications 
requiring precise positional control and low radial/axial runout. 
Integral designs have the added beneﬁ ts of mounting ease and 
more value to the user.
X-RAY
This bearing assembly supports the rotating anode in an X-raygenerating vacuum tube. To meet the severe operating conditions 
of 10-8 TORR vacuum, 752° F - 932° F (400° C - 500° C) and 10,000 
RPM, super high-speed steel alloys, such as M62, are required 
for bearing rings and balls. The integral shaft raceway design 
offers cost and performance advantages.   
DOUBLE-ROW AND SUPER DUPLEX BEARINGS
When two radial ball-bearing raceways are ground wider than 
standard width inner and outer rings, a double-row ball bearing 
is created.  A double-row bearing has a single piece inner ring 
and a single piece outer ring for ease of handling. Double-row 
bearings are normally supplied to an axial play speciﬁ cation 
or a radial play speciﬁ cation, and also can incorporate special 
features such as slots, ﬂ anges and holes if required.
Super duplex bearings are a special version of a double-row 
bearing, where only one ring has two raceways ground into it. 
Super duplex bearings are typically manufactured as angular- 
contact ball bearings, and can be supplied as a DB (back-to-back) 
or a DF (face-to-face) super duplex assembly.  A DB super duplex 
bearing utilizes a single outer ring with two angular-contact 
raceways, and two precisely matched inner rings to provide for 
the desired preload.  
Fig. 5. Thrust ball bearing. 
PIVOT BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0600 in. - 0.3750 in.   
Designed for space-constrained environments where low torque 
is required, pivot bearings use the mating shaft for the inner 
raceway. These bearings achieve maximum power density with a 
full complement of larger balls, no separator or inner ring. Shields 
are available for the standard line. Typical applications are in 
guidance systems, such as commercial gyroscopes. 
THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0937 in. - 0.1250 in.
These bearings are designed for applications where there is highaxial loading, low speeds and relatively high-allowable torque. 
The standard offering has all stainless-steel components for use 
where inert materials are required. Typical applications include 
fuel control systems.

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  11
CATALOG PRODUCT SELECTION
A DF super duplex bearing utilizes a single inner ring with two 
angular-contact raceways, and two precisely matched outer 
rings to provide for the desired preload. Super duplex bearings 
can be supplied with customized radial play or contact angle to 
meet speciﬁ c application conditions, and also can incorporate 
special features such as slots, ﬂ anges and holes if required. 
Double-row or super duplex bearings can be supplied as a 
cartridge bearing design. Timken uses the term cartridge bearing 
to denote the addition of inner- and outer-ring spacers, which 
results in an overall bearing assembly that is wider than two 
single-row bearings. Additional material can be added to the 
design at the bearing inner diameter (I.D.) or the bearing outer 
diameter (O.D.), resulting in thicker bearing ring cross sections 
for those applications that require a different ring thickness to 
meet special design requirements.
Integrating spacers or additional I.D. or O.D. material can offer 
distinct advantages over an assembly composed of discrete 
components (such as bearings plus spacers plus sleeves).  Some 
design advantages include lower, more consistent torque, more 
consistent preload, improved running accuracy, and simpliﬁ ed 
installation.  As with super duplex assemblies, cartridge bearings 
can be supplied with any desired preload, with customized radial 
play or contact angle to meet speciﬁ c application conditions, 
and they also can incorporate special features such as slots, 
ﬂ anges and holes.     
GIMBAL ASSEMBLIES
Precision grinding, machining and assembly capabilities along 
with the latest in bearing technology are combined to produce 
gimbal assemblies. Participation in design, prototype and 
production efforts enables Timken to supply hardware at all 
levels including bearings, component parts, subassemblies and 
assemblies. These mechanical assemblies are routinely built 
with gimbal axis and spin axis intersection tolerances of less 
than 0.0002 in. and in some instances include optical components. 
HYBRID BEARINGS
In applications where marginal lubrication, high speed and heat 
are factors, Timken hybrid bearings may perform signiﬁ cantly 
better than all steel bearings. Ceramic or coated rolling elements 
can reduce wear of the raceway in marginally lubricated 
contacts. In high-speed applications, the lower density of silicon 
nitride reduces centrifugal forces of the balls on the outer race. 
Timken bearings may be ordered with either Silicon Nitride balls 
or Titanium-Carbide-coated steel balls in combination with 440C 
or 52100 steel rings. Hybrid bearings are currently used in many 
applications including gyro spin and gimbal applications, aircraft 
accessory and dental handpieces.
FOUR-POINT CONTACT (GOTHIC ARCH)
BEARINGS
The four-point contact bearing (raceway) consists of two true 
radius arcs with equally offset centers from the race centerline. 
With this construction, a single four-point contact ball bearing 
performs in many ways as if it were two bearings combined into 
one. By creating an X pattern of ball contact, a single bearing 
can deﬁ ne both radial and axial shaft location. Four-point contact 
bearings are attractive options on a variety of applications where 
space is limited and it is desirable to control axial play, resist 
overturning moments, or contain thrust in two directions. Among 
the mechanisms that commonly use this bearing are rotary tables, 
radar systems and material handling robots.

MPS 160 multiplying encoder ASIC   
The MPS 160, or advanced multiplying encoder ASIC, offers 
design engineers an alternative to delicate optical sensors 
and expensive resolvers. The fully integrated Timken design 
features on-chip Hall sensors and processing that provide 
optical encoder resolutions in a small, durable, low-cost, off-axis 
magnetic encoder package. The MPS 160 combines a directionsensing Hall Effect encoder with integrated index pulses and a 
high-accuracy resolution multiplying circuit. The result is a 
high-resolution speed and position sensor system on a chip that is 
mounted off-axis to the shaft. The ASIC produces and processes 
Hall Effect signals to create high-resolution quadrature output 
signals, providing zero speed and direction sensing. When used 
with special magnetized targets, digital index signals are output 
by the chip and synchronized with the high-resolution circuit 
signal. 
Standard and special encoder kit designs are available with the 
MPS160.

MATERIALS
MATERIALS
Material selection is a critical consideration in ball bearing 
design. The interaction of the balls, races, retainer and lubricant 
with each other and the environment is usually the limiting factor 
in the overall performance of the bearing. Timken’s extensive 
experience in the development and manufacture of ball bearings 
and bearing assemblies is a valuable resource for proper material 
selection. 
Every component and raw material purchased by Timken is 
controlled by a material speciﬁ cation which meets or exceeds 
industry, government and customer specifications. Each 
lot of material is certiﬁ ed and checked against the material 
speciﬁ cation prior to being released to production. Bearing 
material requirements include hardness, grain size, chemical 
analysis and carbide and inclusion ratings. Bearing rings 
and rolling elements are checked in-process for hardness, 
dimensional stability and, if applicable, corrosion resistance. 
Timken maintains an advanced heat-treat department utilizing 
vacuum furnaces and other special equipment. Vacuum 
hardening allows Timken to meet the strictest military and 
commercial requirements for product uniformity. Timken is 
NADCAP approved for heat-treat processes, as well as nondestructive testing and chemical processing. 
RING AND BALL MATERIALS
Available ring and ball materials are summarized in table 1 on 
page 16.
440C STAINLESS STEEL 
440C stainless steel is a martensitic high-carbon steel with 
up to 18 percent chromium, providing both the high hardness 
needed for bearing applications and atmospheric corrosion 
resistance. With standard heat treatment, bearings of 440C 
have a minimum hardness of HRC 58 and can be operated at 
temperatures of 250˚ F (121˚ C). Rings and balls are capable of 
meeting the dimensional stability requirements of MIL-B-81793, 
which specifies maximum dimensional size change over 
the temperature range of -80˚ F to +302˚ F (-62˚ C to +150˚ C). 
With special heat treatment, operating temperatures of 500˚ F
(260˚ C) may be tolerated.
Timken uses the 440C steel made either by air melting, by 
the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process, or by consumable 
electrode vacuum-arc remelting (CEVM). All 440C is  made to the 
strictest limits of cleanliness and uniformity. These requirements, 
especially of micro-cleanliness and carbide structure, have 
resulted in improved raceway ﬁ nishes.
52100 CHROMIUM STEEL 
52100 high-carbon steel is a 1 ½ percent chromium steel and is 
used for a variety of bearing applications such as gyroscope 
spin-axis bearings where higher hardness and better surface 
ﬁ nish are required. 52100 steel has a slightly higher minimum 
hardness than 440C at HRC 60 and greater wear resistance. It is 
sometimes chosen for instrument bearing applications because 
of its extraordinarily uniform microstructure. The standard 
heat treatment will be suitable for service at temperatures as 
high as 250˚ F (121˚ C).  Rings and balls are capable of meeting 
the dimensional stability requirements of MIL-B-81793, which 
speciﬁ es maximum dimensional size change over the temperature 
range of -80˚ F to +302˚ F (-62˚ C to +150˚ C). Special heat treatments 
can be provided for higher operating temperatures.  
The SAE-52100 Timken uses is made by either air melting 
followed by vacuum degassing or by double vacuum melting 
(VIM-VAR). Both of these processes provide material of high 
micro-cleanliness.
RING MARKING FOR MATERIAL 
IDENTIFICATION
For bearings with outside dimensions less than 1.18 in., certain

MATERIALS
NON-STANDARD MATERIALS 
AMS 5749 
AMS 5749(1) high-performance bearing steel is a martensitic 
high-speed stainless steel that combines the hot hardness 
characteristic of M50 with the corrosion and oxidation resistance 
of 440C. This material is suited to hot air valve bearings, but solves 
many other application problems as well.
AMS 5749 has excellent wear resistance, can operate at 
temperatures as high as 600˚ F (316˚ C) and has corrosion 
resistance superior to M50. The AMS 5749 material used at Timken 
is made by vacuum-induction melting followed by vacuum-arc 
remelting (VIM/VAR). This process achieves the highest degree 
of cleanliness and uniformity of structure for this material.
M50 
M50 high-speed steel is a high-performance tool steel containing 
molybdenum, chromium and vanadium. This material is suited to 
main shaft bearings in gas turbine engines, however, it solves 
many other application problems as well. M50 has greater 
wear resistance than both 440C and 52100 and can operate at 
temperatures as high as 600˚ F (316˚ C). All M50 used at Timken 
is made by vacuum-induction melting followed by vacuum-arc 
remelting (VIM/VAR). This process achieves the highest degree 
of cleanliness and uniformity of structure for this material.
M62 
M62 super-high-performance tool steel is a high-alloyed steel 
with very high hardness, excellent wear resistance and superior 
hot hardness. M62 is used in severe service applications 
with temperatures up to 1000˚ F (538˚ C). In addition, M62 has 
demonstrated 10 times the fatigue life compared to standard 
bearing steels. 
Beryllium copper 
Beryllium copper is a precipitation hardening alloy of 2 percent 
beryllium in copper used in applications where non-magnetic 
and electrical conductivity properties are required. It has far less 
hardness (HRC 38 minimum), wear resistance and strength than 
conventional bearing materials, resulting in lower load ratings.
Hybrid bearings 
Hybrid bearings may perform signiﬁ cantly better than an all-steel 
bearing in applications where marginal lubrication, high speed 
and high heat are factors. Silicon nitride and titanium carbide 
hybrid bearings are currently used in many applications including 
gimbal, gyro spin, aircraft accessory and dental handpieces. 
When the internal ball and raceway surfaces of a ball bearing are 
not separated by a sufﬁ cient oil ﬁ lm thickness, the surface ﬁ nish 
high points (known as asperities) can contact each other. When 
the balls and races are made of the same material, the asperities 
can weld together under the very high localized contact stresses 
that occur, resulting in surface damage, particle generation, and 
ultimately shortened bearing service life. For unlubricated or 
marginally lubricated applications, ceramic balls eliminate ballto-race asperity welding, and the resulting negative effects on 
bearing service life. Titanium carbide coated stainless-steel balls 
offer the same beneﬁ ts, but are suggested for use in marginally 
lubricated applications only. Contact your Timken engineer to 
determine the suggested solution for your application.  
In high-speed applications the lower density of silicon nitride 
signiﬁ cantly reduces the centrifugal forces of the balls on the 
outer race.  Bearings with silicon nitride balls also operate cooler 
and exhibit less vibration.   
Most Timken bearings may be ordered with silicon nitride or 
titanium carbide coated balls in combination with 440C and 52100 
steel rings.
Nickel-cobalt alloys 
Nickel-cobalt alloys are used in bearings developed by Timken for 
applications requiring non-magnetic and noncorrosive materials 
with greater load capacity than beryllium copper bearings. While 
not commonly used, these materials can be used in applications 
such as medical components, seawater, chemical and food 
processing environments. Because these materials cannot be 
hardened past HRC 40, they yield bearings with relatively low 
static capacities, and so their application needs to be considered 
very carefully.
Full ceramic bearings 
Full ceramic bearings can be developed for applications requiring 
high hardness, light weight, high temperature and corrosion 
resistance. Limited sizes are available. Consult your engineer 
for availability.

The correct choice of retainer for a precision ball bearing is often 
critical to ensuring bearing performance sufﬁ cient for application 
requirements. 

Aside from its obvious function as a ball separator, the retainer 
makes a vital contribution to overall bearing performance and 
helps determine a bearing’s:  

 • Maximum rotational speed (dN). 

 • Torque characteristics.  

 • Temperature limits.
 • Lubricant system.

SHIELDS AND SEALS
Clearance
Integral shield
Fig. 14. Standard shield 
and seal conﬁ gurations.
SHIELDS AND SEALS
Some applications may not allow the use of open bearings. Shields or seals may be used to protect 
against contamination and help retain lubricant.
SEALS
In debris-heavy applications, seals provide extra contamination 
protection at the sacriﬁ ce of the lowest possible frictional torque 
levels.
Timken miniature and instrument series bearings use a thin ﬂ uoropolymer impregnated glass cloth washer held in the outer ring by 
snap wires. The seal contacts a smooth shoulder on the inner ring.
The standard seal design for Timken thin-section series bearings 
is similar to the shield except that the bore of the rubber molding 
is controlled to maintain positive contact with the inner ring.
In addition to the standard shields and seals, special designs have 
been developed by Timken for demanding applications where a 
standard conﬁ guration would not sufﬁ ce. Consult your Timken 
engineer for more information on special closure designs.
SEAL ADVANTAGES
 • Contact with inner ring prevents small and large particulate 
from entering bearing. 
 • Greatly improves lubricant retention in bearing.
 • Acts as a pressure or ﬂ ow barrier.
SEAL DISADVANTAGES
 • Increases bearing torque.
 • Limits bearing speed due to inner ring contact.

SHIELDS
Timken miniature and instrument series bearings use precision 
300 series stainless-steel shields held in the outer ring by snap 
wires. These shields are accurately positioned in the outer ring 
to maintain a close clearance with the outer diameter of the 
inner ring.
Timken thin-section series bearings use a shield that incorporates 
a stainless-steel insert which has Nitrile rubber bonded to it. The 
shield is held securely in place by compression of the rubber 
around the outside diameter of the insert. The shield bore is held 
concentric to the outside diameter of the inner ring with tight 
tolerances to maintain close running clearance. Shields made 
from Nitrile rubber can be used to 275° F (135° C). For higher 
temperature applications special ﬂ uorocarbon or stainless-steel 
shields can be used.
Fractured race thin-section bearings cannot use standard shields 
due to the thin cross sectional area between the shield recess 
and holding wire shoulder grooves. This bearing type is available 
with integral shields machined as part of the inner ring. 
SHIELD ADVANTAGES
 • Non-contacting with inner ring will not affect torque.
 • Prevents large particles (over 0.005 in.) from entering 
bearing.
 • Improves lubrication retention in bearing.
SHIELD DISADVANTAGES
 • Does not provide positive sealing against ﬁ ne 
contamination (under 0.005 in.).

20  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
TOLERANCES
Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings are 
manufactured in accordance with tolerance classes speciﬁ ed 
by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the 
American Bearing Manufacturer’s Association (ABMA). ANSI/
ABMA Standard 12 covers miniature and instrument bearings 
and Standard 26 covers thin-section bearings.
Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings are 
manufactured in precision classes from ABEC 3 (lowest) to ABEC 
9 (highest) with the most common being ABEC 5 or 7. Please note 
the ANSI/ABMA does not deﬁ ne an ABEC 9 class for thin-section 
bearings. For applications that require a special tolerance not 
covered by any of these precision classes, please contact your 
Timken engineer.
The tables that follow compare the tolerance features of the 
various ABEC classes for miniature, instrument and thin-section 
bearings. These tolerances relate to external dimensions 
as well as the geometric relationship of the ball groove with 
bearing mounting surfaces. These individual tolerance values 
provide a guide to the bearing user in designing his shaft and 
housings, since surfaces to which bearings are mounted should 
have tolerance levels equivalent to those on the corresponding 
bearing surface.
Please note that the 610 and 812 bearings have tolerances 
controlled by the miniature and instrument bearing speciﬁ cation 
(Standard 12), even though they are dimensionally classiﬁ ed as 
thin-section parts.

Both the internal clearance and raceway geometry of a bearing 
have a signiﬁ cant impact on performance.  
CONTACT ANGLE
The contact angle of a bearing is the angle between a line through 
the ball center perpendicular to the bearing axis and a line through 
the two points where the ball contacts the races when the bearing 
axial play is removed.
Fig. 15. Contact angle.
The contact angle of a bearing establishes the bearing’s relative 
axial and radial capability.  
Generally, increasing the contact angle increases axial load 
capacity, axial stiffness and moment stiffness, but at the expense 
of radial load capacity and radial stiffness. Decreasing the 
contact angle has the opposite effect.  There is a geometric limit 
to increasing contact angle. Too great a contact angle increase 
results in the ball/raceway contact path reaching the edge of the 
raceway, which is called truncation.  
The contact angle is commonly referred to in two conditions – free 
contact angle and loaded contact angle.
Free contact angle is the contact angle of a bearing with its axial 
play removed but without any axial loads applied. 
Free contact angle is geometrically related to the bearing 
raceway curvature and radial play. 
With all other parameters ﬁ xed, increasing radial play increases 
free contact angle.  
Loaded contact angle is the contact angle of a bearing under an 
applied axial load. The loaded contact angle is the free contact 
angle plus the increase due to the applied axial load.
RACEWAY CURVATURE
Raceway curvature is deﬁ ned as the ratio of raceway radius 
to ball diameter. Raceway curvature impacts many aspects of 
bearing performance including:
 • Load capacity.
 • Internal friction.
 • Radial play to axial play relationship.
 • Radial play to contact angle relationship.
Timken has selected the raceway curvatures for its standard 
product to provide the appropriate performance balance for the 
typical miniature and instrument bearing applications.  
RADIAL PLAY
Radial play, also known as radial internal clearance or diametral 
clearance, is the total range of movement in the radial direction 
that one ring can have relative to the other.  

Fig. 16. Radial play.
Proper selection of radial play is essential for performance of a 
bearing. Radial play impacts the following aspects of a bearing:
 • Contact angle.
 • Axial play. 
 • Axial and radial capacity.
It is important to realize that the radial play of the bearing can be 
reduced by a number of application conditions including:
 • Interference ﬁ ts at installation.
 • Interference ﬁ t changes due to temperature changes.
 • Temperature gradients across the bearing.
 • Centrifugal forces during operation.

Contact Angle


Proper consideration of the radial play change due to these 
operating conditions is critical. Care must be taken to ensure that 
there is sufﬁ cient internal clearance in the bearing to prevent 
complete loss of radial play from the application conditions. 
Complete loss of radial play results in signiﬁ cant increases in 
friction and heat. It can result in premature bearing damage. 
Timken is able to build product to either contact angle or radial 
play but our standard product is built to the parameter deﬁ ned 
in the table below unless otherwise requested.

AXIAL PLAY
Axial play, also known as endplay, is the total range of pure axial 
movement that that one ring can have relative to the other.
Fig. 17. Axial play.
Axial play is a function of the radial play of the bearing and its 
ball and raceway geometry. It is not typically used to specify a 
bearing’s internal clearance since radial play or contact angle 
are the primary parameters used to specify bearing internal 
clearance.   
Control of axial play in an application can be achieved through 
changes in internal geometry of a single bearing or more 
commonly by incorporating an additional bearing. The bearing 
pair can either be conﬁ gured to have reduced shared axial play or 
it can be preloaded with no axial play. This is commonly achieved 
by accurately controlling the axial separation between the outer 
and inner ring pairs through spacers or shimming.

LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
28  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE 
AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
Lubrication selection and application has a signiﬁ cant impact 
on the performance and operational life of a ball bearing. The 
lubrication of a bearing does the following:
 • Reduce friction and wear of contacting surfaces. 
 • Protect surfaces from oxidation/corrosion. 
Other aspects of bearing performance impacted by lubrication are:
 • Operating temperature management.
 • Contamination management.
REDUCE FRICTION AND WEAR
A lubricant may be seen as a separating layer between two 
sliding surfaces. Its purpose is to inhibit surface wear while 
maintaining the lowest possible friction torque level. The ball and 
raceway surfaces, although precision honed and lapped, appear 
microscopically as a pattern of peaks and valleys. When rubbed 
together under the high unit loading inherent in point contact, 
these asperities are thought to weld together, then break off, 
initiating an adhesive wear process which ultimately damages 
the bearing. Adhesive wear is inhibited by:
 • Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁ lm. 
 • Boundary lubrication. 
 • Mixed-ﬁ lm lubrication. 
EHD FILMS
EHD ﬁ lms are generated dynamically in a rotating bearing and 
are a function of the bearing’s speed, operating load and the 
lubricant’s viscosity in the contact area. Lubricant viscosity 
typically increases when subject to pressure but decreases at 
elevated temperatures so the lubricant viscosity in the contact 
area is a function of the lubricant properties, bearing speed, 
operating load and operating temperatures. Rolling element-torace contacts can be effectively separated by the high lubricant 
viscosities generated under the typical surface contact pressures 
which are in the hundreds of thousands of pounds per square 
inch. Once separated by a distance greater than the combined 
asperity height, the surfaces will not contact and adhesive wear 
will be eliminated.
BOUNDARY LUBRICATING FILMS 
Boundary lubricating films are formed on machined-steel 
surfaces as chemically absorbed compounds resulting from the 
surface’s interaction with its environment. Preferred ﬁ lms may be 
formed by chemical treatment of the surface as it is processed 
and by additives in the lubricating ﬂ uid.
MIXED-FILM LUBRICATION 
This combination of EHD ﬁ lm and boundary conditions describes 
the regime in which many miniature, instrument and thin-section 
ball bearing contacting surfaces operate.
OPERATING TEMPERATURE 
MANAGEMENT
Lubrication can have a significant impact on the operating 
temperature of a bearing. This impact can either be positive or 
negative. Lubrication can positively impact bearing operating 
temperature when the lubrication method and quantity is 
properly conﬁ gured to both reduce heat generation and support 
heat removal from the bearing. Conversely, excessive lubricant 
quantity or too high a lubricant viscosity can result in excessive 
heat generation due to shearing of the lubricant.  
CONTAMINATION MANAGEMENT
Lubrication also can be used to manage bearing contamination. 
Greases provide some protection of internal geometry from 
external contamination. Circulated and ﬁ ltered lubrication is able 
to ﬂ ush wear particles from the rolling contact area.
GENERAL LUBRICANT TYPES
There are three general types of lubricants used in bearings:
 • Oil.
 • Grease.
 • Solid ﬁ lm.
Available lubrication types are summarized in table 12 on page 30.
OIL LUBRICATION
Oil lubrication is primarily used where low bearing friction torque 
is essential for the application. It is also used when the application 
requires the thermal and/or contamination control possible with 
the use of a proper oil system with oil cooling and/or ﬁ ltration 
capability. 


LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  29
GREASE LUBRICATION
Greases are comprised of a base oil blended with a thickener 
in order to provide a reservoir, to maintain position within 
the bearing, and to provide some protection against external 
contamination. This typically results in it providing extended 
service life over oil lubrication.  
The actual contact surface lubrication performance of a grease- 
lubricated bearing is provided primarily by the base oil used in 
the grease.  
The capability of the grease to maintain its position in the bearing 
and the amount of impact it has on bearing torque are primarily 
a function of the thickener used in the grease.  
SOLID-FILM LUBRICATION
Solid-ﬁ lm lubricants are an alternative to conventional oil or 
grease lubrication. They are primarily used when the operating 
environmental conditions are beyond the allowable limits of 
oil and grease lubrication. Solid-film lubricants have been 
developed for speciﬁ c operating conditions.  Understanding the 
capabilities and limitations of a solid-ﬁ lm lubricant is important 
when selecting one for your application. Please consult your 
Timken engineer for assistance with solid-ﬁ lm lubricant selection. 
LUBRICANT SELECTION
Proper selection of a lubricant involves careful consideration 
of the following:
 • Operating temperature range.
 • Viscosity throughout operating temperature range.
 • Operating speeds including type (continuous or oscillatory).
 • Friction torque requirements.
 • Lubricant migration control.
 • Operating loads.
 • Material compatibility.
 • Corrosion protection.
 • Volatility/out gassing tolerance.
 • Storage life.
Military speciﬁ cations describe various classes of lubricants, 
both oils and greases, and usually relate to bulk properties rather 
than to speciﬁ c formulation. As a result, there are a variety of 
lubricants that meet the various lubricant MIL speciﬁ cations. 
When selecting a lubricant, the actual lubricant formulation and 
properties should be considered in addition to the MIL standard 
compliance.
TIMKEN LUBRICATION METHODS
Proper performance of a bearing will depend on both the lubricant 
type and the method of lubricant application. The amount and 
location of lubricant in the bearing, as well as the cleanliness of 
the lubricant depend on the correct method of application. Timken 
can apply a variety of application methods to meet a wide range 
of application requirements. Timken factory-lubricated bearings 
are provided with specially ﬁ ltered lubricants, allowing them to 
be installed directly upon removal from the package. We strongly 
suggest that no further processing be performed on the bearings 
that could affect the cleanliness of the lubricant. Timken offers a 
number of different lubrication techniques to assure the optimal 
lubricant amount and placement.
OILING METHODS
Dip and Drain: Slight excess of oil on all bearing surfaces, 
providing corrosion protection as well as ﬁ nal lubrication. Specify 
as LO or LY.
Dip and Centrifuge: Oil on all surfaces with quantity controlled 
by speciﬁ ed centrifuge level. Specify as LOC or LYC. Special G 
levels along with the time duration of the applied G load can be 
accommodated.
Vacuum Impregnate: Bearings with porous ball retainers are 
immersed in oil under vacuum followed by soak at room pressure, 
thereby forcing oil into pores. Specify as LOV or LYV .
Metered Application:  Speciﬁ c quantities of oil can be applied to 
our bearings by applying a speciﬁ c amount to speciﬁ c locations 
from a  deﬁ ned needle size. Specify LOD or LYD and number of 
drops and needle size (#26 needle is default size).
Film Oiling: Dip bearing into oil-solvent mixture, leaving a thin 
ﬁ lm on all surfaces. Specify as LOF or LYF. Special oil-to-solvent 
ratios or special solvents can be accommodated.

GREASING METHODS
Standard Greasing: A controlled quantity of grease evenly 
distributed into bearing cavity. The standard ﬁ ll quantity is one 
third full. Special quantities are available upon request.
Film Greasing: Apply grease-solvent mixture exclusively to 
bearing cavity to achieve controlled quantity. Specify as LGF or 
LYF, plus quantity in percent ﬁ ll or in milligrams.
Grease Plating: Apply grease-solvent mixture to entire bearing, 
coating all internal and external surfaces.  Specify as LGP or LYP.
SOLID LUBRICATION METHODS
Typically, solid lubricants are either applied as a coating directly 
on the raceways and/or rolling elements, or incorporated into the 
ball retainer for subsequent transfer to the rolling elements and 
raceways during operation.  


PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  31
The preloading of bearings is typical of applications where 
speed, stiffness or position control is critical. Preloading subjects 
bearing components to compressive forces that bring the balls 
into contact with their respective raceways and take up the initial 
clearances of the bearings. There are several basic reasons for 
preloading a ball-bearing set:
 • To remove radial and axial play for more precise positioning.
 • To control the axial and radial stiffness (compliance) of 
the system.
 • To maintain ball-race contact to prevent skidding 
and reduce noise. 
 • To improve load sharing between bearings.
Timken supplies preloaded bearings that are ﬂ ush-ground or have 
matched stick-out/stick-in as a pair to achieve a speciﬁ ed preload 
range when mounted together. Bearings also can be preloaded by:
 • Using springs.
 • Using differential spacers.
 • Gluing bearings (under load) onto a shaft or into a housing.
PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION
DB (BACK-TO-BACK)
Preferred for:
 • High moment stiffness.
 • High speeds.
 • High shaft to housing temperature differential.
DF (FACE-TO-FACE)
DF, or face-to-face mounting, provides higher compliance to allow 
for slight misalignment in the application. This arrangement is 
typically used where the shaft and housing do not have a large 
temperature differential.  
 • Low moment stiffness requirements – allows for slight 
misalignment.
 • Use where housing and shaft do not have a large 
temperature differential.

SELECTING PRELOAD
Selecting preload is highly dependent on the requirements 
of each application. For example, high-speed operation will 
require a different preload from an application where torque 
is to be minimized, or an application where bearing stiffness is 
to be maximized. Preload values are speciﬁ c to the end use of 
each bearing pair. For this reason, standard preload ranges are 
not applied to the miniature, instrument and thin-section series 
bearings.
Preload should be optimized based on the application 
requirements. Miniature and instrument bearings can be 
preloaded to very low levels with preload tolerances as low as 
one pound. Thin-section bearings are inherently very stiff and 
require a wider preload tolerance range than miniature and 
instrument bearings. Timken engineers can assist with selecting 
proper preload speciﬁ cations for each application.


PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  33
DEFLECTION (COMPLIANCE)
Under applied loads, the balls and raceways will deﬂ ect elastically 
up to the yield point of the material. This limit is approximated by 
the static radial (Rs) and static thrust (Ts) load-capacity rating 
for each bearing.  
Due to differences in internal geometry, miniature, instrument 
and thin-section bearings have different deflection rates. 
Timken engineers are available to provide technical assistance 
in evaluating bearing deflection under specific application 
conditions.

PRELOAD MEASUREMENT
Timken has advanced capabilities to measure preload in bearing 
sets. This allows us to provide miniature and thin-section bearings 
with accurate and repeatable preload levels. 


LOAD RATINGS
34  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
LOAD RATINGS 
Load ratings are provided as a guide for bearing selection when considering the application 
requirements. Differences in the methods of load rating calculation exist within the industry and 
care should be taken when comparing different manufacturers’ catalog load rating values.  Load 
ratings in this catalog are calculated for bearing steels using the mean of the standard radial play 
range or in the case of angular-contact bearings, the nominal contact angle tabulated.
This load rating is used in conjunction with the actual applied 
radial load (R) to calculate bearing fatigue life as follows: 

L10  =  16667  [
 C ]

        N          R
Where:   
L10   =  Rating life in hours

N  =  Speed of inner ring rotation, in RPM

C  =  Dynamic load rating

R  =  Applied pure radial load, in lbs.
The rating life as deﬁ ned above relates solely to metal fatigue 
and assumes nominal bearing configuration, alignment, 
lubrication and cleanliness. In addition, these load ratings and 
life calculations are based on the application of a pure radial 
load. Note that the dynamic load rating value is used only in life 
calculations and, for instrument bearing applications, should not 
be approached in actual applied load. Your Timken engineer can 
assist in establishing fatigue life calculations for combination 
thrust and radial loads, pure thrust loads, outer-ring rotation, 
preloaded bearing pairs or probabilities other than 90 percent.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Bearing life may be deﬁ ned as the length of time a bearing will 
operate satisfactorily in the application at its operating speed 
under an applied load. Life predictions depend on careful 
deﬁ nition of failure criteria and consideration of the full range of 
operating conditions, including load cycles, operating speeds, 
mounting practice, environmental conditions and contamination.
The expected fatigue life under operating loads is often not the 
most important design consideration in the selection of instrument 
ball bearings. The dynamic load-rating ﬁ gures are presented 
primarily to permit a comparison of the load-carrying potential for 
bearings of similar material but differing in size, internal design 
and ball complement.
Life predictions are necessarily non-precise because of the 
interaction of these many parameters. There is an established 
method of calculating fatigue life, outlined in ISO/ABMA 
Standards. The ISO/ABMA rating Life (L10) is the number of 
revolutions, or hours at constant speed, that 90 percent of a 
group of nominally identical bearings will attain, or exceed, 
before the ﬁ rst evidence of fatigue develops. The dynamic load 
rating (C) is the constant radial load, stationary with respect to 
the outer ring, that a bearing can endure for a rating life of one 
million revolutions of the inner ring, or 500 hours at 33 1/3 RPM. 
The dynamic load rating is determined by bearing geometry, 
number and size of balls, bearing pitch diameter, and ring and ball 
material. The dynamic load rating (C) for each bearing is shown 
in the tabulations in the body of the catalog.


LOAD RATINGS
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  35
STATIC LOAD RATINGS 
As increasing load is applied to a non-rotating bearing, a value 
will be reached at which permanent deformation of raceways 
and balls occurs. The resulting indentations or brinells become 
defects interfering with smooth operation and shortening 
bearing life. Static load ratings relate to limiting loads applied 
to non-rotating bearings, as in bearing mounting, or to shock 
loads applied to rotating bearings. Operating loads should not 
approach the rated value.
ISO/ABMA standards state that static load ratings depend on 
the maximum contact stress between the balls and either of the 
two raceways. It is affected by material, number and size of balls, 
raceway curvatures, raceway depths and contact angle.
A maximum contact stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) has been 
established as a satisfactory limit for most instrument-bearing 
applications and is the basis for static load ratings tabulated 
herein.
Where low vibration and frictional torque levels are of primary 
concern, applied loads should result in no more than 508,000 PSI 
(3.5 GPa) maximum contact stress, representing an approximate 
40 percent reduction from the tabulated static load ratings.
STATIC RADIAL LOAD RATINGS
The static radial load rating (Rs) is that pure radial load which, 
when applied to a non-rotating ball bearing, will result in a 
maximum stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) at the most heavily 
loaded ball contact.
STATIC THRUST LOAD RATINGS
The static thrust load rating (Ts) is that pure axial load which, 
when applied to a ball bearing, will result in: 
 • a maximum stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) and or
 • the limit at which the ball-raceway contact area is contained completely within the raceway (i.e., the contact area 
is not truncated by the raceway shoulder or either ring).


SHAFT AND HOUSING FITS  
36  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG   
SHAFT AND HOUSING FITS
Since Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section ball 
bearings are precision mechanical components, it is important 
that the size and tolerances of the shaft O.D., housing bore, and 
adjacent shoulders be carefully chosen and be consistent with 
the tolerances of the bearings.
The inner and outer rings of these bearings are relatively thin in 
cross section. These bearing rings will be distorted when ﬁ tted 
with interference on shafts or in housings which are not of true 
geometric form. Shaft and housing geometric dimensioning and 
tolerancing should meet or exceed that of the bearings. See pages 
38 and 39 for values based on journal size.
When designing mating components to be used with miniature 
and thin-section ball bearings, users must be aware of the 
effects of mating component design upon the bearing geometry. 
Clearance holes or tapped holes in close proximity to the shaft 
seat or housing bore can cause distortions in the ﬁ nal ﬁ tted 
bearing. Many customers need to install bearings easily, which 
will necessitate loose ﬁ ts on both the shaft and in the housing. 
Some customers also utilize adhesives during fitting of the 
bearing, in which case the shaft and housing sizes will be dictated 
by the clearance required by the adhesive. During ﬁ nal assembly 
of a bearing with adhesive, much care must be taken to keep 
adhesive, primer, sealer, curing agents, etc., out of the bearing, 
or early bearing damage will result.
Shaft and housing diameters should be held to tolerances equal 
to the bore and O.D. tolerances of the bearing to be used. Use of 
larger tolerances negates the advantages of precision positional 
control built into the bearing itself. 
A signiﬁ cant percent of the interference ﬁ t reduces the internal 
clearance of the bearing. Interference fits are even more 
signiﬁ cant in their effect on increasing preload in factory duplex 
preloaded pairs. 
If variation in tolerance results in unacceptable range of 
interference or clearance ﬁ ts between the bearing and the shaft 
and/or housing, selective assembly of coded bearings matched 
with similarly graded shaft and housing diameters may be utilized. 
This approach can be more economical than machining shafts 
and housings to tighter tolerances. See page 37 for coding of 
bores and O.D. style.
This information assumes that the shaft and housing are 
manufactured from materials with a similar coefﬁ cient of thermal 
expansion as bearing steel (5.6 E-6 to 6.6 E-6 in./in./° F). See ﬁ g. 
24 for coefﬁ cients of expansion.
SHOULDER HEIGHTS
Shaft and housing shoulders are critical to the performance of 
the bearing.
Housing and shaft ﬁ llet radii for the shoulders should not exceed 
the radius (r) dimension listed in the product data tables (starting 
on page 50). The product tables also provide shaft and housing 
shoulder diameters for Timken standard bearings.
Sleeves, spacers, snap rings and similar devices can be used to 
provide shoulders, if the appropriate tolerances are maintained.

CODING 
When more precise ﬁ ts than can be achieved with standard 
tolerances are desired, the bore and/or O.D. dimensions can be 
coded to the nearest 0.000100 in. or, if necessary, to the nearest 
0.000050 in. Bearings so coded are packaged in groups and 
labeled with their specific code. Coded bearings can be 
selectively assembled with components that are similarly coded 
so the actual ﬁ ts are closer to the average ﬁ t speciﬁ ed. Bearing 
codes for the various tolerances are listed in table 13.
For miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings, the codes are 
determined on the basis of the minimum bore and the maximum 
O.D. size.
The basic symbol ZDM is used to deﬁ ne or specify a condition 
where both bores and both O.D.s of a preloaded pair are selected 
to be the same size within the increment indicated. It is not 
necessary that the bore and O.D. be of the same code symbol. 
The code symbol of the pair will be that of the smaller bore and 
the larger O.D. of the pair (maximum material condition).
Also available on metric bearings is coding to 1 micrometer 
increments rounded off to 0.000040 in. Use preﬁ x M, as in MZD, 
etc., to specify.
To avoid confusion between digits or letters and symbols, hyphens 
are used before bore and/or O.D. symbols. The bore code is the 
ﬁ rst digit.

BEARING TESTING
BEARING TORQUE TESTING
Ball bearing frictional torque measurements are dependent upon 
bearing speed, load, alignment, internal geometries and surface 
ﬁ nishes. Since bearing applications involve inﬁ nite variations of 
these parameters, Timken has standardized production tests for 
measurement of both starting torque and running torque. These 
tests compare bearing performance levels under standardized 
test conditions but do not necessarily simulate actual application 
levels. These tests meet or exceed guidelines established in MILSTD-206, the most comprehensive torque speciﬁ cation in the 
industry. Torque testing conditions other than the ones deﬁ ned 
in MIL-STD-206 are available upon request.
STARTING TORQUE MEASUREMENT
Starting torque, deﬁ ned as the torque necessary to start bearing 
rotation under an applied thrust load, is measured under a 75 gm 
thrust load on bearings with an O.D. of 3/8 in. or less, 400 gm on 
larger bearing sizes, and is expressed in milligram-millimeters. 
Torque testing is performed for customers requiring veriﬁ cation 
that a bearing is capable of meeting a certain torque limit. Often, 
customers will deﬁ ne a maximum starting torque which is limited 
by the available power to start rotation in an application.

GENERAL CONDITIONS
The maximum starting values in the table 15 are subject to speciﬁ c 
deﬁ nitions and test conditions covered in ABMA Standard 12 for 
instrument ball bearings. These standard torque values are valid 
for bearings that are:
 • ABEC 7P tolerances.
 • Open or shielded bearings.
 • Stainless 440C or SAE 52100 material.
 • Crown or ribbon retainers.
 • Lubrication with MIL-PRF-6085 oil.
Timken interprets the test conditions such that prior to testing, the 
bearings are to be cleaned with a ﬁ ltered solvent, lubricated with 
one drop of ﬁ ltered MIL-PRF-6085 oil (or an equivalent viscosity 
lube) and demagnetized. Testing is to be done in a clean room 
environment.
The bearings are to be tested a minimum of 10 starts (5 per side) 
with the test load applied axially in a vertical position.

RUNNING-TORQUE MEASUREMENT
Running torque is the resistance to rotation under specific 
operating parameters. Timken can perform running-torque 
measurements on most miniature, instrument and thin-section 
ball bearing types and sizes. When testing miniature bearings to 
MIL-STD-206, a low rotational speed of 2 RPM is used and loads 
of 75 gm or 400 gm are applied axially to the bearing. Thin-section 
bearings are tested under user speciﬁ ed loads and speeds. This 
type of testing is usually reserved for customers who require an 
estimate of the average torque it takes to operate the bearing. 
Typically, customers will deﬁ ne a maximum running torque so they 
are sure that the driving components in their system will have the 
ability to operate correctly on a continuous basis.

performance of bearings by visually identifying problems in 
existing bearing equipment or identifying problems prior to use.
Torque testing can be used to diagnose a variety of issues with 
bearings, including, for example, poor geometry, particulate 
contaminants, retainer hang-up, bruises or damage to the 
raceway.
Running-torque traces provide the following data:
 • ART - average running torque.
 • PRT - peak running torque.
 • AHW - average hash width.
 • MHW - max. hash width.


INSPECTION
42  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
INSPECTION 
Quality is a core value of The Timken Company.  The quality control 
system utilized by Timken complies with ISO 9001 and AS9100. 
Both in-process and ﬁ nal inspection are performed as standard 
practice on a sample from each lot. These controls ensure the 
highest level of product quality is supplied. 
Higher levels of inspection may be applied to spaceﬂ ight or 
other critical use bearing applications. A 100 percent inspection 
of critical dimensional and visual features can be performed. In 
addition, actual measured values for designated features may be 
documented for each assembly by serial number.  The following 
are examples of features that may be inspected and documented 
on each assembly:
 • Bore.
 • Outside diameter.
 • Width.
 • Contact angle/radial play.
 • Preload.
 • Lubrication weight.
 • Torque.
Material traceability information can be supplied with each lot. 
Certiﬁ cation of ring material, ball material, separator material and 
lubrication may be supplied as part of the end item data package. 
If required, this information can be traceable to a speciﬁ c bearing 
serial number.

PACKAGING/LABELING
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  43
PACKAGING/LABELING
The packaging of Timken bearings is designed to ensure that 
clean and undamaged product is delivered to the customer. 
The containers provide easy identiﬁ cation, complete protection 
in transit and storage, and best meet the use and handling 
requirements of the customer. To prevent contamination, 
packaging operations are performed in a Timken clean room. The 
same rigid cleanliness standards are observed in the packaging 
section as are speciﬁ ed for the inspection, lubricating and testing 
sections of the clean room.
A wide range of packaging materials and methods are available to 
accommodate a variety of customer needs. Examples of standard 
packages available:
• Intimate packaging:
• Pill pack.
• Vial pack.
• Nylon bag.
• Polyethylene bag.
• Secondary packaging:
• Box.
• Aclar® pouch.
• Aluminum foil pouch.
The necessary type or method of packaging should always 
be speciﬁ ed on drawings or purchase orders. If no speciﬁ c 
packaging is requested, bearings will be packed in pill pack 
strips or individual clean bags. Timken engineers can assist in 
developing speciﬁ c packaging instructions for each application.
To reduce the possibility of bearing contamination at the user’s 
facility, all outer packaging, such as boxes, cartons, or secondary 
pouches, should be removed and the intimate wrap cleaned 
before being taken into clean areas.
INTIMATE PACKAGING 
PILL PACK
Pill packs are formed from strips of transparent, heat-sealable, 
polymer ﬁ lm. This material is impervious to most lubricants, offers 
low vapor permeability and low gas penetration. The  static-free 
and clean ﬁ lm is heat-sealed into a strip of ﬁ ve pouches with one 
bearing in each pouch. Each pouch is labeled. To prevent damage 
during shipment, multiple pill pack strips are placed in a unit box 
and then enclosed in a sturdy, corrugated shipping carton.  Filler 
material is used to prevent shifting and to strengthen the package.
VIAL PACK
For high production requirements, packaging in transparent
vials (that may be opened and resealed) is available. Each 
vial contains up to 50 bearings and is capped on each end. A 
label is applied to each vial. Several vials are normally packed 
in a polyethylene bag and each bag is labeled with the same 
information as on the individual vial label. The vials are then 
placed into a shipping container.
Fig. 28. Miniature pill pack.
Fig. 29. Vial pack.
NYLON BAG

provides an excellent air and moisture barrier along with good 
chemical resistance.  These clean bags are certiﬁ ed to NASA JPG 
5322.1 Level 25 cleanliness or better. Bearings are heat-sealed 
into individual bags. If requested, bags can be backﬁ lled with 
dry nitrogen and/or vacuum heat-sealed for added protection. 
POLYETHYLENE BAG
Intimate bags of polyethylene provide a good moisture barrier and 
chemical-resistance. Bags are produced from material meeting 
the requirements of A-A-3174, Type 1 and are in compliance with 
MIL-DTL-117, Type I, Class B, Style 2. Cleanliness is certiﬁ ed to 
NASA JPG 5322.1 Level 50 or better. Bearings are heat-sealed

BEARING HANDLING
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  45
BEARING HANDLING 
Miniature, instrument and thin-section ball bearings are precision 
devices that provide long service life when properly speciﬁ ed and 
applied. However, unskilled or careless handling will inevitably 
result in poor performance and life. Many problems encountered 
by miniature, instrument and thin-section bearing users are 
created through improper handling.
Particulate contamination into miniature, instrument and thinsection ball bearings is probably the most universal problem and 
one of the more difﬁ cult to control.
Miniature, instrument and thin-section ball bearings are used in 
torque and noise-sensitive applications. Even very small particles 
of foreign matter, even a few microinches in size can degrade 
the quiet-running qualities and low-torque values of the bearing.
Particulate contamination must be controlled throughout the 
entire life of the bearing. Timken miniature, instrument and thinsection bearings are manufactured, assembled, inspected, tested 
and packaged under rigidly controlled conditions. It is imperative 
that bearing users extend good handling practices so that the 
full performance potential of Timken bearings may be realized.
Some fundamentals to preserve bearing cleanliness are:
 • Clean work areas.
 • Properly dressed personnel.
 • Cleaned and maintained bearing handling instruments 
and related equipment.
 • Proper handling techniques.
 • The customer should maintain demagnetized bearing 
condition.
Timken bearings should be kept in the original, unopened 
packages until ready for installation. Only the actual required 
number of bearings should be removed from the package at a 
time. Bearings should be removed from the protective package 
only in a clean, dry and dust-free atmosphere. If the bearings are 
removed from their packaging, any unused bearings should be 
stored and properly identiﬁ ed in clean, dry, covered containers.
It is preferable to handle bearings with speciﬁ cally designed, 
handheld instruments, such as precision non-magnetic tweezers. 
In some instances, it may be necessary to handle bearings by 
hand. In this case, clean, dry, talc-free, silicon-free ﬁ nger cots 
or gloves should be worn. Microscopic skin particles shed easily 
from hands and can cause bearing contamination. Furthermore, 
most bearing steels, other than AISI 440C, will corrode rapidly 
from moisture and other residue left after skin contact.
A controlled work environment for handling bearings will help to 
reduce contamination and corrosion problems. Ideally, a clean 
room should be used for installation of precision assemblies. If 
not available, an individual hooded work-station or laminar ﬂ ow 
bench may be used. 
Timken bearings are thoroughly inspected, washed and lubricated 
to stringent specifications prior to final packaging. Timken 
bearings are usually ready for immediate installation without the 
need for further cleaning or lubrication.
If any bearings become accidentally contaminated, it is suggested 
they be returned to Timken for cleaning and relubrication.
Note: Timken bearings are thoroughly demagnetized prior to shipment to the 
customer. Since bearings can potentially become partially magnetized during 
shipment, it is suggested that the customer perform a demagnetization process, 
if applicable.

BEARING INSTALLATION
DO
DON'T
Fig 32. Correct and incorrect mounting practices.
BEARING INSTALLATION
 • The mounting components, shafts/housings/related hardware and tooling should be thoroughly cleaned prior to any 
contact with the bearing.
 • The overall performance of a ball bearing is signiﬁ cantly  
affected by the geometry of the mating components. Shaft 
or housing diameters and geometry must be established 
before any attempt is made to install the bearings (see shaft 
and housing tolerances, page 38-39).
 • Interference ﬁ ts with the shaft or housing provides positive 
retention and location. Excessive interference between the 
bearing and mounting surfaces will reduce the designed 
internal clearances.
 • Geometric errors such as out-of-roundness will be transferred to the mating bearing ring. Therefore, a round bearing can be distorted by an out-of-round shaft or housing.
 • Clearance ﬁ ts do not affect bearing geometry, but also do 
not provide for the same degree of positive positioning as 
interference ﬁ ts. Clearance ﬁ ts are prone to fretting corrosion at the mounting interfaces during normal operation. 
Installation tooling must be properly designed and manufactured. 
Important points to consider are:
 • Tooling should be designed to be easily cleaned and remain 
burr free.
 • Tooling should mount the bearings squarely onto the shaft 
or into the housing. Misalignment during installation can 
severely distort a bearing.
 • Tooling must be designed and used in a manner that will not 
damage a bearing. 
 • All installation forces must be transmitted through the  
mounting ring and not through the balls. Transferring the 
force through the balls will result in damage to the balls and 
races, resulting in high torque and noise. See ﬁ g. 32.
 • Shock or impact techniques should never be used to mount 
the bearing. 
 • Differential thermal expansion methods may be used in the 
assembly to reduce the amount of force required to mount 
the bearing. Bearings may be temporarily heated up to 
275° F (+135° C) to aid in assembly onto shafts.

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  93
THIN-SECTION 
BALL BEARINGS 
Thin-section ball bearings, 
with their large complements 
of small-diameter balls, provide 
greater stiffness and lower torque 
while permitting a signiﬁ cant reduction 
in weight and space when compared to 
standard-section bearings. These advantages 
have found wide acceptance in many critical applications 
where thin bearing cross sections are important.
This section of the catalog represents a portion of products 
offered by Timken. Timken also produces many specialized 
bearings, assemblies and bearing-related products for 
particular applications where a standard bearing will not do.
Contact your Timken engineer for assistance in choosing the 
most appropriate standard or custom Timken product for your 
speciﬁ c application.

TIMKEN® TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS - 
RELIABILITY, VERSATILITY, CHOICE
DESIGN FEATURES
Each tapered roller bearing contains four interdependent 
components: the cone (inner ring), the cup (outer ring), tapered 
rollers (rolling elements) and the cage (roller retainer).
Tapered angles allow our bearings to efﬁ ciently control a 
combination of radial and thrust loads. The steeper the outer 
ring angle, the greater ability the bearing has to handle thrust 
loads. To provide a true rolling motion of the rollers on the 
raceways, the extensions of the raceways and the tapered 
surfaces of the rollers come together at a common point, the 
apex, on the axis of rotation.

SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS 
AND COMPONENTS
SHELF LIFE
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/
component design life as follows:
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation.
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity and 
extended storage.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
To help you get the most value from our products, Timken provides 
guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated ball and roller 
bearings, components and assemblies. Shelf life information is 
based on Timken and industry test data and experience.
European REACH compliance
Timken lubricants, greases and similar products sold in 
standalone containers or delivery systems are subject to the 
European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, 
please contact your Timken engineer.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for our 
ﬁ nished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
referred to as “products”):
 • Unless directed otherwise by Timken, products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 • Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on 
the packaging.
 • Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 • After a product is removed from its packaging, it should 
be placed into service as soon as possible.
 • When removing a product that is not individually packaged 
from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the product is removed. 
 • The storage area temperature should be maintained 
between 0° C (32° F) and 40° C (104° F); temperature 
ﬂ uctuations should be minimized. 
 • The relative humidity should be maintained below 
60 percent and the surfaces should be dry. 
 • The storage area should be kept free from airborne 
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, harmful 
vapors, etc. 
 • The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration. 
 • Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Most bearing components typically ship protected with a 
corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant. These 
components may be used in oil-lubricated applications without 
removal of the corrosion-preventive compound. When using 
some specialized grease lubrications, we advise you to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before packing the 
bearing components with suitable grease. 
Be careful in selecting lubrication, however, since different 
lubricants are often incompatible. 
When you receive a bearing shipment, do not remove products 
from their packaging until they are ready for mounting so they 
do not become corroded or contaminated. 
Store bearings and bearing housings in an appropriate 
atmosphere so they remain protected for the intended period.

6  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
SINGLE-ROW BEARINGS
TS - SINGLE-ROW
This is the basic and the most widely used type of tapered 
roller bearing. It consists of the inner-ring assembly and the 
outer ring. It is usually ﬁtted as one of an opposing pair. During 
equipment assembly, single-row bearings can be “set” to the 
required clearance (endplay) or preload condition to optimize 
performance.
TSF - SINGLE-ROW, WITH FLANGED  

OUTER RING
The TSF type is a variation on the basic single-row bearing. TSF 
bearings have a ﬂanged outer ring to facilitate axial location and 
accurately aligned seats in a through-bored housing.
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS TYPES AND CAGES 
TDI
DOUBLE-ROW BEARINGS
TDO - DOUBLE OUTER RING
This has a one-piece (double) outer ring and two single inner 
rings. It is usually supplied complete with an inner-ring spacer 
as a pre-set assembly. This conﬁguration gives a wide effective 
bearing spread and is frequently chosen for applications where 
overturning moments are a signiﬁcant load component. TDO 
bearings can be used in ﬁxed (locating) positions or allowed to 
ﬂoat in the housing bore, for example, to compensate for shaft 
expansion. TDOCD outer rings also are available in most sizes. 
These outer rings have holes in the O.D. that permit the use of 
pins to prevent outer ring rotation in the housing.
TDI   - DOUBLE INNER RING
TDIT - DOUBLE INNER RING WITH  

TAPERED BORE
Both comprise a one-piece (double) inner ring and two single 
outer rings. They are usually supplied complete with an outerring spacer as a pre-set assembly. TDI and TDIT bearings can be 
used at ﬁxed (locating) positions on rotating shaft applications. 
For rotating housing applications, the double inner ring of type 
TDI can be used to ﬂoat on the stationary shaft. Type TDIT has 
a tapered bore to facilitate removal when an interference ﬁt is 
essential, yet regular removal is required.

2S - TWO SINGLE-ROW ASSEMBLY
Often referred to as snap-ring assemblies, type 2S consist of 
two basic single-row bearings (type TS). They are supplied 
complete with inner-ring and outer-ring spacers to give a predetermined bearing setting when assembled. Type 2S have a 
speciﬁed setting range to suit the duty of the application. They 
have an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring, which also serves as 
the outer-ring spacer, to give axial location in a through-bored 
housing.
SR - SET-RIGHTTM ASSEMBLY
Type SR are made to a standard setting range, based on Timken’s 
SET-RIGHT™ automated setting technique suitable for most 
industrial applications. They have two spacers and an optional 
snap-ring that may be used for axial location. Because both types 
are made up of popular sizes of single-row bearings, they provide 
a low-cost option for many applications.
There are two basic mounting arrangements for spacer 
assemblies. 
 • Type 2TS-IM (indirect mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings with an inner-ring  

and outer-ring spacer. In some applications, the outer-ring  

spacer is replaced by a shoulder in the bearing housing.
 • Type 2TS-DM (direct mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings, with inner rings  

abutting and an outer-ring spacer. They are generally  used  

at ﬁxed (locating) positions on rotating shaft applications.

 BACK FACE RIB
These three bearing types are similar to the TDO with a one-piece 
(double) outer ring and two single inner rings. The inner-ring front 
faces are extended so they abut, eliminating the need for a 
separate inner-ring spacer. Supplied with a built-in clearance to 
give a standard setting range, these bearings provide a solution 
for many ﬁxed or ﬂoating bearing applications where optimum 
simplicity of assembly is required.
Types TNASW and TNASWE are variations having chamfers 
and slots on the front face of the inner ring to provide lubrication 
through the shaft. Type TNASWE have extended back face ribs 
on the inner rings which are ground on the O.D. to allow for the 
use of a seal or stamped closure. These designs are typically 
used on stationary shaft applications.

SPACER ASSEMBLIES
Any two single-row bearings (type TS) can be supplied as a 
double-row, pre-set, ready-to-ﬁt assembly by the addition of 
spacers, machined to pre-determined dimensions and tolerances. 
Spacer assemblies are provided in two types: "2S" and "SR". This 
concept can be applied to produce custom-made double-row 
bearings to suit speciﬁc applications. In addition to providing 
a bearing that automatically gives a pre-determined setting at 
assembly without the need for a manual setting, it is possible 
to modify the assembly width to suit an application, simply by 
varying the spacer widths.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CAGES
STAMPED-STEEL CAGES
The most common type of cage used for tapered roller bearings 
is the stamped-steel cage. These cages are mass produced 
from low-carbon sheet steel using a series of cutting, forming 
and punching operations. These cages can be used in high 
temperature and harsh lubricant environments.  
Fig. 8. Stamped-steel cage. 
POLYMER CAGES
Cages for tapered roller bearings made of polymer material are 
used primarily for pre-greased and sealed package designs. The 
most common polymer materials used are Nylon thermoplastics 
with glass reinforcement. Polymer cages can be mass produced 
in large quantities and offer more design ﬂexibility than stampedsteel types. Polymer cages are lightweight and easy to assemble. 
In some instances, increased bearing rating can be achieved 
by allowing one or two extra rollers in the bearing complement. 
Care should be exercised when using aggressive lubricants with 
EP (extreme-pressure) additives in combination with elevated 
temperatures greater than 107° C (225° F).  
CAGES
8  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
MACHINED CAGES
Machined cages for tapered roller bearings are robust in design 
and are suited for high-speed and high-load applications. 
Machined cages use alloy steels and are produced through 
milling and broaching operations. Assembly does not require 
a close-in operation and rollers can be retained using nibs or 
staking. Oil holes also can be easily added for extra lubrication 
for demanding applications. Some designs are silver plated for 
special applications.  
PIN-TYPE CAGES
Tapered roller bearing pin-type cages retain the rolling elements 
by the use of a pin located through an axial hole in the center of 
the roller. Pin-type cages for tapered roller bearings consist of 
two rings with roller pins attached by screw threads at one end 
and welding at the other end. These types of cages are primarily 
used for larger tapered roller bearing designs (greater than 
400 mm [15.7480 in.] O.D.). Pin-type cages are machined out 
of steel and typically allow for an increased number of rolling 
elements. Pin-type cages are restricted to low-speed applications 
(less than 20 m/sec [4000 ft/min] rib speed).


 TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  9
Tapered bearings are manufactured to a number of speciﬁcations with each having classes that 
deﬁne tolerances on dimensions such as bore, O.D., width and runout. Metric bearings have been 
manufactured to corresponding standard negative tolerances.
Boundary dimension tolerances for tapered roller bearing usage are listed in the following tables. 
These tolerances are provided for use in selecting bearings for general applications in conjunction 
with the bearing mounting and ﬁtting practices offered in later sections.
The following table summarizes the different speciﬁcations and classes for tapered roller bearings.

Runout. Runout is a measure 
of rotational accuracy 
expressed by Total Indicator 
Reading (T.I.R.). Total 
displacement is measured 
by an instrument sensing 
against a moving surface, 
or moved with respect to a 
ﬁxed surface. A radial runout 
measurement includes both 
roundness errors and the 
centering error of the surface 
that the instrument head

MOUNTING, FITTING AND SETTING
26  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
MOUNTING 
Tapered roller bearings are designed to take both radial and 
thrust loading. Under radial loads, a force is generated in the 
axial direction that must be counteracted. As a result, tapered 
roller bearings are normally adjusted against a second bearing. 
They can be mounted in either a direct or indirect mounting 
arrangement shown in ﬁg. 9. For applications where a direct 
mounting arrangement is used and the outer ring is used to adjust 
the bearing setting, the outer ring is usually set in position by an 
outer-ring follower or mounted in an outer-ring carrier. See ﬁg. 10. 
For indirect mountings, bearing setting is typically achieved by 
clamping against one of the inner rings. Various designs, including 
locknuts, stakenuts and end plates as shown in ﬁg. 11 can be used. 
For applications requiring precision-class bearings, a special 
precision nut can be used.
Backing shoulder diameters are listed for tapered roller bearings 
in the product data sections in this catalog.

FITTING PRACTICE 
General industrial application fitting practice standards for 
inner rings and outer rings are shown in the tables starting on 
page 32. These tables apply to solid or heavy-sectioned steel 
shafts, heavy-sectioned ferrous housings and normal operating 
conditions. To use the tables, it is necessary to determine if the 
member is rotating or stationary, the magnitude, direction and 
type of loading, and the shaft ﬁnish.

Certain table ﬁts may not be adequate for light shaft and housing 
sections, shafts other than steel, nonferrous housings, critical 
operation conditions such as high speed, unusual thermal or 
loading conditions or a combination thereof. Also, assembly 
procedures and the means and ease of obtaining the bearing 
setting may require special ﬁts. In these cases, experience 
should be used as a guideline or your Timken engineer should 
be consulted for review and suggestions.
Rotating inner rings generally should be applied with an 
interference ﬁt. In special cases, loose ﬁts may be considered 
if it has been determined by test or experience they will perform 
satisfactorily. The term “rotating inner ring” describes a condition 
in which the inner ring rotates relative to the load. This may occur 
with a rotating inner ring under a stationary load or a stationary 
inner ring with a rotating load. Loose ﬁts will permit the inner 
rings to creep and wear the shaft and the backing shoulder. This 
may result in excessive bearing looseness and possible bearing 
and shaft damage.
Stationary inner ring ﬁtting practice depends on the application. 
Under conditions of high speed, heavy loads or shock, interference 
ﬁts using heavy-duty ﬁtting practices should be used. With inner 
rings mounted on unground shafts subjected to moderate loads 
(no shock) and moderate speeds, a metal-to-metal or near zero 
average ﬁt is used. In sheave and wheel applications using 
unground shafts, or in cases using ground shafts with moderate 
loads (no shock), a minimum ﬁt near zero to a maximum looseness 
that varies with the inner ring bore size is suggested. In stationary 
inner ring applications requiring hardened and ground spindles, 
a slightly looser ﬁt may be satisfactory. Special ﬁts also may be 
necessary on installations such as multiple sheave crane blocks. 
Rotating outer ring applications where the outer ring rotates 
relative to the load should always use an interference ﬁt. 
Stationary, non-adjustable and fixed single-row outer ring 
applications should be applied with a tight ﬁt wherever practical. 
Generally, adjustable ﬁts may be used where the bearing setup 
is obtained by sliding the outer ring axially in the housing bore. 
However, in certain heavy-duty, high-load applications, tight ﬁts 
are necessary to prevent pounding and plastic deformation of 
the housing. Tightly ﬁtted outer rings mounted in carriers can 
be used. Tight ﬁts should always be used when the load rotates 
relative to the outer ring.
To permit through-boring when the outside diameters of singlerow bearings mounted at each end of a shaft are equal, and one 
is adjustable and the other ﬁxed, it is suggested that the same 
adjustable ﬁt be used at both ends. However, tight ﬁts should 
be used if outer rings are backed against snap rings to prevent 
excessive dishing of snap rings, groove wear and possible loss 
of ring retention. Only outer rings with a maximum housing 
ﬁllet radius requirement of 1.3 mm (0.05 in.) or less should be 
considered for a snap ring backing.
Double-row stationary double outer rings are generally mounted 
with loose ﬁts to permit assembly and disassembly. The loose 
fit also permits float when a floating bearing is mounted in 
conjunction with an axially ﬁxed bearing on the other end of 
the shaft.
Fitting practice tables 22-32 on pages 32-46, have been prepared 
for both metric and inch dimensions.
For the inch system bearings, classes 4 and 2 (standard) have 
been included.
The metric system bearings that have been included are: classes 
K and N (metric system standard bearings).

Interference ﬁts on thin-walled shafts and light-section steel 
housings have a tendency to collapse the inner ring seat and 
stretch the outer ring seat, resulting in less change in bearing 
setting and overall width. The effects can be calculated according 
to the following formulas.
Inner ring setting reduction/width increase:
Outer ring setting reduction/width increase:
For shaft or housing material other than steel, consult your 
Timken engineer. 
Effects of tight ﬁts on bearing setting/width
Interference ﬁts of the inner ring cause inner ring expansion and 
interference ﬁts of the outer ring cause outer ring contraction. As 
the inner ring diameters increase and the outer ring diameters 
decrease, internal clearance within the bearing is reduced and 
bearing width is increased. The change in clearance or setting 
is approximately equal to the change in width.  
For matched assemblies where the setting is pre-set from the 
factory and SET-RIGHT assemblies, the effects of ﬁt must be taken 
into account to provide the desired mounted setting. 
Double-row and four-row bearings that are provided with spacers 
are examples of matched assemblies. These bearings are pre-set 
to a speciﬁc bench endplay or axial clearance prior to installation 
into the application. Mounting the bearing with a tight ﬁt will 
reduce this bench endplay. In order to meet the desired mounted 
setting, the bench endplay must be compensated for the ﬁt effect.
SET-RIGHT assemblies rely on the control of bearing, shaft and 
housing tolerances to known distributions, resulting in a statistical 
mounted bearing setting range. This mounted setting takes into 
account any reductions in setting due to tight ﬁts.
Bearing width increase can affect setting in applications such as 
outer-ring-adjusted, direct-mounting designs. In this case, a shim 
is inserted between the outer ring and a backing plate. Tight ﬁts 
will affect calculation of the shim thickness. In other applications 
where axial tolerance summation calculations are made, tight ﬁt 
effects must be taken into consideration.

Axial Endplay
SETTING
Setting is deﬁned as the axial clearance between roller and 
raceway. Establishing the setting at the time of assembly is an 
inherent advantage of tapered roller bearings. They can be set 
to provide optimum performance in almost any application. Fig. 
13 gives an example of the relationship between fatigue life 
and bearing setting. Unlike some types of anti-friction bearings, 
tapered roller bearings do not rely strictly on housing or shaft 
ﬁts to obtain a certain bearing setting. One ring can be moved 
axially relative to the other to obtain the desired bearing setting.
At assembly, the conditions of bearing setting are deﬁned as:
 • Endplay (EP) – An axial clearance 
between rollers and raceways 
producing a measurable axial shaft 
movement when a small axial force 
is applied – ﬁrst in one direction 
then in the other, while oscillating 
or rotating the shaft. See ﬁg. 14.
 • Preload (PL) – An axial interference 
between rollers and raceways such 
that there is no measurable axial 
shaft movement when a small  
axial force is applied – in both 
directions – while oscillating or 
rotating the shaft.
 • Line-to-line – A zero setting  
condition: the transitional point 
between endplay and preload.
Bearing setting obtained during initial assembly and adjustment 
is the cold or ambient bearing setting, and is established before 
the equipment is subjected to service.
Bearing setting during operation is known as the operating 
bearing setting, and is a result of changes in the ambient bearing 
setting due to thermal expansion and deﬂections encountered 
during service.
The ambient bearing setting necessary to produce the optimum 
operating bearing setting varies with the application. Application 
experience or testing generally determines optimum settings. 
Frequently, however, the exact relationship of ambient to 
operating bearing setting is unknown and an educated estimate 
has to be made. To determine a suggested ambient bearing setting 
for a speciﬁc application, contact your Timken engineer.
Generally, the ideal operating bearing setting is near zero to 
maximize bearing life (ﬁg. 13). Most bearings are set with endplay 
at assembly to reach the desired near-zero setting at operating 
temperature. 
There is an ideal bearing setting value for every application. To 
achieve this condition, the bearing setting must take into account 
deﬂection under load (radial + axial) as well as thermal expansions 
and material used.

Setting methods
Upper and lower limits of bearing setting values are determined 
by consideration of the following factors:
 • Application type.
 • Duty cycle/loading.
 • Operational features of adjacent mechanical drive 
elements.
 • Changes in bearing setting due to temperature differentials 
and deﬂections.
 • Size of bearing and method of obtaining bearing setting.
 • Lubrication method.
 • Housing and shaft material.
The setting value to be applied during assembly will depend on 
any changes that may occur during operation. In the absence of 
experience with bearings of similar size and operating conditions, 
a bearing setting range suggestion should be obtained from your 
Timken engineer.

(1)Does not apply to TNASW and TNASWE type bearings. 
(2)Example: If the minimum inner ring bore is 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) the suggested shaft size = 76.238 mm (3.0015 in.) to 76.225 mm (3.0010 in.)  
 for an inner ring ﬁt of 0.038 mm (0.0015 in.) tight to 0.012 mm (0.0005 in.) tight. 
(3)For inner ring bores between 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) and 101.600 mm (4.0000 in.) use a minimum ﬁt of 0.025 mm (0.0001 in.) tight.

Tolerances for housing bore and shaft diameters are shown 
as variance from nominal bearing dimension. When one ring is 
piloted by the housing, sufﬁcient clearances must be allowed at 
the outside diameter of the other ring as well as at the bore of both 
rings to prevent cross-loading of the rollers. For most applications, 
this clearance is approximately 1⁄16 in. (1.588 mm, 0.0625 in.).


OPERATING TEMPERATURES
 TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  47
OPERATING TEMPERATURES
Bearings operate in a wide range of applications and environments. 
In most cases, bearing operating temperature is not an issue. 
Some applications, however, operate at extreme speeds or in 
extreme temperature environments. In these cases, care must 
be taken not to exceed the temperature limits of the bearing. 
Minimum temperature limits are primarily based on lubricant 
capability. Maximum temperature limits are most often based 
on material and/or lubricant constraints, but also may be based 
on accuracy requirements of the equipment that the bearings 
are built into. These constraints/limitations are discussed below.
BEARING MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
Standard bearing steels with a standard heat treatment cannot 
maintain a minimum hardness of 58 HRC much above 120° C 
(250° F).  
Dimensional stability of Timken bearings is managed through the 
proper selection of an appropriate heat-treat process. Standard 
Timken tapered roller and ball bearings are dimensionally stabilized 
from -54° C (-65° F) up to 120° C (250° F), while standard spherical 
roller bearings are dimensionally stabilized up to 200° C (392° F) and 
standard cylindrical roller bearings are stabilized up to 150° C 
(302° F). Upon request, these bearings can be ordered to higher 
levels of stability as listed below. These designations are in 
agreement with DIN Standard 623.

With dimensionally stabilized product, there still may be some 
changes in dimensions during service as a result of microstructural 
transformations. These transformations include the continued 
tempering of martensite and decomposition of retained austenite. 
The magnitude of change depends on the operating temperature, 
the time at temperature and the composition and heat-treatment of 
the steel.
Temperatures exceeding the limits shown in table 33 require 
special high-temperature steel. Consult your Timken engineer for 
availability of specific part numbers for non-standard heat 
stability or high-temperature steel grades.
Suggested materials for use in balls, rings and rollers at various 
operating temperatures are listed in table 34. Also listed are 
chemical composition recommendations, hardness recommendations and dimensional stability information.  
Operating temperature affects lubricant ﬁlm thickness and setting, 
both of which directly influence bearing life. Extremely high 
temperatures can result in a reduced ﬁlm thickness that can lead 
to asperity contact between contacting surfaces.
Operating temperature also can affect performance of cages, 
seals and shields, which in turn can affect bearing performance. 
Materials for these components and their operating temperature 
ranges are shown in table 35.
LUBRICATION LIMITATIONS
Starting torque in grease-lubricated applications typically increases 
signiﬁcantly at cold temperatures. Starting torque is not primarily 
a function of the consistency or channel properties of the grease. 
Most often, it is a function of the rheological properties of the grease. 
The high-temperature limit for greases is generally a function of the 
thermal and oxidation stability of the base oil in the grease and the 
effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors.   
See the LUBRICATION AND SEALS section on page 55 for more 
information on lubrication limitations.
EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The equipment designer must evaluate the effects of temperature 
on the performance of the equipment being designed. Precision 
machine tool spindles, for example, can be very sensitive to thermal 
expansions. For some spindles, it is important that the temperature 
rise over ambient be held to 20° C to 35° C (36° F to 45° F). 
Most industrial equipment can operate at considerably higher 
temperatures. Thermal ratings on gear drives, for example, are 
based on 93° C (200° F). Equipment such as gas turbines operates 
continuously at temperatures above 100° C (212° F). Running at high 
temperatures for extended periods of time, however, may affect 
shaft and housing ﬁts, if the shaft and housing are not machined 
and heat-treated properly.  
Although bearings can operate satisfactorily up to 120° C (250° F), 


OPERATING TEMPERATURES
48  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  
an upper temperature limit of 80° C to 95° C (176° F to 203° F) is more 
practical. Higher operating temperatures increase the risk of 
damage from transient temperature spikes. Prototype testing of the 
application can help deﬁne the operating temperature range and 
should be conducted if possible. It is the responsibility of the 
equipment designer to weigh all relevant factors and make the ﬁnal 
determination of satisfactory operating temperature.

OPERATING TEMPERATURES
50  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
Bearing operating temperature is dependent upon a number 
of factors, including heat generation of all contributing heat 
sources, heat ﬂow rate between sources and the ability of the 
system to dissipate the heat. Heat sources include such things as 
bearings, seals, gears, clutches and oil supply. Heat dissipation is 
affected by many factors, including shaft and housing materials 
and designs, lubricant circulation and external environmental 
conditions. These and other factors are discussed in the following 
sections.  
HEAT GENERATION
Under normal operating conditions, most of the torque and heat 
generated by the bearing is caused by the elastohydrodynamic 
losses at the roller/ring contacts.
Heat generation is the product of bearing torque and speed. The 
following equation is used to calculate the heat generated.

Qgen  =  k4n M
If the bearing is tapered, the torque can be calculated using the 
following equation.

= k1G1 (nμ)0.62 (Peq) 0.3
Where:
k1  
=  bearing torque constant

= 2.56 x 10-6 for M in N-m

= 3.54 x 10-5 for M in lbf-in.
k4 
=  0.105 for Qgen in W when M in N-m

=  6.73 x 10-4 for Qgen in Btu/min when M in lbf-in.
HEAT DISSIPATION
The problem of determining the heat ﬂow from a bearing in a 
speciﬁc application is rather complex. In general, it can be said 
that factors affecting the rate of heat dissipation include the 
following:
1.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the housing. This is 
affected by size conﬁguration of the house and any external 
cooling such as fans, water cooling or fan action of the rotating 
components.
2.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the shaft. Any other 
heat sources, such as gears and additional bearings and 
their proximity to the bearing considered, will inﬂuence the 
temperature of the shaft.
3.  The heat carried away by a circulating oil system. 
To what extent nos. 1 and 2 can be controlled will depend on 
the application. The heat-dissipation modes include conduction 
through the system, convection along the inside and outside 
surfaces of the system, as well as radiation exchange to and 
from neighboring structures. In many applications, overall heat 
dissipation can be divided into two categories – heat removed by 
circulating oil and heat removed through the structure. 
Heat dissipation by circulating oil
The amount of heat removed by the lubricant can be controlled 
more easily. In a splash lubrication system, cooling coils may be 
used to control the bulk oil temperature.
The amount of heat carried away in a circulating oil system by 
the lubricant can be approximated from the following equations.

Qoil =  k6 Cpf (o - i)
Where:

  k6  =  1.67 x 10-5 for Qoil in W

=  1.67 x 10-2 for Qoil in Btu/min
If the circulating lubricant is petroleum oil, the heat removed is 
further approximated by the following:

Qoil  =  k5 f (o - i) 
The following factors apply to the heat generation and dissipation 
equations listed on this page.
Where:

  k5 =  28 for Qoil in W when f in L/min and  in °C

=  0.42 for Qoil in Btu/min when f in U.S. pt/min 

 and  in °F

The rotational resistance of a rolling bearing depends on load, 
speed, lubrication conditions and internal bearing characteristics.
The following formulas yield approximations to values of bearing 
running torque. The formulas apply to bearings lubricated by oil. 
For bearings lubricated by grease or oil mist, torque is usually 
lower, although for grease lubrication this depends on amount 
and consistency of the grease. The formulas also assume the 
bearing running torque has stabilized after an initial period 
referred to as running-in.

To help maintain a bearing’s antifriction 
characteristics, lubrication is needed to:
 • Minimize rolling resistance due to 
deformation of the rolling elements 
and raceway under load by separating 
the mating surfaces.
 • Minimize sliding friction occurring 
between rolling elements, raceways and cage.
 • Transfer heat (with oil lubrication).
 • Protect from corrosion and, with grease lubrication, 
from contaminant ingress.


56  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
The wide range of bearing types and operating conditions 
precludes any simple, all-inclusive statement or guideline 
allowing the selection of the proper lubricant. At the design 
level, the ﬁrst consideration is whether oil or grease is best for 
the particular operation. The advantages of oil and grease are 
outlined in the table below. When heat must be carried away 
from the bearing, oil must be used. It is almost always preferred 
for very high-speed applications.

OIL LUBRICATION
Oils used for bearing lubrication should be high-quality mineral 
oils or synthetic oils with similar properties. Selection of the 
proper type of oils depends on bearing speed, load, operating 
temperature and lubrication method. Some features and 
advantages of oil lubrication, in addition to the above are:
 • Oil is a better lubricant for high speeds or high temperatures. It can be cooled to help reduce bearing temperature.
 • It is easier to handle and control the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearing. It is harder to retain in the bearing. 
Lubricant losses may be higher than with grease.
 • Oil can be introduced to the bearing in many ways, such as 
drip-feed, wick-feed, pressurized circulating systems, oil bath 
or air-oil mist. Each is suited for certain types of applications.
 • Oil is easier to keep clean for recirculating systems.
Oil may be introduced to the bearing housing in many ways. 
The most common systems are:
 • Oil bath. The housing is designed to provide a sump 
through which the rolling elements of the bearing will pass. 
Generally, the oil level should be no higher than the center 
point of the lowest rolling element. If speed is high, lower  
oil levels should be used to reduce churning. Gages or  
controlled elevation drains are used to achieve and  
maintain the proper oil level.
 • Circulating system. This system has the advantages of:
• An adequate supply of oil for both cooling and 
lubrication.
• Metered control of the quantity of oil delivered to  
each bearing.
• Removal of contaminants and moisture from the 
bearing by ﬂushing action.
• Suitability for multiple bearing installations.
• Large reservoir, which reduces deterioration. 
Increased lubricant life provides economical 
efﬁciency.
• Incorporation of oil-ﬁltering devices.
• Positive control to deliver the lubricant where needed.
• A typical circulating oil system consists of an oil 
reservoir, pump, piping and ﬁlter. A heat exchange  
may be required.
 • Oil-mist lubrication. Oil-mist lubrication systems are used 
in high-speed, continuous-operation applications. This 
system permits close control of the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearings. The oil may be metered, atomized 
by compressed air and mixed with air, or it may be picked 
up from a reservoir using a venturi effect. In either case, 
the air is ﬁltered and supplied under sufﬁcient pressure to 
assure adequate lubrication of the bearings. Control of this 
type of lubrication system is accomplished by monitoring the 
operating temperatures of the bearings being lubricated. The 
continuous passage of the pressurized air and oil through the 
labyrinth seals used in the system prevents the entrance of 
contaminants from the atmosphere to the system.
The successful operation of this type of system is based 
upon the following factors: 
• Proper location of the lubricant entry ports in relation 
to the bearings being lubricated.
• Avoidance of excessive pressure drops across void 
spaces within the system.
• Proper air pressure and oil quantity ratio to suit the  
particular application.
• Adequate exhaust of the air-oil mist after lubrication 
has been accomplished.

Lubricating oils are commercially available in many forms for 
automotive, industrial, aircraft and other uses. Oils are classiﬁed 
as either petroleum types (reﬁned from crude oil) or synthetic 
types (produced by chemical synthesis).
PETROLEUM OILS 
Petroleum oils are made from a petroleum hydrocarbon derived 
from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. 
Petroleum oils are used for nearly all oil-lubricated applications 
of bearings. 
SYNTHETIC OILS
Synthetic oils cover a broad range of categories and include 
polyalphaoleﬁns, silicones, polyglycols and various esters. In 
general, synthetic oils are less prone to oxidation and can operate 
at extreme hot or cold temperatures. Physical properties, such as 
pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients, tend to vary between oil types; 
use caution when making oil selections.
The polyalphaoleﬁns (PAO) have a hydrocarbon chemistry that 
parallels petroleum oil both in chemical structures and pressureviscosity coefﬁcients. Therefore, PAO oil is mostly used in the 
oil-lubricated applications of bearings when severe temperature 
environments (hot and cold) are encountered or when extended 
lubricant life is required. 
The silicone, ester and polyglycol oils have an oxygen-based 
chemistry that is structurally quite different from petroleum 
oils and PAO oils. This difference has a profound effect on its 
physical properties where pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients can 
be lower compared to mineral and PAO oils. This means that 
these types of synthetic oils may actually generate a smaller 
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁlm thickness than a mineral or PAO 
oil of equal viscosity at operating temperature. Reductions in 
bearing fatigue life and increases in bearing wear could result 
from this reduction of lubricant ﬁlm thickness.
VISCOSITY
The selection of oil viscosity for any bearing application requires 
consideration of several factors: load, speed, bearing setting, 
type of oil and environmental factors. Since oil viscosity varies 
inversely with temperature, a viscosity value must always be 
stated with the temperature at which it was determined. High- 
viscosity oil is used for low-speed or high-ambient-temperature 
applications. Low-viscosity oil is used for high-speed or lowambient-temperature applications.
There are several classiﬁcations of oils based on viscosity grades. 
The most familiar are the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
classiﬁcations for automotive engine and gear oils. The American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) have adopted standard 
viscosity grades for industrial ﬂuids. Fig. 21 shows the viscosity 
comparisons of ISO/ASTM with SAE classiﬁcation systems at 
40° C (104° F).

To ensure “wetting” of the bearings, and to prevent 
possible damage to the rolling elements and rings, it is 
imperative that the oil-mist system be turned on for several 
minutes before the equipment is started. The importance of 
“wetting” the bearing before starting cannot be overstated, 
and it also has particular signiﬁcance for equipment that 
has been idled for extended periods of time.

Industrial EP gear oils should be composed of a highly reﬁned 
petroleum oil-based stock plus appropriate inhibitors and 
additives. They should not contain materials that are corrosive 
or abrasive to bearings. The inhibitors should provide long-term 
protection from oxidation and protect the bearing from corrosion 
in the presence of moisture. The oils should resist foaming in 
service and have good water-separation properties. An EP 
additive protects against scoring under boundary-lubrication 
conditions. The viscosity grades suggested represent a wide 
range. High-temperature and/or slow-speed applications 
generally require the higher viscosity grades. Low temperatures 
and/or high speeds require the use of lower viscosity grades.

GREASE LUBRICATION
Grease lubrication is generally applicable to low-to-moderate 
speed applications that have operating temperatures within the 
limits of the grease. There is no universal anti-friction bearing 
grease. Each grease has limiting properties and characteristics.
Greases consist of a base oil, a thickening agent and additives. 
Conventionally, bearing greases have consisted of petroleum 
base oils thickened to the desired consistency by some form 
of metallic soap. More recently synthetic base oils have been 
used with organic and inorganic thickeners. Table 41 summarizes 
the composition of typical lubricating greases.

Calcium- and aluminum-based greases have excellent water 
resistance and are used in industrial applications where water 
ingress is an issue. Lithium-based greases are multi-purpose and 
are used in industrial applications and wheel bearings. 
Synthetic base oils such as esters, organic esters and silicones 
used with conventional thickeners and additives typically have 
higher maximum operating temperatures than petroleum-based 
greases. Synthetic greases can be designed to operate in 
temperatures from -73° C (-100° F) to 288° C (550° F).
Below are the general characteristics of common thickeners 
used with petroleum base oils.

ester base oils increases the maximum operating temperature 
by approximately 10° C (50° F).
Using polyurea as a thickener for lubricating ﬂuids is one of the 
most signiﬁcant lubrication developments in more than 30 years. 
Polyurea grease performance is outstanding in a wide range of 
bearing applications and, in a relatively short time, it has gained 
acceptance as a factory-packed lubricant for ball bearings.
LOW TEMPERATURES
Starting torque in a grease-lubricated bearing at low temperatures 
can be critical. Some greases may function adequately as long 
as the bearing is operating, but resistance to initial movement 
may be excessive. In certain smaller machines, starting may be 
impossible when very cold. Under such operating circumstances, 
greases containing low-temperature characteristic oils are 
generally required.
If the operating temperature range is wide, synthetic greases 
offer advantages. Synthetic greases are available to provide very 
low starting and running torque at temperatures as low as -73° 
C (-100° F). In certain instances, these greases perform better in 
this respect than oil.
An important point concerning lubricating greases is that the 
starting torque is not necessarily a function of the consistency 
or the channel properties of the grease. Starting torque is more 
a function of the individual rheological properties of a particular 
grease and is best evaluated by application experience.
HIGH TEMPERATURES
The high temperature limit for lubricating greases is generally 
a function of the thermal and oxidation stability of the ﬂuid and 
the effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors. Grease temperature 
ranges are deﬁned by both the dropping point of the grease 
thickener and composition of the base oil. Table 43 shows 
the temperature ranges of various base oils used in grease 
formulations. 
A rule of thumb, developed from years of testing greaselubricated bearings, indicates that grease life is halved for every 
10° C (50° F) increase in temperature. For example, if a particular 
grease provides 2000 hours of life at 90° C (194° F), by raising the 
temperature to 100° C (212° F), reduction in life to approximately 
1000 hours would result. On the other hand, 4000 hours could be 
expected by lowering the temperature to 80° C (176° F).
Thermal stability, oxidation resistance and temperature limitations 


60  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
must be considered when selecting greases for high-temperature 
applications. In non-relubricatable applications, highly reﬁned 
mineral oils or chemically stable synthetic ﬂuids are required 
as the oil component of greases for operation at temperatures 
above 121° C (250° F).
CONTAMINATION
Abrasive Particles
When roller bearings operate in a clean environment, the primary 
cause of damage is the eventual fatigue of the surfaces where 
rolling contact occurs. However, when particle contamination 
enters the bearing system, it is likely to cause damage such as 
bruising, which can shorten bearing life.
When dirt from the environment or metallic wear debris from 
some component in the application are allowed to contaminate 
the lubricant, wear can become the predominant cause of 
bearing damage. If bearing wear becomes signiﬁcant, changes 
will occur to critical bearing dimensions that could adversely 
affect machine operation.
Bearings operating in a contaminated lubricant exhibit a higher 
initial rate of wear than those running in an uncontaminated 
lubricant. With no further contaminant ingress, this wear rate 
quickly diminishes. The contamination particles are reduced 
in size as they pass through the bearing contact area during 
normal operation.
Water
Water and moisture can be particularly conducive to bearing 
damage. Lubricating greases may provide a measure of 
protection from this contamination. Certain greases, such as 
calcium and aluminum-complex, are highly water-resistant.
Sodium-soap greases are water-soluble and should not be used 
in applications involving water.
Either dissolved or suspended water in lubricating oils can exert 
a detrimental inﬂuence on bearing fatigue life. Water can cause 
bearing etching that also can reduce bearing fatigue life. The 
exact mechanism by which water lowers fatigue life is not fully 
understood. It has been suggested that water enters micro-cracks 
in the bearing rings that are caused by repeated stress cycles. 
This leads to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement in the microcracks, reducing the time required for these cracks to propagate 
to an unacceptable-sized spall.
Water-based ﬂuids, such as water glycol and invert emulsions, 
also have shown a reduction in bearing fatigue life. Although 
water from these sources is not the same as contamination, 
the results support the previous discussion concerning watercontaminated lubricants.
GREASE SELECTION
The successful use of bearing grease depends on the physical 
and chemical properties of the lubricant as well as application 
and environmental conditions. Because the choice of grease 
for a particular bearing under certain service conditions is often 
difﬁcult to make, you should consult with your lubricant supplier 
or equipment maker for speciﬁc questions about lubrication 
requirements for your application. You also can contact your 
Timken engineer for general lubrication guidelines for any 
application.
Grease must be carefully selected with regard to its consistency 
at operating temperature. It should not exhibit thickening, 
separation of oil, acid formation or hardening to any marked 
degree. It should be smooth, non-ﬁbrous and entirely free from 
chemically active ingredients. Its dropping point should be 
considerably higher than the operating temperature.

Timken® application-speciﬁc lubricants were developed by leveraging our knowledge of tribology 
and anti-friction bearings, and how these two elements affect overall system performance. Timken 
lubricants help bearings and related components operate effectively in demanding industrial 
operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant additives offer superior protection 
in challenging environments. Table 44 provides an overview of the Timken greases available for 
general applications. Contact your Timken engineer for a more detailed publication on Timken

GREASE USE GUIDELINES
It is important to use the proper amount of grease in the 
application. In typical industrial applications, the bearing cavity 
should be kept approximately one-third to one-half full. Less 
grease may result in the bearing being starved for lubrication. 
More grease may result in churning. Both conditions may result 
in excessive heat generation. As the grease temperature rises, 
viscosity decreases and the grease becomes thinner. This can 
reduce the lubricating effect and increase leakage of the grease 
from the bearing. It also may cause the grease components 
to separate, leading to a general breakdown of the lubricant 
properties. As the grease breaks down, bearing torque increases. 
In the case of excess grease resulting in churning, torque may 
also increase due to the resistance caused by the grease.  
For best results, there should be ample space in the housing to 
allow room for excess grease to be thrown from the bearing. 
However, it is equally important that the grease be retained all 
around the bearing. If a large void exists between the bearings, 
grease closures should be used to prevent the grease from 
leaving the bearing area.
Only in low-speed applications may the housing be entirely ﬁlled 
with grease. This method of lubrication is a safeguard against the 
entry of foreign matter, where sealing provisions are inadequate 
for exclusion of contaminants or moisture.
During periods of non-operation, it is often wise to completely ﬁll 
the housings with grease to protect the bearing surfaces. Prior 
to restarting operation, remove the excess grease and restore 
the proper level.
Applications utilizing grease lubrication should have a grease 
ﬁtting and a vent at opposite ends of the housing near the top. A 
drain plug should be located near the bottom of the housing to 
allow the old grease to purge from the bearing.
Bearings should be relubricated at regular intervals to help 
prevent damage. Relubrication intervals are difﬁcult to determine. 
If plant practice or experience with other applications is not 
available, consult your lubricant supplier.
Timken offers a range of lubricants to help bearings and 
related components operate effectively in demanding industrial 
operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant 
additives offer greater protection in challenging environments. 
Timken also offers a line of single- and multi-point lubricators to 
simplify grease delivery.
Grease application methods
Grease, in general, is easier to use than oil in industrial bearing 
lubrication applications. Most bearings that are initially packed 
with grease require periodic relubrication to operate efﬁciently.
Grease should be packed into the bearing so that it gets between 
the rolling elements – the rollers or balls. For tapered roller 
bearings, forcing grease through the bearing from the large end 
to the small end will ensure proper distribution.
Grease can be easily packed into small- and medium-size 
bearings by hand (ﬁg. 23). In shops where bearings are frequently 
regreased, a mechanical grease packer that forces grease 
through the bearing under pressure may be appropriate (ﬁg. 24). 
Regardless of the method, after packing the internal areas of the 
bearing, a small amount of grease also should be smeared on the 
outside of the rollers or balls.
The two primary considerations that determine the relubrication 
cycle are operating temperature and sealing efﬁciency. High- 
operating-temperature applications generally require more 
frequent regreasing. The less efﬁcient the seals, the greater 
the grease loss and the more frequently grease must be added. 
Grease should be added any time the amount in the bearing 
falls below the desired amount. The grease should be replaced 
when its lubrication properties have been reduced through 
contamination, high temperature, water, oxidation or any other 
factors. For additional information on appropriate regreasing 
cycles, consult with the equipment manufacturer or your Timken 
engineer.

Prelubricated bearings
Prelubricated shielded and sealed bearings are successfully 
used in applications where:
 • Grease might be injurious to other parts of the 
mechanism.
 • Cost and space limitations preclude the use of a grease- 
ﬁlled housing.
 • Housings cannot be kept free of dirt and grit, water or other 
contaminants.
 • Relubrication is impossible or would be a hazard  
to satisfactory use.
Prelubricated bearings are pre-packed with greases that have 
chemical and mechanical stability, and they have demonstrated 
long-life characteristics in rotating bearings. Greases are 
ﬁltered several times to remove all harmful material, and they 
are accurately metered so that each bearing receives the proper 
amount of grease.
CONSISTENCY
Greases may vary in consistency from semi-ﬂuids that are hardly 
thicker than a viscous oil to solid grades almost as hard as a 
soft wood.
Consistency is measured by a penetrometer in which a standard 
weighted cone is dropped into the grease. The distance the cone 
penetrates (measured in tenths of a millimeter in a speciﬁc time) 
is the penetration number.
The National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) classiﬁcation 
of grease consistency is shown below:
TABLE 45. NLGI CLASSIFICATIONS
NLGI Grease Grades
Penetration Number

310-340
265-295
220-250
175-205
130-160
85-115
Grease consistency is not ﬁxed; it normally becomes softer 
when sheared or “worked.” In the laboratory, this “working” is 
accomplished by forcing a perforated plate up and down through 
a closed container of grease. This “working” does not compare 
with the violent shearing action that takes place in a bearing and 
does not necessarily correlate with actual performance.

PART-NUMBERING SYSTEMS FOR RADIAL TAPERED 
ROLLER BEARINGS
HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR PART NUMBER
The part-numbering systems for single-row radial tapered roller bearings (type TS) are 
internationally recognized. Several part-numbering systems have been developed that can be 
classiﬁed according to metric or inch systems. Inch system bearings are normally assigned 
individual part numbers for the inner ring and for the outer ring, whereas ISO (metric) bearings 
are assigned a unique part number for the bearing assembly as a whole, which includes both 
inner and outer ring.
INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEMS
ORIGINAL INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEM
The original system developed by The Timken Company was 
based on a family of bearings designed around a common roller. 
Varying the number of rollers and the angle of the raceways 
allows different bearings to be designed for predominantly radial 
loads (shallow angle) or thrust loads (steep angle).
For example, all the tapered roller bearings in the 500 family use 
the same roller. However, the 595 Series has a steep angle and 24 
rollers while the 525 Series has a shallow angle and 15 rollers.
Individual part numbers are assigned to the inner and outer rings. 
Although there are exceptions, the general rule is that the outer 
ring has a part number that is lower than that of the inner ring.
NOTE: ISO 355 is a dimensional plan for metric tapered roller bearings. See page 72 for more details on ISO 355.
Fig. 25. Part-numbering standards.
BEARING SERIES
In all the part-numbering systems, the term bearing series is 
used to describe bearings having the same basic internal

inner ring (including roller set) can be matched with any outer ring 
within the same series providing that the same type of bearing 
is being used.

ABMA INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEM
The current inch part-numbering system was developed by the 
American Bearing Manufacturers Association (ABMA) to address 
the expansion in the number of new applications and tapered 
roller-bearing designs. This part-numbering system has become 
the international standard for inch-sized bearings.
Section 1 - Series preﬁx
The series preﬁx consists of one or two letters that designate 
the duty class for which the bearing is designed. Additional 
preﬁx letters are available in table 49 on page 74.

The ABMA part-numbering system has been applied only to 
new bearing series designed after its introduction. Other partnumbering systems also are in use including those based on 
the original numbering system and proprietary part numbers for 
special bearings. 
The ABMA part number is divided into ﬁve alphanumeric sections, 
which are described in ﬁg. 26.
Section 2 - Angularity designator
The ﬁrst digit following the preﬁx represents the angle coding as 
determined by the included angle of the outer ring.

Section 3 - Basic series indication
The two or three digits following the angularity designator are 
reserved for the basic series indication. Refer to ABMA standard 
19.2 for more information.
Section 4 - Component designator 
The last two numerical digits indicate the component number.
Section 5 - Modiﬁcation sufﬁx letters
The sufﬁx may consist of one to three letters in pre-arranged 
combinations, indicating modiﬁcations in external form or internal 
arrangement. Table 49 on page 74 lists the most common preﬁx 
and sufﬁx designations.


J-PREFIX
A range of metric bearings originally designed by The Timken 
Company also were included in the ISO 355 plan. These bearings 
are speciﬁcally application-oriented and are designed for optimum 
performance. Depending on application and type of load, thrust 
and/or radial, the bearing with the optimum angle and section can 
be selected. For example, pinion bearings have a steep angle, 
whereas bearings for machine tools are generally designed with 
a shallow angle and a light section. Fig. 29 demonstrates this 
feature for 55 mm (2.1654 in.) bore bearings.
These bearings also are identiﬁed with a J-preﬁx, which indicates 
a metric dimensioned and toleranced bearing.

Indicates application type:

C, D & F  =  general purpose

P

S & T

Section 2 - Inner-ring bore
The inner-ring bore metric diameter is included in the part-number 
designation of both the inner ring and outer rings.
Section 3 - Component designator
Same identiﬁcation as in the ABMA part-numbering system.
METRIC PART-NUMBERING SYSTEMS
J-LINE PART NUMBERS
Some ABMA (inch) part numbers are designed with metric envelope dimensions. The J preﬁx 
letter is used in conjunction with the ABMA part-numbering system to identify metric-dimensioned 
and toleranced inner rings and outer rings. The J-preﬁx is shown before the ABMA preﬁx letters. 
J-Line bearings are referred to as inch bearings in metric bore, O.D. and width.

The original metric part-numbering system for tapered roller bearings was based on the ISO 
15 dimensional plan for radial bearings. A ﬁve-digit part number commencing with numeral 3

Section 1 - Symbol for bearing type

Section 2 - Width series
The bearing width is classiﬁed as 9 and 0 through 3 in increasing 
order of width.
Section 3 - Diameter series
The bearing section height is classiﬁed as 9 and 0 through 3 in 
increasing order of O.D. for a given bore size.
Fig. 31. Original ISO part-numbering system.
Section 4 - Inner-ring bore designation
The last two digits multiplied by ﬁve yield the inner-ring bore 
diameter in millimeters. 
There are two exceptions to this rule:
1. Small bearings where:  02 = 15 mm  

03 = 17 mm 
2. Where the last two digits are preceded by a forward 
slash (/), the last two digits show the actual bore size in 
millimeters. Examples:

32218  = 90 mm bore

30203  = 17 mm bore

329/28  = 28 mm bore


72  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
ISO 355 PART NUMBERING 
As dimensions given by the ISO 15 general plan were not found 
to be optimal for tapered roller bearings, ISO introduced a 
new numbering system for tapered roller bearings in ISO 355. 
The numbering system of ISO 355 uses three alphanumeric 
ﬁelds to deﬁne a dimension series. The bearing part number is 
then deﬁned by adding the inner-ring diameter in mm after the 
dimension series. Although the original metric part numbers were 
assigned a new designation in the ISO 355 plan, the original part 
number is still used.

BEARING ASSEMBLY NUMBERS
An assembly number is assigned on receipt of the ﬁrst order for 
new applications. It is very important for correct function of the 
bearing in a given application that the same assembly number is 
quoted for all subsequent orders. A Timken engineer should be 
consulted if additional information is required on the assembly 
number.
For further explanation of preﬁx and sufﬁx symbols or proprietary part numbers of special bearings, consult your Timken engineer.
The nomenclature for a bearing assembly consists of the innerring part number followed by a ﬁve-digit alphanumeric code, e.g. 
LM48548-902A7. The assembly nomenclature describes the bill 
of material of the assembly.

• Type TSF is a single-row bearing 
with a ﬂ ange on the outer ring. 
• The ﬂ ange is used for axial 
location in a housing. 
• Through-boring of the housing 
results in accurately aligned seats. 
• The ﬂ ange is not normally clamped in 
position. 
• Flanged outer rings can be used with any 
single inner ring from the same series. 
• The most commonly speciﬁ ed inner ring part numbers 
are shown in the tables provided. 
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal 
bearing selection to help ensure suitability, availability 
and the most cost-effective application.

• TSL is a single-row bearing 
with a DUO-FACE PLUS seal 
pressed on to the large rib of the 
inner ring.
• One lip of the DUO-FACE PLUS 
seal operates in the housing 
bore, the other lip seals against the 
hardened and ground surface of the 
outer-ring front face.
• This bearing provides an effective means to 
integrate a seal into grease-lubricated applications 
operating at moderate speeds.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal 
bearing selection to help ensure suitability, availability 
and the most cost-effective application.

• TDO consists of a single-piece (double) 
outer ring and two single inner rings. 
• This conﬁ guration offers a wide 
effective bearing spread to support 
loads created by overturning moments.
• These bearings can be used at ﬁ xed 
positions or allowed to ﬂ oat in the housing 
bore to compensate for shaft expansion.
DOUBLE-OUTER RING CONFIGURATIONS
D sufﬁ x has a groove with oil holes for lubrication 
through the outer ring.
CD
CD sufﬁ x now replaces the DC sufﬁ x listed for 
part numbers in previous publications.
Same features as D sufﬁ x, but CD also has groove 
with oil holes. One lubrication hole is counterbored 
to accept an anti-rotational pin. 
Default conﬁ guration for most series.
• TDO bearings are usually supplied complete with an inner-ring 
spacer as a pre-set assembly.  

• To suit the application duty, the built-in setting value needs to be 
established by your Timken engineer before an order is placed.
• For spacer conﬁ guration information, contact your Timken 
engineer.
• Double outer ring can be used with any single inner ring from 
the same series.
• The tables list regularly speciﬁ ed inner-ring part numbers.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

DOUBLE-ROW • TYPE TDI • TYPE TDIT
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  609
• TDI style consists of a single-piece 
(double) inner ring plus two single 
outer rings.
• It is normally supplied complete 
with an outer-ring spacer as a pre-set 
assembly.
• To suit the application duty, the builtin setting value needs to be established 
by your Timken engineer before an order 
is placed.
• A groove and holes can be supplied in the outerring spacer to allow lubricant to pass from the bearing 
housing. Contact your Timken engineer for spacer 
conﬁ guration information.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution. 
TYPE TDIT
• TDIT is a double inner-ring bearing with a tapered bore.
• It is comprised of a one-piece (double) inner ring and two 
single outer rings.
• TDIT bearings are typically supplied complete with an 
outer-ring spacer as a pre-set assembly. Contact your Timken 
engineer for spacer conﬁ guration information.
• These can be used in ﬁ xed (locating) positions on rotatingshaft applications.
• The tapered inner-ring bore allows for easy removal where 
interference ﬁ ts are necessary and frequent removal of the 
bearing from the shaft is desired. 
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

TYPE TNA
• TNA bearings are non-adjustable, 
double-row bearings that are 
supplied with built-in clearance. 
This results in a speciﬁ ed mounting setting range satisfactory for 
speciﬁ c applications.
• They are similar to type TDO, but the 
inner-ring front faces are extended so that 
they abut, which eliminates the need for the 
inner-ring spacer of a TDO bearing.
• They can be used at either ﬁ xed positions or allowed to ﬂ oat 
in the housing bore to compensate for shaft expansion.
DOUBLE-OUTER RING CONFIGURATIONS
D sufﬁ x has a groove with oil holes for lubrication 
through the outer ring.
CD
CD sufﬁ x now replaces the DC sufﬁ x listed for 
part numbers in previous publications.
Same features as D sufﬁ x, but CD also has groove 
with oil holes. One lubrication hole is counterbored 
to accept an anti-rotational pin. 
Default conﬁ guration for most series.
• For desired ﬁ tting practice and resultant mounted setting 
range information, contact your Timken engineer.
• If a closer control of mounted setting range is required, type 
TDO bearing assembly is recommended.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

• TNASW double-row bearings are a 
variant of type TNA, having chamfers 
and slots on the front face of the 
inner ring.
• TNASWE has an extended inner ring face.
• Slots on the inner ring provide lubrication.
• Cone front faces are extended, eliminating the 
need for a separate cone spacer. 
• TNASW and TNASWE bearings are supplied with a built-in 
clearance, which results in a speciﬁ ed mounted setting 
range satisfactory for most applications. 
• Types TNASW and TNASWE provide a solution for ﬁ xed 
or ﬂ oating bearing applications.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

• There are two basic mounting arrangements 
for single-row spacer assemblies: 
2TS-DM
2TS-IM
SR
2S
• Type 2TS-IM (indirect mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings with  

an inner-ring and outer-ring spacer. In some  

applications, the outer-ring spacer is replaced  

by a shoulder in the bearing housing.
• Type 2TS-DM (direct mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings, with 

cone (inner-ring) backfaces abutting and an  

outer-ring spacer. They are generally used  

at ﬁ xed (locating) positions on rotating shaft  

applications.
• Type 2S - Two single-row assembly
Supplied complete with inner-ring and outerring spacers to give a pre-determined bearing 
setting when assembled. The setting range can 
be speciﬁ ed to suit the application. Type 2S has 
an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring, which also 
serves as the cup spacer, to give axial location in 
a through-bored housing.
• Type SR - Set-Right assembly
Type SR is made to a standard setting range, 
based on Timken’s Set-Right automated 
setting technique, suitable for most industrial 
applications. It is equipped with two spacers 
and an optional snap-ring that may be used 
for axial location.
• Along with the standard 2TS types, there are two 
specialty double-row assemblies available:

TAPERED ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
Overview: Timken® thrust bearings are built to handle high thrust loads and 
heavy shock. The distinctive on-apex design characteristic of tapered roller 
thrust bearings ensures true rolling motion, which reduces roller sliding and 
provides a smoother, cooler-running bearing than other thrust types. Available 
in a wide range of sizes and design styles, these bearings ﬁ t many types of 
machinery in the industrial and automotive markets.
•  Bore Sizes: 16.1 mm - 1550.0 mm (0.6337 in. - 61.0236 in.)
•  Industries: Aggregate, rubber and plastics, metals, 
oil, gas and power generation. 
•  Applications: Cone crushers, crane 
hooks, oil well swivels, top drives, 
extruders, pulverizer drives, 
rolling mills, machine tool 
spindles and tables, drilling 
rig hydraulic heads, gear 
boxes and pre-heater fans.
•  Beneﬁ ts: High performance and application 
ﬂ exibility versus other 
non-tapered bearing 
types. Large range of 
product offerings.


THRUST  
734  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
TAPERED ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
Timken tapered roller thrust bearings include conical rollers for true rolling motion. These 
bearings are engineered so that the rollers and raceway converge at a common apex point, 
which is on the center line of the bearing. Seating force between the rib and roller helps provide 
positive roller guidance. 
Timken manufactures several types of heavy-duty tapered roller thrust bearings: standard 
(TTHD), V-ﬂat (TTHDFL) and self-aligning V-ﬂat (TTVS). Timken also offers TTSP and TTC, lightduty thrust bearings designed for oscillating applications.
TTHD
The TTHD design has an identical pair of hardened and ground steel rings with tapered raceways. 
Because both rings have the same bore and O.D., housings should be designed to clear the O.D. 
of rotating rings and shafts stepped to clear the bore of stationary rings. Controlled-contour 
tapered rollers are used and equally spaced by a cage. All components are separable. Most 
TTHD bearings are supplied with case-carburized components, which are well-suited for 
applications where extremely high thrust loads and heavy shock may be encountered. For very 
low-speed applications with unusually high loading, TTHD bearings can be supplied with a full 
complement of rollers. Extensively used in numerous applications, including oil well swivels, 
top drives, pulp reﬁners, extruders and gearboxes. Applications for full-complement bearings 
should be reviewed by your Timken engineer to help ensure selection of the proper bearing. 
TTHDFL
The TTHDFL combines the outstanding features of tapered and cylindrical roller bearings, offering 
the highest possible capacity of any thrust bearing of its size. The V-ﬂat design includes one 
ﬂat ring and one ring having a tapered raceway matching the rollers. These bearings maximize 
dynamic and static capacity within a given envelope. The design was originally developed for 
screwdown applications in metal rolling mills. They also have been highly successful in heavily 
loaded extruders, cone crushers, top drives and other applications where a wide range of 
operating conditions are found. Most sizes utilize pin-type cages with hardened pins through 
the center of the rollers, allowing closer spacing of the rollers to maximize capacity. Smaller 
sizes have brass cages designed for unidirectional retention of rollers.

Fig. 35. Type TTHDFL.


THRUST 
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   735
TTVS
The TTVS design employs the same basic roller and raceway design as the TTHDFL, except 
the lower ring is in two pieces. The contacting faces of the lower ring are spherically ground, 
permitting self-alignment under conditions of initial misalignment. TTVS bearings should not 
be used if dynamic misalignment (changing under load) is expected. These bearings are found 
in cone crushers, extruders, gear drives and pulp reﬁners.
Fig. 36. Type TTVS.
Fig. 38. Type TTC.
Fig. 39. Type TTCS.
Fig. 40. Type TTCL.
TTSP
Type TTSP thrust bearing is made up of two tapered thrust races, 
rollers, cage and an outside retainer which holds the components 
together during shipping and installation. TTSP bearings are lightduty thrust bearings and are used extensively in the steering pivot 
positions of automotive and other industrial applications.
TTC, TTCS, TTCL
The types TTC, TTCS and TTCL thrust bearings consist of two 
tapered thrust races, rollers, and an outside retainer, but do not 
have a cage. The outside retainer holds the assembly together for 
shipping and installation. Types TTC, TTCS and TTCL bearings are 
thrust bearings speciﬁcally designed for oscillating applications. 
The retainer construction varies between types.

 TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  747
Timken offers a wide range of auxiliary parts for 
use in the mounting of bearing products. Locknuts, 
lockwashers and shims may be used to help ensure 
the proper backing and setting of bearings in 
the application.


748  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
LOCKNUTS, LOCKWASHERS AND TONGUED WASHERS
The designs shown in ﬁgs. 43 to 48 show various methods of 
applying standard locknuts, lockwashers and tongued washers. 
A single locknut and lockwasher can be used to clamp the inner 
ring against a sleeve, shown in ﬁg. 43, or directly against a shaft 
shoulder. A narrow spacer is applied between the front face of the 
inner ring and the lockwasher so that the lockwasher will clear the 
bearing cage by a minimum of 3 mm (0.12 in.). The spacer outside 
diameter should be made a minimum of 6 mm (0.24 in.) smaller 
than the cage inside diameter, but must still provide the suggested 
inner ring backing diameter. Fig. 44 shows another clamped design 
using a single locknut and lockwasher with a double-row bearing 
of either type TDO with inner ring spacer or type TNA. Since no 
cage clearance problem is present, the narrow spacer shown in 
ﬁg. 43 is unnecessary.
Fig. 45, 46, and 47 indicate an adjustable bearing arrangement 
using two locknuts and a lockwasher. These may be used with 
either single- or double-row bearings of the types permitting an 
inner ring adjusted arrangement. The design in ﬁg. 45 allows 
the maximum shaft extension diameter that can be used with a 
shaft thread outside diameter, which will be less than the inner 
ring bore. Fig. 46 shows an alternate design with smaller thread 
diameter and corresponding smaller locknuts and lockwasher. 
The locknut outside diameter, minus two times r, must not be less 
than the suggested inner ring backing diameter. Fig. 47 indicates 
the use of a tongued washer located between the inner locknut 
and inner ring. This is intended for applications where the inner 
rings are applied with loose ﬁts on hardened stationary shafts as 
found in many automotive applications. The hardened tongued 
washers are not sold by The Timken Company.
When space does not permit the use of two locknuts and a 
lockwasher in an adjustable arrangement, and a single locknut 
and a lockwasher are used, then a tongued washer must be 
placed between the inner ring and lockwasher as illustrated in 
ﬁg. 48. This is necessary to provide adequate backing for the inner 
ring, in most cases, and to prevent damage to the lockwasher if 
the inner ring should creep on the shaft. The tongued washers 
are available from The Timken Company.
