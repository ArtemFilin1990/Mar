Sealed spherical roller bearings
Features
Spherical roller bearings are double row, self-retaining units 
comprising solid outer rings with a concave raceway, solid inner 
rings and barrel rollers with cages.
The symmetrical barrel rollers orient themselves freely on
the concave outer ring raceway. As a result, shaft flexing and 
misalignment of the bearing seats are compensated.
Sealed spherical roller bearings are characterised by having sealing 
shields mounted on the external edge of both sides of the bearing. 
These protect against particles entering the bearing and act as
a barrier against the lubricant leaving the bearing.
Sealed spherical roller bearings offer many benefits for
a wide range of applications:
■longer operating life of the bearing
■lower grease consumption and disposal costs
■fewer expensive relubrication systems required
■reduced maintenance outlay
■Schaeffler’s reconditioning service is available for
outside diameters 160 mm
■environmentally friendly characteristics.
They have the following properties:
■very high basic dynamic and static load ratings
■contact seal
■bearing materials dimensionally stabilised up to +200 °C (S1)
■two different sealing materials
■angular adjustment facility 0,5° from the central position
■standard dimensions in many cases; extra-wide bearings
have a WS prefix
■standard greases
■limiting speed ng depending on the grease and grease fill level
■X-life quality.
Sealed spherical roller bearings are suitable for areas of operation 
such as continuous casting plant, conveyor belts, elevator plant or 
the food industry.


X-life is the premium brand that identifies particularly high 
performance products under the INA and FAG brands. They are 
characterised by longer rating life and operating life.
This improved performance results from the use of state of the art 
manufacturing techniques and improved internal constructions. 
Products identified as the X-life premium brand have an increase
in the basic dynamic load rating.
At Schaeffler, basic load ratings are systematically calculated using 
the “Method to investigate rolling bearing rating life” procedure.
This describes all calculation and test methods that are necessary
in order to determine all the reference values that influence
rating life. This procedure has been certified by Germanischer Lloyd 
(GL-CER-002-2015).

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Seal materials
Two different proven elastomers are available to choose from
when selecting the material:
■nitrile rubber (NBR), suffix 2RSR
■fluoro rubber (FKM, FPM), suffix 2VSR.
Nitrile rubber (NBR)
■Suitable for temperatures from –30 °C to+100 °C
■Standard for series 222, 223 and 231
■Standard for use with the lubricant Arcanol LOAD400 
recommended by Schaeffler for a temperature range of
–20 °C to +130 °C, grease filling level 25% to 40%;
other greases available on request.
Fluoro rubber (FKM, FPM)
■Suitable for temperatures from –20 °C to +200 °C
■Standard for series 240 and 241
■Standard for use with the lubricant Arcanol TEMP120 
recommended by Schaeffler for a temperature range of
–30 °C to +180 °C, grease filling level 55% to 65%;
other greases available on request.
Seals made of fluoro rubber (FKM, FPM)  are made from particularly 
high performance materials that may release vapour when heated to 
approx. +300 °C. This may occur if, for example, a welding torch
is used to dismount the bearing. In these cases, please refer to
the relevant safety instructions which are available on request.


Sealing concepts
The sealed spherical roller bearings are fitted with different sealing 
concepts depending on the size. This ensures that a reliable working 
seal is achieved for each bearing size.
Smaller diameter sealed spherical roller bearings are sometimes 
wider than standard bearings. In spite of the lateral sealing shields, 
it was possible to achieve a high degree of swivel motion and
the same basic load ratings as for unsealed spherical roller bearings. 
Extra-wide spherical roller bearings are indicated by the prefix WS 
(WS = Wide Size).
The comparison between a sealed spherical roller bearing and
an unsealed basic bearing such as a 22212 is shown in Figure 2.

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Sealing concept 1
(outside diameter  160 mm)
Sealed spherical roller bearings with a pressed-in sheet steel seal 
with elastomer coating are supplied if the outside diameter of
the spherical roller bearing is less than or equal to 160 mm, Figure 3.

Sealing concept 2
(160 mm  outside diameter
 320 mm)
If the outside diameter of the spherical roller bearing is between 
160 mm and 320 mm, a snapped-in seal is always supplied.
The sealing shield is made from sheet steel with an elastomer 
coating. The sealing shield is pressed into a groove in the outer ring 
and is thus self-retaining, Figure 5. Most spherical roller bearings 
have standard ISO dimensions; extra-wide bearings are indicated by 
the prefix WS (WS = Wide Size).

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Sealing concept 3
(outside diameter  320 mm)
Two sealing concepts are used for outside diameters  320 mm.
The bearing size at which the sealing concept switches from one to 
the other depends on the series. Sealing concept 3 is used more 
frequently for smaller bearings than sealing concept 4.
In sealing concept 3, the bearing seal is achieved using a sealing 
shield and a retaining ring. The elastomer-coated sheet steel sealing 
shield is axially located in the outer ring with a retaining ring, 
Figure 7.
Sealed spherical roller bearings with this sealing concept have 
standard ISO dimensions.

Sealing concept 4
In sealing concept 4, the sealing shield consists of an elastomer 
sealing lip attached to a steel washer. The sealing shield is fixed to 
the outer ring with screws, Figure 9. Sealed spherical roller bearings 
with this sealing concept have standard ISO dimensions.

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Outer ring variants
Sealed spherical roller bearings have a circumferential groove and 
three lubrication holes in the outer ring as standard (no suffix).
This allows easy relubrication. In some applications, relubrication
is not required. In this case, a closed outer ring can be requested 
using the suffix H40.
Outer ring options
Cages
Sealed spherical roller bearings have a sheet steel cage as
standard (no suffix) or a solid brass cage (suffix MB, MB1).
A polyamide cage can be used in special cases (suffix TVPA, TVPB).
Internal clearance
Sealed spherical roller bearings with cylindrical and tapered bore are 
manufactured as standard with the internal clearance CN (no suffix). 
These bearings are also available on request with reduced internal 
clearance C2, or larger internal clearances C3 and C4.
The required internal clearance depends on the specific application 
and installation situation.
In some applications with conical shaft seats, it may be necessary for 
the internal clearance of the sealed spherical roller bearing to be 
more accurate than the internal clearance groups allow. In this case, 
there is an option for ordering the sealed bearing with a specific 
actual internal clearance using the suffix J15D. With this suffix,
the actual internal clearance is permanently written on the outer ring 
and the packaging which means it remains with the bearing even 
after extended periods of storage or multiple relocations.

11
Lubricating greases
Sealed spherical roller bearings are always supplied greased
and sealed. This ensures that the bearing is correctly lubricated
from the outset and no contaminants can enter the bearing
from the outside.
Two greases are available as standard which have proven themselves in practice and are used in many instances.
Arcanol LOAD400 (suffix L016) is a grease that is also suitable for 
high demands and shocks. It is used as standard in combination 
with NBR seals (suffix 2RSR): a special suffix is not required in
this instance.
Arcanol TEMP120 (suffix L195) is a grease that is also suitable for 
increased temperatures and loads. Bearings with an FKM seal 
(suffix 2VSR) are lubricated as standard with this grease. In this 
instance, where the bearing has a suffix of 2VSR, the special suffix 
for the grease TEMP120 is not used.
Other greases are available for specific applications.
In these instances, Schaeffler can draw on a wide range of proven 
greases. If the standard grease does not meet your requirements, 
please raise this with your Schaeffler contact.
Further information
Further information on greases is available in:
■TPI 168, Rolling Bearing Greases Arcanol
■TPI 176, Lubrication of Rolling Bearings.
Adapter sleeves
The Schaeffler adapter sleeves have been adapted specially for
the sealed spherical roller bearings in order to fulfil the particular 
requirements of these designs.
For sealed spherical roller bearings, please use the adapter sleeves 
with the suffix T, e.g. H24026-T.
Appropriate adapter sleeves for the relevant spherical roller bearing 
can be found in the dimension tables, page 20 onwards.

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Housings
Sealed spherical roller bearings can in many cases be mounted in 
our split FAG plummer block housings. The housings are specifically 
designed for the location of spherical roller bearings.
Split FAG plummer block housings and the associated bearings form 
bearing arrangement units that can be matched to a wide range
of requirements through the specific selection of the housing seal 
design, lubrication type, and bearing mounting.
The suitable housing for your sealed FAG spherical roller bearing can 
be found in the catalogue GK 1, Bearing Housings.
In order to ensure selection of the correct combination of
housing and bearing when using sealed spherical roller bearings, 
please contact Schaeffler.
Hydraulic nut HYDNUT-E
The new Schaeffler hydraulic nut HYDNUT-E can be used for easy and 
reliable mounting of sealed spherical roller bearings with tapered 
bore. The HYDNUT-E is a further development of the proven HYDNUT. 
The displacement distance can be precisely determined using
a dial gauge mounted in the press ring. This method ensures safe 
installation, especially for sealed rolling bearings, and precise 
adjustment of the internal clearance, particularly when combined 
with the specific actual radial internal clearance (suffix J15D).
In addition to this, the HYDNUT-E has many useful new features
such as a safety marking to indicate the maximum stroke or easy 
dismounting using extraction screws.

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Potential savings
In continuous slab casting plants, sealed spherical roller bearings 
are mounted as locating bearings and as non-locating bearings, 
Figure 13.
 Locating bearing
 Non-locating bearing
Figure 13
Mounting example
00019129
00019129


15
The following comparison from the continuous casting sector
shows the savings that are possible by the use of sealed spherical 
roller bearings instead of open bearings.
The grease costs for relubrication of an open bearing and a sealed 
bearing (seal lubrication of the housing) were taken into 
consideration along with the specific disposal and separation
of the grease from the cooling circuit.
Due to the lower maintenance outlay and the generally longer life
of the sealed spherical roller bearing, the higher purchase price 
compared to the open bearing is recouped after only a short time.
An example of the cost ratio in the life cycle of a sealed and an open 
bearing for a selected bearing position in a bearing position in a continuous casting plant (bearing price for the open bearing = 100%)
is shown in Figure 14. The cost ratio and its development over time
is decisively dependent on the bearing size.

Sealed spherical roller bearings
Rolling bearing reconditioning
During the maintenance of machinery and plant, many rolling 
bearings are taken out of service and replaced by new ones
as a precaution. In some cases, this safety-conscious approach 
blocks any appreciation of the potential cost savings. The fact is: 
reconditioned bearings generally give the same performance as
new ones.
The reconditioning of rolling bearings and rolling bearing units is
one of the core competences of the service arm of Schaeffler and
is offered at several certified locations worldwide. Our services
for rolling bearings of all types apply irrespective of manufacturer 
and are not restricted to Schaeffler products.
Schaeffler is able to recondition and modify rolling bearings with
an outside diameter up to 4 250 mm, Figure 15. Schaeffler is thus
an expert partner for customers from a very wide range of industrial 
sectors such as general and special machine building, steel and 
aluminium, pulp and paper production, wind power, shipbuilding, 
private and public railways, and mining.

Continuous casting plants
In continuous casting plants, the cast strand is supported by rolls.
In order to restrict deflection, the rolls are supported at several 
points along their length by rolling bearings.
These bearings are subjected to high loads, low speeds, spray water 
and high temperatures. Spherical roller bearings of sealed design 
are used to support the rolls, Figure 1.
Requirements
The demands on the design are:
■high static load carrying capacity
■maximum resistance to the ingress of foreign matter.

Design solution
Sealed spherical roller bearings E1 offer a high standard of 
reliability, cost-efficiency and technical performance capacity in
the metal-producing and metal-processing industry.
Due to the particularly compact bearing seals in series 240 and 241, 
the internal construction used can be the same as in the open type, 
Figure 2. The advantages of the field tested X-life design are now
also accessible for sealed spherical roller bearings. The external 
dimensions of course remain identical to those of the unsealed 
variant. The extremely reliable sealing arrangement using a high 
temperature elastomer (FKM) and a special high temperature 
lubricant allows a longer bearing operating life, leading to higher 
machine availability and thus to greater added value.
The maintenance-friendly sealing concept of series 240 and 241 
also contributes to rapid amortisation.
For the specific applications, the grease operating life as well as
the relubrication quantity and the service life must be checked.

Elevator systems
Due to their optimised bearing kinematics and minimal frictional 
torque, sealed spherical roller bearings are an ideal choice for use in 
elevator plant, Figure 1.
Requirements
The demands on the design are:
■a low-maintenance bearing arrangement
■maximum operating life.

29
Design solution
The extremely reliable sealing arrangement using an elastomer 
already subjected to field tests allows extended operating life and 
thus a possibility of approaching freedom from maintenance.
The consistently very high basic load ratings of the spherical roller 
bearings also permit downsizing of existing bearing arrangements or 
in new designs. We are responding to the increasing requirements
in terms of travel and travel speed of elevators with our sealed 
spherical roller bearings with high basic load ratings and smooth 
running characteristics, Figure 2.
Furthermore, a particularly low noise level can be achieved by 
ordering specially developed low noise designs with, for example, 
rollers with special surface and waviness properties (suffix T45C)
or a different grease such as L055.
For the specific applications, the grease operating life as well as
the relubrication quantity and the service life must be checked.
