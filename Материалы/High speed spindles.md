GMN hybrid ball bearings 
Hybrid ball bearings are characterized by a combination of materials; 
bearing steel (inner and outer rings) and ceramic (balls). 
The material-based characteristics of ceramic balls (in comparison to 
bearings with steel balls) offer clear performance improvements in 
machine operation, especially under critical conditions. 
Material
Ceramic: Silicon nitride Si3N4
Material characteristics
·	Low affinity to 100Cr6
·	Low friction coefficient
·	Low heat conductivity
·	Corrosion resistance
·	Non magnetic
·	Electrically insulating
Use of the highest quality components is the basis for the outstanding performance and long service life exhibited by GMN 
products. 
Almost all spindles are equipped with GMN high precision ball 
bearings. These ensure reliable operation, smooth running and 
long service life.
Spindle technology from GMN is the result of the highest demands 
on quality – from development to production. 
Minimal tolerances for dimension, shape and running accuracy 
produce maximum performance capability, long service life and 
are defined by international (ISO 492) and national (DIN 620) 
standards.
GMN high precision ball bearings are produced in precision 
classes P4–P2 as well as ABEC 7–ABEC 9.
GMN precision classes HG (high accurate) and UP (ultra precision) 
attain still greater levels of accuracy with even lower dimensional 
tolerances.

Advantages 
Longer service life
Because of their material characteristics, hybrid bearings attain 
more than twice the service life of steel bearings.
Machine operation time is significantly increased.
Higher speeds
Due to their tribological characteristics and lower mass forces, 
speed increases – in comparison to bearings with steel balls – 
of up to 30% can be attained.
Low-cost lubrication
The maximum speed for grease and oil lubrication is increased.
Therefore grease lubrication can frequently be used instead of 
cost-intensive oil lubrication.
Higher rigidity
The characteristics of the materials improve both, radial and axial 
rigidity. The advantages are increased accuracy and a higher frequency for critical resonance.
Improved processing accuracy 
Higher bearing rigidity, reduced thermal expansion and lower vibration excitation make it possible to achieve maximum processing accuracy.

Permanent grease lubrication with air purge
GMN grease-lubricated spindle bearings ensure reliable, maintenance free operation over the bearing's entire service lifetime.
The high-performance greases selected by GMN to lubricate bearings are optimized in quantity and quality for the service lifetimes 
of the installed GMN ball bearings.
A re-lubrication of the spindle bearing is not necessary.
Permanent grease lubrication is characterized by low technical 
overhead and low life-cycle costs: 
· Maintenance free
· Simplified system design
· Reduced operating costs (no oil consumption)
· No oil residues
· Environmentally friendly
Air purge (standard)
GMN standard series spindles with permanent grease lubrication 
are equipped with an air purge.
· Protection against spindle contamination
A continuous supply of compressed air through the ring gap between shaft and housing seals the working side of the spindle 
against contamination by abrasive particles and liquids – and also 
ensures long service life even under harsh operating conditions.

Cooling
Motor and bearing cooling
GMN high-speed spindles are equipped with an effective liquid cooling system. 
Cooling jackets in the vicinity of shaft bearings and on the spindle 
motor minimize increases in operating temperature, especially 
those increases caused by bearing friction and motor energy losses.
The reduction of operationally-induced heat development increases 
available spindle output performance, ensures maximum productivity and high processing quality.

Coolant temperature
The spindle's maximum output performance is reached within a 
specified coolant temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C.
The actual performance attainable depends on the coolant's temperature and the medium used.
High processing accuracy
Keeping coolant temperature differences small reduces axial shaft 
displacement and improves processing accuracy. 
GMN cooling units with high regulation accuracy are available as 
accessories (page 82).

Requirements
Motor spindles with improved performance, rigidity and reliability 
are the essential prerequisites for economical milling production 
in many fields of application. 
Depending on the processing task, it is important that a broad 
spectrum of different tools can be employed to the full extent of 
their performance capabilities: 
Large tools demand high power at relatively low speeds, whereas 
a relatively low power demand is often sufficient for small tools. 
These diverse requirements can be substantially covered by a single 
spindle model with GMN high-speed spindles. They provide – depending on model size – high torque and thus make it possible to 
achieve high processing performance even in the low speed range. 
This is made possible by asynchronous and synchronous motors 
especially designed for this field of application as well as by efficient liquid cooling of the spindles. The motors have high power 
density and achieve a very good efficiency rating.
Power and torque characteristics
In this catalog, GMN offers high speed spindles in a broad spectrum of model sizes and power ratings. 
Various motor performance characteristics are available to meet 
your requirements.
Models with a large weak-field area are an economical solution 
when the power demand in the upper speed range is not very high.

Synchronous motor with permanent magnet rotor 
Where high demands are made on the spindle's performance capabilities, or for very high speeds (UHS spindles), GMN optionally 
employs synchronous motors with permanent magnet rotors.
·	Very high power and torque density 
·	Low rotor losses (no slip) reduce load-dependent  
	 heat development in critical areas of the spindle.
·	The permanent magnet rotor permits realization of very 
	 rigid spindle shafts with high critical speed.
·	Appropriate CFRP bandaging make it possible to achieve
	 very high rotor circumferential speeds 
	 (circumferential speed up to 260 m/s for UHS spindles).

GMN high-speed spindles are designed for processing procedures 
carried out at extremely high cutting speeds.
Their performance profiles indicate the maximum speed values 
that can be achieved with consideration for the greatest possible 
running smoothness.
· Applicable for short tools. 
· Even better balancing may be necessary for tools with a long overhang or where  
	 exceptionally high processing quality is required.
· Also applicable for spindles with grinding mandrel receiver 
	 (with comparable flat face diameter).
Imbalance spindle vibrations 
Imbalanced mass distribution of rotating parts (spindle shaft, tool) 
with increasing speed induces sinusoidal imbalance vibrations 
which may be detrimental to machine operation and the quality of 
desired processing results. 
Shaft
The highest processing quality in the production of GMN spindle 
shafts ensures a uniform mass distribution and minimum imbalance vibrations at maximum speeds. 
Tool
Speed-intensive production processes demand particular attention to imbalance testing and may require the balancing of production-relevant tools in order to maintain vibration tolerances.
Long-term, comprehensive practical experience with precision 
milling has resulted in  specific guidelines for maximum imbalance vibrations that still permit GMN spindles to provide optimal 
performance.

Spindle resonance vibrations
The resonance of rotating systems produces critical speed ranges 
in which extreme vibrations occur.
The use of tool attachments for machine operation can lower the 
critical speed range of the spindle/tool system and thus lead to a 
reduction of the maximum operating speed.
Vibration calculation 
If tools with unusual dimensions or heavy weight are to be used, 
GMN offers to calculate the static and dynamic behavior of the envisioned spindle/tool system under operational conditions.
The proper analysis of calculation results delivers specific information about spindle selection and about tool optimization with consideration for load-dependent bending lines, rigidity, resonance 
and bearing loads.
Vibration monitoring
Vibration monitoring devices detect the spindle's operational 
movements and initiate a fault shutdown if critical values are 
reached in order to maintain the system's mechanical safety.
Detection of vibrations causing wear to the spindle's bearing indicates when additional preventative maintenance is necessary to 
ensure long machine service life. 
The selection and layout of such devices should be done such that 
vibrations caused by other machine components are disregarded.

Tool interfaces
Taper hollow shaft with flat contact face: HSK-C
Because of the very high maximum speed ratings for type 
UHS, a GMN standard with internal taper/flat contact face 
and internal threads has been selected. This ensures a secure connection between shaft and tool over the entire 
speed range for the given spindle.
High-speed spindles in type series HS, HV-X and HSX are 
equipped with the GMN standard – fitting bore/flat contact face and internal threads – that has proven itself over 
many decades.
Taper hollow shafts (HSK) with flat contact faces are standardized per DIN 69893. The various shapes differ with respect to pusher dog recess and collar. Form C has been especially developed for use with manual tool change systems. 
Spindles in type series HV-P/HSP/HSP..g can accept tools 
with taper hollow shafts of form A and C. The HSK interface 
allows these spindles to be operated in both directions of 
rotation.

lubrication oil, are available from GMN. 
Pre-lubrication
Automatic time lapse
1.	 Start pre-lubrication
	 (enable signal to operate the spindle not issued)
2.	Multiple lubrication pulses within short time, depending on 
	 the length of line between spindle and mixing distributor 
	 (pre-lub cycle)
3.	Enable signal following expiration of the pre-lub time
4.	Transition to normal cycle (cycle time) 
	 according to GMN operating instructions
The length of the pre-lub period depends on the length of connected lubrication lines.
(For details: see operating instructions)
Maintenance
Filtration of the oil and air supplies are necessary to ensure the 
unit provides a long-term, consistent lubricating function.
The cartridges intended for a routine maintenance filter change 
are available from GMN.
Lubricant selection
The use of filtered oils with friction and wear reducing additives 
ensures long-term reliable operation of the spindle at maximum 
speeds. 
Detailed specifications for the necessary lubricants as well as rules 
for cycle times and lubrication pressures are provided in the operating instructions included in the delivery complement.

Coolant supply
Reducing the heat caused by operation and obtaining maximum 
spindle performance depend on a reliable supply of coolant in the 
necessary quantity and at the proper temperature (page 11).
GMN cooling units ensure the precise coolant temperature and 
volume regulation necessary to obtain constant low operating 
temperatures.
Highly precise regulation accuracy reduces axial shaft elongations 
caused by temperature fluctuations of the coolant. 
· Coolant: 
	 R407c (FCKW free)
· Coolant temperature: 
	 20 °C – 25 °C
· Regulation accuracy: 
	 - Model T: ± 2 °K
	 - Model F: ± 1 °K 
·	High-precision regulation accuracy (on request): 
	 (for minimal axial spindle shaft elongation)  
	 - Model T: ± 1.2 °K
	 - Model F: ± 0.5 °K
· Permissible ambient temperature: 
	 + 42 °C 
· Connections for multiple spindles (on request)
	 (parallel or series connection)
· Coolant sensor: 
	 Level and flow volume monitoring 
	 with fault alert contact
· Color:
	 - Model F: RAL 5019 (capri blue)
	 - Model T: RAL 9005 (deep black)
	 - Other RAL colors (on request)
1) In addition to high pressure monitoring, also low pressure monitoring of the coolant circuit.
2) At 37 °C ambient temperature and 20 °C water temperature. Performance drops at higher ambient temperatures. 
3) Other voltages and frequencies possible on request.
4) Assumption: Spindle power ≥ 80 kW leads to reduced cooling efficiency from 12% respectively 10% in relation to the spindle power.
