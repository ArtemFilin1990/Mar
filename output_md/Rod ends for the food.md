The food and beverage processing industries 
have unique requirements. Depending on the 
application, equipment has to withstand hot, 
cold or wet environments and has to be able 
to withstand 
• frequent wash downs
• exposure to harsh cleaning agents
• food and liquid contaminants
• a variety of chemicals.
To deal with these challenging operating con-
ditions, specially designed components have 
to be used. 
To provide bearing solutions that will meet 
these challenges, SKF has introduced two 
lines of maintenance-free rod ends, providing 
exceptional corrosion resistance, food and 
beverage compatibility and long service life.
SKF food line rod ends
There are three different series of SKF food 
line rod ends. The SRIKB and SRAKB series 
are characterized by a stainless steel rod end 
housing while rod ends in the lightweight SFIK 
series use a composite housing. All rod ends 
are equipped with a stainless steel inner ring 
and a PTFE composite dry sliding layer.
High performance sliding contact 
surfaces
The sphered counter surface of the stainless 
steel inner ring (X105CrMo17 to EN 10088-
1:1995 or AISI 440 C) is ground and polished. 
The dry sliding layer made of glass fibre rein-
forced polyamide containing PTFE is injection 
moulded between the rod end housing and 
inner ring.
This sliding contact surface combination 
provides low friction and good wear 
resistance.
Operating temperature ranges
SKF’s food line of rod ends can be used at 
temperatures from –40 to +75 °C (–40 to 
+170 °F). However, if the load carrying capac-
ity is fully exploited, the maximum tempera-
ture has to be limited to +50 °C (+120 °F). 
Rod ends with a stainless steel housing
Rod ends with a stainless steel housing are 
available with 
• female thread, SRI(L)KB .. FG series 
(† fig. 1)
• male thread, SRA(L)KB .. FG series 
(† fig. 1)
with the choice between right or left hand 
thread. 
The rod end housings are made of 
X17CrNi16-2 stainless steel (EN 10088-
1:1995 or AISI 431) and have polished out-
side surfaces to improve corrosion resistance 
and facilitate wash downs.
These rod ends provide excellent perform-
ance where alignment movements have to be 
accommodated in a difficult environment.
Rod ends with a composite housing
Rod ends with a composite housing are avail-
able with 
• female thread, SFIK .. FG series († fig. 2)
with the choice between a right or left hand 
thread. 
These lightweight rod end housings are 
made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide 
incorporating a stainless steel threaded insert. 
The non-porous outside surfaces facilitate 
wash downs.
These rod ends provide excellent perform-
ance where alignment movements and mod-
erate loads must be accommodated in a dif-
ficult environment.
