IS YOUR BELT MISSING THE MARK?
When you order belts, do you know how accurate their length is? Are you aware of how much additional maintenance and inefficiency is 
costing your business? OPTIBELT does and that is why we have manufacturing processes that far exceed industry accepted standards.
Identical size v-belts will always vary in length depending on a variety of conditions such as heat, humidity, material composition, etc. 
when manufactured. 
For example a B100 belt the industry accepted length variance is ±13/16 in. in accordance with industry standards. That is a possible 
variance of over 1-1/2 in.! This standard is what belt manufacturers use when measuring their tolerances.
OPTIBELT holds itself to a higher standard. Utilizing OPTIBELT's Rotary Vulcanization manufacturing process and additional quality control 
methods all B100 S=C PLUS belts will vary less than 1/4 in.! This accuracy is unmatched in the industry. 
VB 
Classic v-belts engineered for 
superior performance and 
efficiency.
HVAC POWER

The superstructure is made from a fiber-reinforced rubber mixture. 
The fibers are laid perpendicular to the direction of belt travel and 
stabilize the belt during dynamic operation. The tension cord is a 
high modulus polyamide material embedded in a rubber compound 
and covers the entire width of the ribbed belt. The rib compound is 
characterized by a high wear resistance.

This simplified tensioning method should be used for installation and maintenance tensioning of the belt when the important technical 
data is unavailable and the optimum tension cannot be calculated. This method requires only knowledge of the small pulley diameter 
and the belt section and construction. The gauges themselves may be used to set tensions also when the technical data is known and 
the optimum tension can be calculated.

TENSIONING GAUGES – INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1.	 Select the gauge appropriate to the belt section and construction 
being tensioned. See notes below the simplified tensioning table.
2.	 Figure 2 shows three ways to hold the gauges so that pressure is 
applied to the black pad only.
3.	 Position the gauge on one of the belts on the drive in the middle of 
an accessible span length. Take care to ensure that the gauge is only 
in contact with one of the belts, and that the indicator is pushed down 
into the gauge body. Align the gauge so that its body is parallel with 
the sides of the belt.
4.	 Push slowly and firmly on the black pad. When a CLICK is heard 
and/or felt, stop immediately and remove the gauge carefully to 
avoid disturbing the indicator arm.
5.	 Read the gauge to judge the tension as follows.
6.	 Turn the gauge sideways to ascertain the exact point where the top 
surface of the black indicator crosses the scale.
7.	 Mark this point mentally or with a thumbnail and turn the gauge to 
read the scale.
8.	 Check the tension found against the simplified tensioning table. 
Tighten or slacken the belt, if necessary.
The static tension values shown are calculated for maximum power 
transmission capability per belt and should be applied only when 
accurate drive data is not available.
Calculation Limitations
Wedge belts	
belt speed v = 985 to 8265 feet/min 
Classical belts

Simplified Tensioning Table
To use this table belt construction (standard wrapped or S-TX raw 
edge, molded cogged), and the diameter of the smallest pulley on 
the drive should be known. Note also that the belt tension is high-
er or lower depending on whether the belt is on first installation or 
whether it is being re-tensioned.

INSTALLATION & STORAGE
MAINTENANCE
INSTALL STRG.
MAINTENANCE
Correct design of drives using V-Belts 
ensures long belt life and a high degree 
of operating safety. Premature failure can 
often be traced back to faulty installation 
or main­tenance, thus the following 
recommendations are very important.
SAFETY
Before beginning any maintenance it is 
extremely important that any and all drive 
motors and other drive components are 
completely turned off. Care should be 
taken that these cannot be switched on 
again while work is taking place. This will 
ensure the safety of the maintenance 
workers.
SHEAVES
The grooves should be in good condition, 
free from scores or sharp edges, and all 
dimensions should conform to the relevant 
standard.
ALIGNMENT
Shafts and sheaves should be correctly 
aligned prior to belt installation.
We recommend a maximum tolerance of 
± 1/2° in both planes.
MULTIPLE V-BELT DRIVES
For multiple V-Belt drives it is necessary to 
assemble the belts in matched sets either 
by measurement or by exami­nation of the 
manufacturer’s code numbers or other 
markings. It may also be necessary to 
remeasure the belts if they have been 
stored for any length of time. V-Belts in 
S=C PLUS and SUPER TX M=S construc-
tion may be used in matched sets without 
the need for reference to code marks, 
measure­ment, or re-measurement after 
storage.
INSTALLATION OF THE V-BELTS
The drive center distance should be 
reduced prior to the installation of the 
belts so that they may be fitted without 
undue force. The severe stresses placed 
upon V-Belts if they are forced over the 
pulley flanges can damage the cover 
fabric and the high quality, low stretch 
tension mem­bers.
BELT TENSIONING
The drive should be tensioned (see initial 
installation) correctly and re-tensioned 
(see re-tension) after between 30 minutes 
and 4 hours at full load, to com­pensate 
for the small initial belt stretch and 
“bedding“ into the pulley grooves.
IDLER PULLEYS
Where possible the use of idler pulleys 
should be avoided. If for design reasons, 
such an arrangement is necessary, then 
an inside idler should be used in prefer-
ence to an outside idler. For other details 
refer to our Technical Manual.
MAINTENANCE
It is recommended that V-Belt drives 
should be regularly inspected for loss of 
belt tension, unusual heat build up or 
wear. Re-tension or replace when neces-
sary.
Should an individual belt in a matched set 
require replace­ment for any reason, a 
complete new set must be fitted.
Belts from different manufacturers must not 
be mixed on the same drive.
V-Belts need no special attention. Belt 
dressings must not be used.
SUMMARY
Properly stored V-Belts ensures the belts 
integrity will not change over a period of 
many years (see also DIN 7716). In poor 
storage conditions and with incorrect 
handling, rubber products are, however, 
subject to changes in their integrity. These 
changes can for example, be caused by 
the effects of oxygen, ozone, temperature, 
light, moisture and solvents.
STORAGE AREA
The storage area should be dry, dust free 
and reasonably well ventilated.
V-Belts must not be stored close to 
chemicals, solvents, fuels, lubricants and 
acids etc.
TEMPERATURE
The storage temperature should be 
between +15 °C/+59 °F and +25 
°C/+77 °F. Normally lower temperatu­res 
are not detrimental to V-Belts. Since they 
become very stiff at low temperatures, 
before fitting they should be warmed to a 
temperature of approximately +20 
°C/+68 °F to avoid ruptures and cracks.
Radiators and their supply lines should be 
guarded. The distance between a radiator 
and the stored V-Belts must be at least 
three feet.
LIGHT
V-Belts should be protected against light, 
especially direct sunlight and high 
intensity artificial light having a high ultra 
violet content (ozone formation) such as 
naked fluorescent tubes. Illumination 
utilizing conventional light bulbs is 
advisable.
Wherever possible windows should be 
painted with a red or orange protective 
paint. Under no circumstances should 
blue be used.
OZONE
In order to counteract the harmful effects 
of ozone, ware­houses should not contain 
any ozone producing appli­ances, for 
example fluorescent lights, mercury vapor 
lights or high voltage electrical equip-
ment. Combustion gases and vapors 
which may lead to the formation of ozone 
by photo chemical processes must be 
avoided or eliminated.
MOISTURE
Damp store rooms are unsuitable. Care 
must be taken to ensure that condensation 
does not occur. The most favorable 
relative air humidity is below 65 %.
STORAGE
Storage/stacking stresses can promote 
permanent defor­mation and the formation 
of cracks. Care must be taken to ensure 
that V-Belts are stored without stress.
If V-Belts are stored horizontally and 
stacked upon each other, it is recommend-
ed that the stack height does not exceed 
12 inches to avoid deformation. If, to 
save space, V-Belts are hung, the diame-
ter of the cylinder on which the belts rest 
should be at least ten times the height of 
the belt section.
S=C PLUS and ­Super X-POWER M=S 
(SUPER TX) belts do not have  
to be stored in sets or remeasured before 
sale.
CLEANING
Contaminated V-Belts can be cleaned 
using a 10 : 1 glyce­rine-spirit mixture. 
Benzene, benzol, and turpentine amongst 
others must not be used.
In addition, sharp edged objects, wire 
brushes, emery paper etc. must not be used 
under any circumstances; such action is 
damaging.

WHY CUSTOMERS CHOOSE OPTIBELT
MORE DURABILITY
Customers that have a difficult drive set-up or application where 
standard belts are over-stressed, products such as optibelt’s RED 
POWER often solves these issues.
GREATER EFFICIENCY
Customers seeking to optimize their facilities will discover OPTIBELT’s 
superior wear resistance and high power transfer capacity will 
reduce their yearly costs.
REDUCED MAINTENANCE
When customers are looking to reduce downtime or overall 
maintenance costs, OPTIBELT offers the only maintenance-free belt 
in the industry: RED POWER 3.
OPTIBELT’S INDUSTRY LEADING ADVANTAGES
S=C PLUS (Set-Constant)
Superior than industry standards for a matched-set. Any two S=C 
Plus V-belts are always a matched set regardless of when they 
were manufactured.
CUT TO SIZE WIDTHS
Customers get greater flexibility when they are ordering banded, 
timing or ribbed belts. Every OPTIBELT facility cuts belts to size so 
there is no wait for custom orders from the factory.
METRIC SIZES
OPTIBELT’S international presence make us the leading supplier 
of metric belts in the world.
HVAC POWER
Specific HVAC engineered V-belts can withstand extreme 
temperatures, extend maintenance intervals, are very flexible, 
and have S=C Plus length tolerances.
BLUE POWER: Aramid Cord
BLUE POWER V-belts are the strongest available for heavy 
industrial applications and their high-grip cover is dual 
wrapped for increased durability.
RED POWER: Maintenance-Free
RED POWER 3 is the only maintenance-free belt. The cord is 
made with a custom polymer that keeps the belt tensioned 
throughout its life.
RED POWER belts also offer up to a 50% increase in power 
transfer capacity, are dual wrapped cover for dramatically 
longer belt life, and have S=C Plus length tolerances.
