Lord

THE FIRST
MEDIA-RESISTANT  
FLUROGLIDE®  MEDIA SOLID
HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPHERICAL 
PLAIN BEARINGS
NEW!

---

With the high-performance fabric FLUROGLIDE® an excellent development 
was made years ago in the area of radial spherical plain bearings. 
And now is the next step coming with FLUROGLIDE® MEDIA SOLID?
Reiner Höhn: That’s right. As market leader and specialist in the area of  
stainless steel spherical plain bearings and rod ends, we did everything to 
develop a media-resistant spherical plain bearing.  
How did this happen?
Reiner Höhn: We discovered that spherical plain bearings often suffer  
early wear – because of the various environmental influences and the  
different media resistance. We analysed these problems and developed 
new properties for us. Our new spherical plain bearings are characterised  
by their particularly high tribological capabilities.
What tangible benefits does the customer get from this?
Reiner Höhn: Once more we can extend the life of products considerably – 
especially for uses where the spherical plain bearings are exposed to  
moisture or come into contact with oils and greases. And in addition: We 
can offer the customer completely new, longer maintenance intervals. 
They therefore profit twice. We call this a „Swabian Development“. 
Time for the next  
step towards 
indestructibility
Reiner Höhn is the managing partner for the
two companies FLURO®-Gelenklager GmbH
and Martin Höhn Präzisionsteile GmbH. Thanks to 
his many years‘ experience in managing
produce development and technical sales he
is the ideal contact partner for all technical
challenges the trickier the better. 
We already set the standards years ago with the high-performance fabric 
FLUROGLIDE® – the fabric developed by us exceeds normal fabrics in terms 
of load-bearing capacity many times over.  
Now it is time for the next step: Time for the first media-resistant FLUROGLIDE® 
spherical plain bearings, which are almost indestructible. Resistant against  
moisture, grease, oil. Ready to permanently withstand the hardest requirements. 
In select applications – e.g. in hydraulic rod ends or in vehicle and plant 
constriction – FLUROGLIDE® MEDIA SOLID offers our customers totally new 
standards for swivel and tip movements under the influence of the stated 
media.
FLUROGLIDE® MEDIA SOLID is available in two models: in completely stainless 
steel and in hard chrome. 
É Complete stainless steel 1.4031 
(Aisi 420)
É Inner ring also hard-chromed 
on the running surface
É Outer ring:	 Bearing steel 100Cr6 
É Inner ring:	 Bearing steel 100Cr6 
hard-chromed on the running surface
