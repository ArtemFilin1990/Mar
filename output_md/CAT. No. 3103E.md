Deep Groove Ball Bearings
for High-speed Servo Motors  [Type MA]
Features
1. High Speed and High Reliability
     The cage is made of a resin which is excellent in self lubricating performance, and 
     cage deformation during high-speed operation is reduced by a new high rigid design
     cage (Fig.1). It has achieved dmn value of 1 million.
     * dmn value: dm (rolling element pitch diameter mm) x n (rotational speed min-1)
2. Extended Life of Lubricating Grease
     A grease pockets (Fig. 2) are provided in the outer ring, and the grease is held near 
     the rolling elements to improve the lubricating reliability.
     The new long life grease "ME-1" for motors is adopted (Refer to Table 4 for the properties). 
     (Achieved a life of more than 5 times, compared to general-purpose lithium grease)
3. Low Noise
     Noise level is reduced by the new type resin cage.
     Noise level is 3 dB-A lower compared to the bearing
     with ribbon type metal cage.
"ULTAGE  " (a name created from the combination of "ultimate," signifying refinement,and "stage," signifying NTN's intention
that this series of products be employed in diverse applications) is the general name for NTN's new generation of bearings that
are noted for their industry-leading performance.

The allowable rotational speed refers to the rotational speed where the 
outer ring temperature is 80˚C or less in a constant operating condition at 
an ambient temperature after the standard grease ME-1 is sealed at 15-
20% of the space volume of the bearing, applying a preload (shaft 
diameter d x 1) to the bearing, and performing a run-in operation.
The increase of the bearing temperature differs by the conditions to be 
used (operating load, environmental temperature, rotational speed pattern, 
etc.).  Select an allowable rotational speed as indicated in the catalog with 
a margin.
Please contact NTN if the rotational speed will exceed 80% or more of 
the limitting speed indicated in the bearing dimension table.

Deformation of the new MA resin type cage caused by centrifugal force at high-speeds can be suppressed, 
and enables stable operation.

●Rapid acceleration/
●Deceleration durability performance
●ME-1 Grease properties
●Grease high temperature durability
In the test results of each ULTAGE (MA Type) bearing, the outer ring temperature was 80˚C or less at a dmn value of 1 million.
In the ME-1 grease, a urea compound is used as a thickener,
and synthetic oil as the base oil.
