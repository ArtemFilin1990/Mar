Inner ring
Structure of the Cross-Roller Ring Model RB
●High Rotation Accuracy
The spacer retainer fitting among cross-arrayed rollers
prevents rollers from skewing and the rotation torque from
increasing due to friction between rollers.  Unlike
conventional types using steel sheet retainers, the Cross-
Roller Ring does not cause displacement or locking of
rollers and provides a stable rotation torque.
Since the inner and outer rings are designed to be
separable, the bearing clearance can be adjusted.  In
addition, highly accurate rotary motion is ensured through
adjusting the bearing clearance to provide a preload.
●Easy Handling
The inner and outer rings, which are separable, are
secured to the Cross-Roller Ring body after the rollers and
spacer retainers are installed.  This procedure prevents the
rings from separating from each other.  Thus, it is easy to
handle the rings when installing the Cross-Roller Ring.
●Skewing Prevention
The spacer retainer keeps rollers in their proper position,
thereby preventing them from skewing.  This eliminates
friction between rollers, and therefore secures a stable
rotation torque.
With the Cross-Roller Ring, cylindrical rollers are arranged crosswise, with each roller perpendicular to
the adjacent roller, in a 90゜V groove, separated from each other by a spacer retainer.  This design
allows just one bearing to receive loads in all directions including, radial, axial and moment loads.
Since the Cross-Roller Ring achieves high rigidity despite the minimum possible dimensions of the inner
and outer rings, it is optimal for applications such as joints and swiveling units of industrial robots,
swiveling tables of machining centers, rotary units of manipulators, precision rotary tables, medical
equipment, measuring instruments and IC manufacturing machines.

●Significantly Increased Rigidity (Three to Four times Greater)
Unlike the thin angular ball bearings installed in double rows, the cross array of rollers allows a single Cross-Roller Ring unit to
receive loads in all directions, increasing the rigidity to three to four times greater than the conventional type.

●Large Load Capacity
(1) Compared with the conventional steel sheet retainers, the spacer retainer allows a longer effective contact length of each roller,
thus significantly increasing the load capacity.
The spacer retainer guides rollers by holding them over the entire length of each roller, whereas the conventional type of retainer
supports them only at a point in the center of each roller.  Such one-point contact cannot sufficiently prevent skewing.
(2) In conventional types, the loaded areas are asymmetrical between the outer-ring and the inner-ring sides around the
roller longitudinal axis.  The greater the applied load, the greater the moment becomes, thus causing end-face contact to occur.
This creates frictional resistance, which hinders smooth rotation and quickens wear.

Model RA (Separable Outer Ring
Type for Inner Ring Rotation)
Based on model RB, this model is a light and compact type with the
thinnest possible inner and outer rings.  It is optimal for locations
where weight reduction and downsizing are required, such as the
hand swiveling unit of robots and manipulators.
Model RA-C (Single-Split Type)
The major dimensions of this model are the same as that of
model RA.  Since the outer ring is split at one point to increase the
rigidity of the outer ring, this model can also be used for outer
ring rotation.
Model RB (Separable Outer Ring
Type for Inner Ring Rotation)
Being the basic model of the Cross-Roller Ring, its outer ring is
separable while the inner ring is integrated with the main body.  This
model is used in locations where the rotation accuracy of the
inner ring is required.  Major applications include the index table
swiveling unit of machine tools.
Model RE (Separable Inner Ring
Type for Outer Ring Rotation)
Having the same major dimensions as model RB, this model is used
in locations where the rotation accuracy of the outer ring is
required.
USP-Grade Series of Models
RB/RE
The rotation accuracy of the USP-Grade Series achieves the
ultra precision grade that surpasses the world’s highest accuracy
standards, such as JIS Class 2, ISO Class 2, DIN P2 and
AFBMA ABEC9.
Model RU (Integrated Inner/Outer
Ring Type)
Since the mounting holes are provided, this model does not
require a presser flange or housing.  In addition, because it has an
integrated inner/outer ring structure and is equipped with
washers, its performance is minimally affected by the mounting
procedure, ensuring stable rotation accuracy and torque.
This model can be used for both inner-ring rotation and outer-ring
rotation.

CROSS ROLLER RING OUTLINE
Cross-Roller Ring Product Overview
Static Safety Factor
The basic static load rating C0 refers to the static load with constant direction and magnitude, under which the
calculated contact stress in the center of the contact area between the roller and the raceway where the
maximum load is applied is 4,000 MPa (if the deformation exceeds this level, it will affect the rotation).  This value
is indicated as C0 in the dimensional table.  When a load is statically or dynamically applied, it is necessary to
consider the static safety factor as shown below.
[Static Equivalent Radial Load P0]
The static equivalent radial load of the Cross-Roller Ring is obtained from the following equation.

Fit
[Fit for Models RB, RE and RA]
For the fit for models RB, RE and RA, we recommend using the combinations indicated in Table 20.
[Fit for Model RU]
Model RU does not require a fit in principle.  However, if a certain level of positioning accuracy is required, h7 and H7 are
recommended for the fit.
[Fit for Model RA-C]
For the fit for model RA-C, we recommend using the combinations indicated in Table 22.
[Fit for the USP-Grade Series]
For the fit for the USP-Grade Series of models RB and RE, we recommend using the combinations indicated in Table 21.
Note: For the fit for clearance CC0, avoid an interference because it will cause an excessive preload.  As for the fit when you have selected clearance CC0 for the
joints or swiveling unit of a robot, the combination of g5 and H7 is recommended.
Note: We recommend measuring the inner and outer diameters of the bearing and selecting a slight
interference fit that corresponds to the measurement.

CROSS ROLLER RING OUTLINE
Cross-Roller Ring Product Overview
[Housing]
When determining the thickness of the housing, at least 60% of the
sectional height of the bearing must be secured as a guide.
●Tapped Through Holes
If tapped through holes for removing the inner or outer ring (Fig.
1) are provided, the ring can be removed without causing
damage to the bearing.  When removing the outer ring, do not
press the inner ring, or vise versa.  For the dimensions of the
presser on the side(s), see the shoulder dimensions
indicated in the dimensional table. 
Designing the Housing and the Presser Flange
Since the Cross-Roller Ring is a compact, thin device, special consideration must be given to the rigidity of the
housing and the presser flange.
With types having a separable outer ring, insufficiency in the strength of the housing, the flange or the
presser bolt will result in the inability to evenly hold the inner or outer ring, or will cause deformation of the bearing
when a moment load is applied.  Consequently, the contact area of the rollers will become uneven, causing the
bearing’s performance to significantly deteriorate.
[Examples of installation]
Fig. 2 shows examples of installing the Cross-Roller Ring.

[Presser Flange and Presser Bolt]
When determining the thickness of the presser flange (F) or the clearance of the flange section (S), refer to the dimensions
indicated below as a guide.  As for the number of presser bolts, the greater the number of bolts, the more stable the system
becomes.  As a guide, however, it is advised to select the appropriate number of bolts
indicated in Table 23 and arrange them equidistantly.
F = B×0.5 to B×1.2
H = B
S = 0.5 mm
Even if the shaft and the housing are composed of a light alloy, it is recommended to select
a steel-based material for the presser flange.
When tightening the presser bolts, firmly secure them using a torque wrench or the like so that they will not loosen.
Table 24 shows tightening torques for the housing and presser flanges composed  of typical steel materials with medium hardness.
0
－0.1
[Checking the Parts before Installing Them]
Thoroughly clean the housing and other parts to be installed, and check to determine if deburring is required.
[Installing the Cross-Roller Ring into the Housing or onto the Shaft]
Since the Cross-Roller Ring is a thin-wall bearing type and therefore tends to misalign when it is installed, gradually drive the
product into the housing or onto the shaft by gently hitting it with a plastic hammer while keeping the product horizontal.  Taking care,
continue to hammer until it fully contacts the reference surface.
Note: When installing the inner ring, hammer it, and when installing the outer ring, hammer it.
[Attaching the Presser Flange]
(1) When attaching the presser flange, attach it to the integrated
rotation ring (i.e., inner ring of models RB and RA, or outer ring
of model RE) first.
(2) Place the presser flange onto the Cross-Roller Ring.  Rock
the flange several times to match the bolt holes.
(3) Insert the presser bolts into the holes.  Manually turn the bolts
and make sure they do not display skewing caused by
misalignment of the holes.
(4) Tighten the presser bolts in three to four steps from light to full
tightening by repeatedly securing the bolts in diagonal order.
When tightening the separable inner or outer ring, slightly
turning the integral outer or inner ring will correct the
dislocation between the ring and the body.
Installation Procedure
When installing the Cross-Roller Ring, follow the procedure below.

Cross-Roller Ring Series
Precautions on use
 Handling
 The separable inner or outer ring is fastened in place using special rivets, bolts or nuts when delivered.  When installing it to the
system, do not disassemble it.  Also, erroneously installing the spacer retainer will significantly affect the rotational performance of
the system.  Do not disassemble the bearing.
 The matching mark of the inner or outer ring may be slightly misaligned when delivered.  In that case, loosen the bolts that secure
the inner or outer ring, and correct the alignment using a plastic hammer or the like, before installing it to the housing (let the
securing rivets follow the housing).
 When installing or removing the Cross-Roller Ring, do not apply force to the securing rivets or the bolts.
 When mounting the presser flange, take into account the dimensional tolerances of the parts so that the flange firmly holds the inner
and outer ring from the side.
 Dropping or hitting the Cross-Roller Ring may damage it.  Giving an impact to it could also cause damage to its function even if the
product looks intact.
 Lubrication
 Since each Cross-Roller Ring unit contains high-quality lithium soap group grease No. 2, you can start using the product without
replenishing grease.  However, the product requires regular lubrication since it has a smaller internal space than ordinary roller
bearings and because the rollers need frequent lubrication due to their rolling contact structure.
 To replenish grease, it is necessary to secure greasing holes that lead to the oil grooves formed on the inner and outer rings.  As for
the lubrication interval, normally replenish grease of the same group so that it is distributed throughout the interior of the bearing at
least every six to twelve months.  
 When the bearing is filled up with grease, the initial rotation torque temporarily increases.  However, surplus grease will run off of the
seals and the torque will return to the normal level in a short period.  The thin type does not have an oil groove.  Secure an oil
groove inside the housing for lubrication.
 Do not mix lubricants of different physical properties.
 In locations exposed to constant vibrations or in special environments such as clean rooms, vacuum and low/high temperature,
normal lubricants may not be used.  Contact THK for details.
 When planning to use a special lubricant, contact THK before using it.
 Precautions on Use
 Entrance of foreign matter may cause functional loss.  Prevent foreign matter, such as dust or cutting chips, from entering the
system.
 When desiring to use the system at temperature of 80℃or higher, contact THK in advance.
 If planning to use the Cross-Roller Ring in an environment where a coolant penetrates into the product, contact THK.
 If foreign matter adheres to the product, replenish the lubricant after cleaning the product with clean white kerosene.  
 When using the product in locations exposed to constant vibrations or in special environments such as clean rooms, vacuum and
low/high temperature, contact THK in advance.
