iSync Belts
ELATECH® iSync
iSync belts, are innovative truly
endless high performance power transmis-
sion belts with thermo set resin body and
steel (standard) or aramid fiber (on demand)
traction cords. The high modulus cords used
in the belt production, allow great length
stability and low bearing load.
The special manufacturing method and the
materials used, make ELATECH® iSync
iSync
belts extremely precise and therefore suita-
ble in all applications where high perfor-
mances are needed.
It makes drive calculations extremely quick
and reliable.
iSync belts
Features
• High power transmission capabilities
• Maintenance free
• Superior length stability
• Very high chemical resistance and particularly to oils, greases and gasoline
• Superior abrasion resistance
• High quality, thermo-set polyurethane designed specifically for timing belt applications
• Available with either steel or Kevlar® reinforcement
• Application temperature -30°C - +100 °C.
Applications
• Power transmission drives
- where high precision is needed
- where cleanliness is critical
- in difficult environment (presence of chemicals)
• Heavy duty conveying drives
- with special backing
- with cleats
Available profile range
ELATECH® iSync
iSync belts are available in a standard range in the following profile range:
• T2,5, T5, T10, AT5, AT10
The following profiles and executions are manufactured on request:
• MXL, HTD5M, DD (double sided)

T profile
ELA-flex SD ELA-flex SDTM  timing belts are manufactu-
red with truly endless high tensile steel
tension cords and high wear resistant
polyurethane body.
Having no splice or welding, the belts have
no weak cross section.
They are therefore ideal for power transmis-
sion applications and high load conveying
transmissions. 
The unique high tech manufacturing
process designed by our  technicians
allows the production of every belt length,
tooth by tooth from the minimum of 1500
mm to a maximum of 22000 mm to enable
the highest flexibility for the application.
Available also in double sided  
execution

special Belts
Elatech® EFT
EFT is ELATECH®'s mechanical profile application system
specially designed for attaching cleats that cannot be
welded onto polyurethane timing belts.
It is offered in zinc-coated or stainless steel teeth with
either our embedded tooth or total tooth design.  The total
tooth design replaces the entire tooth of the belt and has
two securing threaded holes.  The embedded tooth design
eliminates metal-to-metal contact, making this a more quiet
solution.
Elatech® EMF  
ELATECH® EMF - Mechanical Fastening System allows in
many conveying applications cost savings associated with
being able to design equipment around the installation
principle of EMF.

---

Rubber and Tecnogum
Several varieties of cleats can be attached on ELATECH®
polyurethane belts for conveying, handling and positioning
applications. Belts can be perforated, ground on tooth or
back side to optimize special applications.
Cleats and Mechanical machining
Many different rubber backings in both synthetic and natural
rubber are available. Due to the  high friction coefficient and
high temperature resistance of rubber, these backings are
used in many different conveying applications: paper
industry, ceramic industry, wood processing industry, glass
industry, labelling and packaging machines.
Polyurethane Foam
Polyurethane foams are easily compressible according to the
cellular structure of the material. Due to this property,
common applications are: labelling equipment, light and/or
fragile materials conveying, glass and paper industry,
vacuum conveyors.
Polyamide Fabric 
The special polyamide fabric backings allow a reduction of
the friction coefficient and when applied on teeth, decrease
noise in high speed drives. They are very useful in applications
with sliding surfaces or product accumulation.
Polyurethane Film  
Polyurethane films of different thickness and different shore
hardness, when applied on ELATECH® belts, are an ideal
solution in many conveying applications in the wood
processing, ceramic and glass industry. 
On request it is possible to supply FDA approved polyurethane
backings.
PVC 
PVC has a high coefficient of friction and provides good
resistance to acids. Due to its versatility, it is used in many
applications in the paper, glass, ceramic industry, labelling
and packing equipment. FDA quality material is suitable for
application in food industry processes.
