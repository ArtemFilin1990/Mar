SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE
TIMKEN
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS  
AND COMPONENTS
SHELF LIFE
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/
component design life as follows:
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation.
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity and 
extended storage.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
To help you get the most value from our products, Timken provides 
guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated ball and roller 
bearings, components and assemblies. Shelf life information is 
based on Timken and industry test data and experience.
European REACH compliance
Timken lubricants, greases and similar products sold in 
standalone containers or delivery systems are subject to the 
European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, 
please contact your Timken engineer.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for our 
ﬁnished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
referred to as “products”):
• Unless directed otherwise by Timken, products should be  
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be  
placed into service.
• Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on  
the packaging.
• Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
• After a product is removed from its packaging, it should  
be placed into service as soon as possible.
• When removing a product that is not individually packaged 
from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the product is removed. 
• The storage area temperature should be maintained 
between 0° C and 40° C; temperature ﬂuctuations should be 
minimized. 
• The relative humidity should be maintained below  
60 percent and the surfaces should be dry. 
• The storage area should be kept free from airborne 
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, harmful 
vapors, etc. 
• The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration. 
• Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Most bearing components typically ship protected with a 
corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant. These 
components may be used in oil-lubricated applications without 
removal of the corrosion-preventive compound. When using 
some specialized grease lubrications, we advise you to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before packing the bearing 
components with suitable grease. 
Be careful in selecting lubrication, however, since different 
lubricants are often incompatible. 
When you receive a bearing shipment, do not remove products 
from their packaging until they are ready for mounting so they 
do not become corroded or contaminated. 
Store bearings and bearing housings in an appropriate 
atmosphere so they remain protected for the intended period.

WARNINGS
TIMKEN
Failure to observe the following warnings  
could create a risk of death or serious injury.
Proper maintenance and handling practices are 
critical. Always follow installation instructions and 
maintain proper lubrication.
Tensile stresses can be very high in tightly ﬁtted 
bearing components. Attempting to remove such 
components by cutting the cone (inner race) may 
result in a sudden shattering of the component, 
causing fragments of metal to be forcefully expelled. 
Always use properly guarded presses or bearing 
pullers to remove bearings from shafts, and always 
use suitable personal protective equipment, 
including safety glasses.

Cages can impact several bearing operational characteristics such as:
• Maximum rotational speed
• Torque characteristics
• Temperature limits
• Lubricant ﬂow
There are a number of different cage types that are commonly used in deep groove 
ball bearings, the most popular being the riveted steel cage. Table 1 describes the most 
common cage types.

BEARING LUBRICATION
BEARING LUBRICATION
Bearings must be lubricated to minimize friction between balls 
and raceways, as well as between balls and cages. Lubricants 
also help to protect the bearings from corrosion and, in some 
cases, to dissipate heat.
Timken open ball bearings, as well as single-sealed/shielded 
bearings, are supplied with rust preventive (RP) covering all 
bearing surfaces. For such bearings, the end user selects and 
applies the desired lubrication type and quantity as required by 
the application.
Timken double-sealed and double-shielded deep groove ball 
bearings are factory pre-lubricated with water-resistant grease 
chosen for chemical and mechanical stability. The standard 
grease preferred by Timken for deep groove ball bearings 
is Mobil Polyrex EM. This is a mineral-oil based, advanced 
polyurea-thickened grease that maintains proper lubrication 
for a wide range of operating temperatures from -29° C to

motor applications.
The standard factory grease ﬁll is 30 to 50 percent for most Timken 
double-sealed/shielded ball bearings. This accommodates most 
applications. The type and amount of grease needed varies 
depending on operating conditions and bearing series. Most 
bearings can be ﬁlled with customer-speciﬁed greases upon 
request to meet speciﬁc application needs. Aside from Mobil 
Polyrex EM grease, Timken also offers a range of other proven 
and popular greases suitable for a wide range of applications.

10  TIMKEN® DEEP GROOVE BALL BEARING CATALOG
BEARING LIFE
BEARING LIFE
The selection of the appropriate bearing for a given application 
is dependent on several performance criteria. These include 
bearing fatigue life, rotating precision, power requirement, 
temperature limits, speed capabilities and sound requirements. 
This section deals primarily with bearing life as related to 
material-associated fatigue.
Bearing life is defined as the length of time, or number of 
revolutions, until a fatigue spall of 6 mm2 develops. Since fatigue 
is a statistical phenomenon, the life of an individual bearing 
is impossible to predetermine precisely. Bearings that may 
appear to be identical can exhibit considerable life scatter when 
tested under identical conditions. Thus, it is necessary to base 
life predictions on a statistical evaluation of a large number 
of bearings operating under similar conditions. The Weibull 
distribution function is the accepted standard for predicting the 
life of a population of bearings at any given reliability level.
RATING LIFE
Rating life (L10) is the life that 90 percent of a group of apparently 
identical bearings will complete or exceed before a fatigue spall 
develops. The L10 life also is associated with 90 percent reliability 
for a single bearing under a certain load.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Published dynamic load ratings for deep groove ball bearings 
are based on the industry standard procedure outlined in ISO 
281:2007. This rating, designated as Cr, is deﬁned as the radial 
load under which a population of bearings will achieve a L10 life 
of one million revolutions. Radial load is assumed to be constant 
in magnitude and direction for radial ball bearings.
STATIC LOAD RATING
The basic static load rating for Timken bearings (designated as 
C0r) as deﬁned in ISO 76:2006 is based on a maximum contact 
stress within a non-rotating bearing of 4200 MPa at the center 
of the most heavily loaded rolling element and raceway contact. 
Such stress levels may cause visible light Brinell marks 
on the bearing raceways. This degree of marking will not 
have a measurable effect on fatigue life when the bearing is 
subsequently rotated under a lower application load. If sound, 
vibration or torque are critical or if a pronounced shock load is 
present, a lower load limit should be applied. For more information 
on selecting a bearing for static load conditions, consult your 
Timken sales engineer. 
SPEED RATING
THERMAL REFERENCE SPEED
The thermal reference speed is the bearing thermal equilibrium 
speed based on industry standard reference conditions outlined in 
ISO 15312: 2003. Thermal equilibrium balances the heat generated 
by the bearing, with heat conduction through the housing and 
shaft. This standard applies to both bath oil lubricated and 30 
percent grease ﬁll packed bearings. It excludes any heat removed 
by a circulating lubricant. This standard also excludes the outer 
ring rotating application and heat generated by contact seals.
The ISO 15312 thermal reference speed rating calculations are 
based on the following assumptions:
• The bearing ambient temperature is 20° C.
• The tolerable bearing/housing interface temperature is 70° C.
• Oil and grease lubricants are considered.
• For radial bearings with oil lubrication: ISO VG 32 oil.
• For radial bearings with grease lubrication:  
ISO VG 150 grease.
• The radial loads assume a normal clearance (C0 or CN).
• For radial bearings, the applied load is 5 percent of the 
static load rating (C0r). 
Thermal reference speed ratings assume the bearing has been 
sufﬁciently broken in. During the break-in process, temperatures 
may exceed the tolerable limit. Break-in commonly takes between 
10 to 36 hours.
Standard bearing materials and lubricants can generally 
withstand temperatures up to and beyond 100° C. For this reason, 
a permissible temperature of 100° C was assumed for the thermal 
speed rating calculation. Contact your Timken sales engineer if your 
application requires speeds above the Timken published values. 
LIMITING SPEED
For certain ball bearing types and sizes, cage behavior becomes 
the limiting factor to bearing operating speed. For such bearings, 
the thermal speed rating per ISO 15312:2003 is not shown. Instead, 
Timken publishes limiting speeds for those bearings, as is the 
case for thin-section and extra-small deep groove ball bearings. 
For bearings with contact seals, the speed rating also is impacted 
by the speed of the seal. In general, bearings with contact seals 
have speed ratings that are 50 percent to 60 percent of the 
published speed rating of the equivalent open bearing.

RADIAL INTERNAL CLEARANCE
RADIAL INTERNAL CLEARANCE
In the manufacturing of deep groove ball bearings, it is standard 
practice to assemble rings and rolling elements with a speciﬁed 
internal clearance. This characteristic is necessary to absorb 
the loss of clearance due to press ﬁtting the bearing rings at 
mounting or due to expansion of bearings, shafts and housings. 
Internal clearance in an application is an important factor that 
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on bearing performance.
The radial internal clearance (RIC) in a deep groove ball bearing 
can be deﬁned as the average outer-ring raceway diameter 
minus the average inner-ring raceway diameter minus twice 
the ball diameter. 
Internal clearance reduces due to press ﬁtting the bearing rings 
on the shaft or in the housing. This reduced internal clearance 
in the bearings at mounted condition is called mounted radial 
internal clearance.

BEARING TOLERANCES
BEARING TOLERANCES
Ball bearings are manufactured to a number of speciﬁcations, 
with each having classes that deﬁne tolerances on dimensions 
such as bore, outer diameter, width and runout.
Standard Timken deep groove ball bearings maintain normal 
tolerances (P0) according to the current ISO 492 standard. 
For applications where running tolerance is critical, P6 or P5 
tolerances are recommended.

The term “deviation” is deﬁned as the difference between a single 
ring dimension and the nominal dimension. For metric tolerances, 
the normal dimension is at a +0 mm tolerance. The deviation is 
the tolerance range for the listed parameter. Variation is deﬁned 
as the difference between the largest and smallest measurement 
of a given parameter for an individual ring.
Tables 6 and 7 provide tolerances for deep groove ball bearing 
inner and outer rings respectively.

FITTING PRACTICE 
FITTING PRACTICE 
As a general guideline, bearing rings mounted on a rotating 
member should have an interference ﬁt. Loose ﬁts may permit the 
ring to creep or turn, and wear the mating surface and backing 
shoulder. This wear can result in excessive bearing looseness 
and damage the bearing, shaft or housing.
The choice of ﬁtting practices will mainly depend upon the 
following parameters:
• Precision class of the bearing.
• Rotating or stationary ring.
• Type of layout (single- or double-row bearings).
• Type and direction of load (continuous/alternate rotating).
• Particular running conditions like shocks, vibrations,  
over-loading or high speed.
• Capability for machining the bearing seats (grinding,  
turning or boring). 
• Shaft and housing section and material.
• Mounting and setting conditions.
Fig. 2 is a graphical representation of bearing shaft and housing 
ﬁt selection that conforms to accepted industry standards 
and practices. The bars designated g6, h6, etc., represent 
shaft/housing diameter and tolerance ranges to achieve various 
loose and interference ﬁts required for various load and ring 
rotation conditions.
Tables 8 and 9, on the following pages, provide the resultant ﬁts 
based on standard ISO tolerances for shaft and housing.
