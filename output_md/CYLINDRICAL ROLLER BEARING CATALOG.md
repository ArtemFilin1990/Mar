SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
INTRODUCTION
A
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED 
BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
Timken guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated rolling bearings, components and 
assemblies are set forth below. Shelf life information is based on test data and experience. 
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/ component design life as follows:
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
EUROPEAN REACH COMPLIANCE
Timken-branded lubricants, greases and similar products sold 
in stand-alone containers or delivery systems are subject to 
the European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, 
please contact your Timken engineer.
SHELF LIFE POLICY
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation. 
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity 
and extended storage.
Shelf life values, available from Timken, represent a maximum 
limit – and assume adherence to the Timken suggested 
storage and handling guidelines. Deviations from Timken 
storage and handling guidelines may reduce shelf life. Any 
speciﬁ cation or operating practice that deﬁ nes a shorter shelf 
life should be used. Timken cannot anticipate the performance 
of the grease lubricant after the bearing or component is 
installed or placed in service.

 • The storage area should be kept free from airborne 
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, 
harmful vapors, etc.
 • The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration.
 • Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Upon receipt of a bearing shipment, ensure that the bearings 
are not removed from their packaging until they are ready 
for mounting so that they do not become corroded or 
contaminated. Bearings should be stored in an appropriate 
atmosphere in order that they remain protected for the 
intended period.
Any questions concerning shelf life or storage should be 
directed to your local sales ofﬁ ce.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for its 
ﬁ nished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
hereinafter referred to as “Products”):
 •  Unless directed otherwise by Timken, Products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 • Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on the 
packaging.
 • Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 • After a Product is removed from its packaging, it should be 
placed into service as soon as possible.
 • When removing a Product that is not individually pack-
aged from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the Product is removed.
 • Do not use Product that has exceeded its shelf life as 
deﬁ ned in Timken’s shelf life guidelines statement.
 • The storage area temperature should be maintained 
between 0º C (32º F) and 40º C (104º F); temperature 
ﬂ uctuations should be minimized.
 • The relative humidity should be maintained below 
60 percent and the surfaces should be dry.

BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
TIMKEN
® BEARINGS
Timken provides an extensive variety of rolling bearing types 
and sizes. Knowing that the bearing is often the most critical 
component within a moving assembly, Timken engineers take 
great care to ensure the customer is receiving maximum value 
when a Timken® bearing is selected. Timken provides the proper 
bearing for virtually any motion-control application. With more 
than a century of proven experience in bearing technology, 
Timken is a world leader in the rolling bearing industry.
The Timken Company has an experienced, highly skilled staff 
of trained engineers located around the world to assist the 
customer in bringing new, mechanized products to market. Timken 
engineers are a powerful resource for customers to turn to for 
assistance in the appropriate selection of bearings to meet any 
of the following considerations:
 • Higher technical demands or higher levels of application 
requirements.
 • Higher levels of application complexity.
 • Critical applications where system damage must be avoided 
for all modes of operation.
 • Potential exposure to personal injury.
 • Costly damage or downtime resulting from the use of an 
inappropriate bearing for a given task.
Because Timken offers so many bearing conﬁ gurations to serve 
a wide variety of situations, a suggested starting point in the 
selection process focuses on the assessment of two basic 
categories: the ﬁ rst being boundary (or ﬁ xed) conditions and 
the second being performance expectations (or desired results). 
Depending on your application, the boundary conditions and 
performance expectations will vary. Trade-offs or compromises 
must be addressed so that the ﬁ nal bearing type and size selected 
are a reasonable balance of all factors. It is a wise practice to 
examine factors critical to the success of the device and prioritize 
them. 
Boundary (or fixed) conditions that should be taken into
consideration include:
 • External loads, including radial, thrust, moment, shock and 
combination loads.
 • Acceleration and deceleration levels.
 • Operating temperature range (including extreme limits and 
thermal cycling).
 • Other environmental factors, such as humidity, ﬂ uids, 
vibration, debris, magnetic ﬁ elds and vacuum.
 • Spatial constraints.
Performance expectations (or desired results) to consider include:
 • Rotational accuracy and repeatability (e.g., service 
precision level).
 • System rigidity (axial or radial stiffness).
 • Application service life.
 • Speed.
Looking at the key operating parameters of the system will help 
focus on the most viable bearing solution. 
Typical considerations in application design include optimization 
of controllable variables affecting application performance:
 • Bearing design. 
 • Bearing shaft and housing arrangement; shaft and housing 
material. 
 • Installation and handling requirements of the bearing, as 
well as shaft and housing preparation. 
 • Presence of adequate sealing for the exclusion of contami-
nants; types of foreign materials possible. 
 • Lubricating method (lubrication type and delivery system).
 • Maintenance procedures and intervals.
Once these conditions and expectations are identified and 
prioritized, the most appropriate bearing type(s), size(s), and 
part number(s) that meet the basic application requirements 
can be selected.

CATALOG PRODUCT SELECTION
ENGINEERING
CATALOG PRODUCT SELECTION
Timken produces precision bearings and assemblies in miniature and thin-section series. The 
bearings are manufactured with quality steel, tolerances and features that meet demanding 
application challenges. These precision bearings and assemblies are found in surgical and 
diagnostic imaging devices, precision pumps, measurement and material handling equipment, 
as well as guidance, weapons and space applications. Standard sizes range from 0.025 in. to 11 
in. bore (1 mm to 280 mm bore).
Typical applications use preloaded pairs for maximum stiffness, 
high speeds and precise positioning. These include surgical 
handpieces, control-moment gyros and other high-speed or 
high-stiffness applications. Available as a single bearing or 
preloaded duplex pair.
FRACTURED-RACE 
BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.3750 in. - 3.0625 in.
These bearings have outer rings that 
are radially fractured in one location. 
This permits the race to be opened 
for complete ﬂ exibility in the choice 
of ball complement and separator 
in a deep-groove radial bearing.
High-strength stainless-steel holding bands are pressed on the 
ground shoulders to maintain tight abutment and alignment of the 
fractured surface during handling. Full complement and several 
retainer options are available. 
Typical applications have a limited radial cross section and a 
limited axial width. These applications require a bearing with 
maximum radial capacity, as well as some axial capacity in both 
directions. Contact Timken engineering for more information.

RADIAL BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0250 in. - 11.0000 in.
These deep-groove (Conrad) bearings
allow for handling of radial, thrust in two 
directions, or combination of loads. The 
deep-groove bearings are produced 
to ABEC 5 - ABEC 7 precision levels as 
standard catalog offering. These are 
offered primarily with 440C stainless-
steel rings and balls with a variety of separator types. In 
addition, other material options are available, as well as 
shields and seals, and ceramic or titanium carbide-coated 
balls. Radial ball bearings are the only bearings offered as 
a standard with two seals or shields. Flanges are offered 
on miniature product. Typical applications include guidance 
systems, medical (surgical instruments and devices) and robotic 
joints. Available as a single bearing or preloaded duplex pair.
ANGULAR-CONTACT 
BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0250 in. - 11.0000 in.
Angular-contact ball bearings offer 
maximum ball complement for 
additional load capacity and axial 
stiffness. These angular-contact 
bearings allow for handling of radial,
thrust in one direction, or a combination 
of loading. The one-piece precision
machined retainer provides higher speed capability. Angular-
contact bearings are manufactured to the same tolerances 
and standards as the radial ball bearings. Rings and balls are 
normally 440C stainless steel, but other material options are 
offered. Steel and ceramic balls are available as standard.

SPECIAL PRODUCTS
INTEGRAL ASSEMBLIES
Timken designs and produces specialized integral assemblies. 
These assemblies utilize precision bearings that are mated 
with components manufactured to extremely tight tolerances 
or contain bearing raceways integrated into the shaft and/or 
housing. By avoiding tolerance stack-ups, integral assemblies 
provide the ultimate bearing solution for critical applications 
requiring precise positional control and low radial/axial runout. 
Integral designs have the added beneﬁ ts of mounting ease and 
more value to the user.
X-RAY
This bearing assembly supports the rotating anode in an X-ray-
generating vacuum tube. To meet the severe operating conditions 
of 10-8 TORR vacuum, 752° F - 932° F (400° C - 500° C) and 10,000 
RPM, super high-speed steel alloys, such as M62, are required 
for bearing rings and balls. The integral shaft raceway design 
offers cost and performance advantages.   
DOUBLE-ROW AND SUPER DUPLEX BEARINGS
When two radial ball-bearing raceways are ground wider than 
standard width inner and outer rings, a double-row ball bearing 
is created.  A double-row bearing has a single piece inner ring 
and a single piece outer ring for ease of handling. Double-row 
bearings are normally supplied to an axial play speciﬁ cation 
or a radial play speciﬁ cation, and also can incorporate special 
features such as slots, ﬂ anges and holes if required.
Super duplex bearings are a special version of a double-row 
bearing, where only one ring has two raceways ground into it. 
Super duplex bearings are typically manufactured as angular- 
contact ball bearings, and can be supplied as a DB (back-to-back) 
or a DF (face-to-face) super duplex assembly.  A DB super duplex 
bearing utilizes a single outer ring with two angular-contact 
raceways, and two precisely matched inner rings to provide for 
the desired preload.  
Fig. 5. Thrust ball bearing. 
PIVOT BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0600 in. - 0.3750 in.   
Designed for space-constrained environments where low torque 
is required, pivot bearings use the mating shaft for the inner 
raceway. These bearings achieve maximum power density with a 
full complement of larger balls, no separator or inner ring. Shields 
are available for the standard line. Typical applications are in 
guidance systems, such as commercial gyroscopes. 
THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Size Range:
0.0937 in. - 0.1250 in.
These bearings are designed for applications where there is high-
axial loading, low speeds and relatively high-allowable torque. 
The standard offering has all stainless-steel components for use 
where inert materials are required. Typical applications include 
fuel control systems.

A DF super duplex bearing utilizes a single inner ring with two 
angular-contact raceways, and two precisely matched outer 
rings to provide for the desired preload. Super duplex bearings 
can be supplied with customized radial play or contact angle to 
meet speciﬁ c application conditions, and also can incorporate 
special features such as slots, ﬂ anges and holes if required. 
Double-row or super duplex bearings can be supplied as a 
cartridge bearing design. Timken uses the term cartridge bearing 
to denote the addition of inner- and outer-ring spacers, which 
results in an overall bearing assembly that is wider than two 
single-row bearings. Additional material can be added to the 
design at the bearing inner diameter (I.D.) or the bearing outer 
diameter (O.D.), resulting in thicker bearing ring cross sections 
for those applications that require a different ring thickness to 
meet special design requirements.
Integrating spacers or additional I.D. or O.D. material can offer 
distinct advantages over an assembly composed of discrete 
components (such as bearings plus spacers plus sleeves).  Some 
design advantages include lower, more consistent torque, more 
consistent preload, improved running accuracy, and simpliﬁ ed 
installation.  As with super duplex assemblies, cartridge bearings 
can be supplied with any desired preload, with customized radial 
play or contact angle to meet speciﬁ c application conditions, 
and they also can incorporate special features such as slots, 
ﬂ anges and holes.     
GIMBAL ASSEMBLIES
Precision grinding, machining and assembly capabilities along 
with the latest in bearing technology are combined to produce 
gimbal assemblies. Participation in design, prototype and 
production efforts enables Timken to supply hardware at all 
levels including bearings, component parts, subassemblies and 
assemblies. These mechanical assemblies are routinely built 
with gimbal axis and spin axis intersection tolerances of less 
than 0.0002 in. and in some instances include optical components. 
HYBRID BEARINGS
In applications where marginal lubrication, high speed and heat 
are factors, Timken hybrid bearings may perform signiﬁ cantly 
better than all steel bearings. Ceramic or coated rolling elements 
can reduce wear of the raceway in marginally lubricated 
contacts. In high-speed applications, the lower density of silicon 
nitride reduces centrifugal forces of the balls on the outer race. 
Timken bearings may be ordered with either Silicon Nitride balls 
or Titanium-Carbide-coated steel balls in combination with 440C 
or 52100 steel rings. Hybrid bearings are currently used in many 
applications including gyro spin and gimbal applications, aircraft 
accessory and dental handpieces.
FOUR-POINT CONTACT (GOTHIC ARCH)
BEARINGS
The four-point contact bearing (raceway) consists of two true 
radius arcs with equally offset centers from the race centerline. 
With this construction, a single four-point contact ball bearing 
performs in many ways as if it were two bearings combined into 
one. By creating an X pattern of ball contact, a single bearing 
can deﬁ ne both radial and axial shaft location. Four-point contact 
bearings are attractive options on a variety of applications where 
space is limited and it is desirable to control axial play, resist 
overturning moments, or contain thrust in two directions. Among 
the mechanisms that commonly use this bearing are rotary tables, 
radar systems and material handling robots.

MPS 160 multiplying encoder ASIC   
The MPS 160, or advanced multiplying encoder ASIC, offers 
design engineers an alternative to delicate optical sensors 
and expensive resolvers. The fully integrated Timken design 
features on-chip Hall sensors and processing that provide 
optical encoder resolutions in a small, durable, low-cost, off-axis 
magnetic encoder package. The MPS 160 combines a direction-
sensing Hall Effect encoder with integrated index pulses and a 
high-accuracy resolution multiplying circuit. The result is a 
high-resolution speed and position sensor system on a chip that is 
mounted off-axis to the shaft. The ASIC produces and processes 
Hall Effect signals to create high-resolution quadrature output 
signals, providing zero speed and direction sensing. When used 
with special magnetized targets, digital index signals are output 
by the chip and synchronized with the high-resolution circuit 
signal. 
Standard and special encoder kit designs are available with the 
MPS160.

MATERIALS
Material selection is a critical consideration in ball bearing 
design. The interaction of the balls, races, retainer and lubricant 
with each other and the environment is usually the limiting factor 
in the overall performance of the bearing. Timken’s extensive 
experience in the development and manufacture of ball bearings 
and bearing assemblies is a valuable resource for proper material 
selection. 
Every component and raw material purchased by Timken is 
controlled by a material speciﬁ cation which meets or exceeds 
industry, government and customer specifications. Each 
lot of material is certiﬁ ed and checked against the material 
speciﬁ cation prior to being released to production. Bearing 
material requirements include hardness, grain size, chemical 
analysis and carbide and inclusion ratings. Bearing rings 
and rolling elements are checked in-process for hardness, 
dimensional stability and, if applicable, corrosion resistance. 
Timken maintains an advanced heat-treat department utilizing 
vacuum furnaces and other special equipment. Vacuum 
hardening allows Timken to meet the strictest military and 
commercial requirements for product uniformity. Timken is 
NADCAP approved for heat-treat processes, as well as non-
destructive testing and chemical processing. 
RING AND BALL MATERIALS
Available ring and ball materials are summarized in table 1 on 
page 16.
440C STAINLESS STEEL 
440C stainless steel is a martensitic high-carbon steel with 
up to 18 percent chromium, providing both the high hardness 
needed for bearing applications and atmospheric corrosion 
resistance. With standard heat treatment, bearings of 440C 
have a minimum hardness of HRC 58 and can be operated at 
temperatures of 250˚ F (121˚ C). Rings and balls are capable of 
meeting the dimensional stability requirements of MIL-B-81793, 
which specifies maximum dimensional size change over 
the temperature range of -80˚ F to +302˚ F (-62˚ C to +150˚ C). 
With special heat treatment, operating temperatures of 500˚ F
(260˚ C) may be tolerated.
Timken uses the 440C steel made either by air melting, by 
the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process, or by consumable 
electrode vacuum-arc remelting (CEVM). All 440C is  made to the 
strictest limits of cleanliness and uniformity. These requirements, 
especially of micro-cleanliness and carbide structure, have 
resulted in improved raceway ﬁ nishes.
52100 CHROMIUM STEEL 
52100 high-carbon steel is a 1 ½ percent chromium steel and is 
used for a variety of bearing applications such as gyroscope 
spin-axis bearings where higher hardness and better surface 
ﬁ nish are required. 52100 steel has a slightly higher minimum 
hardness than 440C at HRC 60 and greater wear resistance. It is 
sometimes chosen for instrument bearing applications because 
of its extraordinarily uniform microstructure. The standard 
heat treatment will be suitable for service at temperatures as 
high as 250˚ F (121˚ C).  Rings and balls are capable of meeting 
the dimensional stability requirements of MIL-B-81793, which 
speciﬁ es maximum dimensional size change over the temperature 
range of -80˚ F to +302˚ F (-62˚ C to +150˚ C). Special heat treatments 
can be provided for higher operating temperatures.  
The SAE-52100 Timken uses is made by either air melting 
followed by vacuum degassing or by double vacuum melting 
(VIM-VAR). Both of these processes provide material of high 
micro-cleanliness.
RING MARKING FOR MATERIAL 
IDENTIFICATION
For bearings with outside dimensions less than 1.18 in., certain 
radial lines on one bearing face indicate that the bearing was

NON-STANDARD MATERIALS 
AMS 5749 
AMS 5749(1) high-performance bearing steel is a martensitic 
high-speed stainless steel that combines the hot hardness 
characteristic of M50 with the corrosion and oxidation resistance 
of 440C. This material is suited to hot air valve bearings, but solves 
many other application problems as well.
AMS 5749 has excellent wear resistance, can operate at 
temperatures as high as 600˚ F (316˚ C) and has corrosion 
resistance superior to M50. The AMS 5749 material used at Timken 
is made by vacuum-induction melting followed by vacuum-arc 
remelting (VIM/VAR). This process achieves the highest degree 
of cleanliness and uniformity of structure for this material.
M50 
M50 high-speed steel is a high-performance tool steel containing 
molybdenum, chromium and vanadium. This material is suited to 
main shaft bearings in gas turbine engines, however, it solves 
many other application problems as well. M50 has greater 
wear resistance than both 440C and 52100 and can operate at 
temperatures as high as 600˚ F (316˚ C). All M50 used at Timken 
is made by vacuum-induction melting followed by vacuum-arc 
remelting (VIM/VAR). This process achieves the highest degree 
of cleanliness and uniformity of structure for this material.
M62 
M62 super-high-performance tool steel is a high-alloyed steel 
with very high hardness, excellent wear resistance and superior 
hot hardness. M62 is used in severe service applications 
with temperatures up to 1000˚ F (538˚ C). In addition, M62 has 
demonstrated 10 times the fatigue life compared to standard 
bearing steels. 
Beryllium copper 
Beryllium copper is a precipitation hardening alloy of 2 percent 
beryllium in copper used in applications where non-magnetic 
and electrical conductivity properties are required. It has far less 
hardness (HRC 38 minimum), wear resistance and strength than 
conventional bearing materials, resulting in lower load ratings.
Hybrid bearings 
Hybrid bearings may perform signiﬁ cantly better than an all-steel 
bearing in applications where marginal lubrication, high speed 
and high heat are factors. Silicon nitride and titanium carbide 
hybrid bearings are currently used in many applications including 
gimbal, gyro spin, aircraft accessory and dental handpieces. 
When the internal ball and raceway surfaces of a ball bearing are 
not separated by a sufﬁ cient oil ﬁ lm thickness, the surface ﬁ nish 
high points (known as asperities) can contact each other. When 
the balls and races are made of the same material, the asperities 
can weld together under the very high localized contact stresses 
that occur, resulting in surface damage, particle generation, and 
ultimately shortened bearing service life. For unlubricated or 
marginally lubricated applications, ceramic balls eliminate ball-
to-race asperity welding, and the resulting negative effects on 
bearing service life. Titanium carbide coated stainless-steel balls 
offer the same beneﬁ ts, but are suggested for use in marginally 
lubricated applications only. Contact your Timken engineer to 
determine the suggested solution for your application.  
In high-speed applications the lower density of silicon nitride 
signiﬁ cantly reduces the centrifugal forces of the balls on the 
outer race.  Bearings with silicon nitride balls also operate cooler 
and exhibit less vibration.   
Most Timken bearings may be ordered with silicon nitride or 
titanium carbide coated balls in combination with 440C and 52100 
steel rings.
Nickel-cobalt alloys 
Nickel-cobalt alloys are used in bearings developed by Timken for 
applications requiring non-magnetic and noncorrosive materials 
with greater load capacity than beryllium copper bearings. While 
not commonly used, these materials can be used in applications 
such as medical components, seawater, chemical and food 
processing environments. Because these materials cannot be 
hardened past HRC 40, they yield bearings with relatively low 
static capacities, and so their application needs to be considered 
very carefully.
Full ceramic bearings 
Full ceramic bearings can be developed for applications requiring 
high hardness, light weight, high temperature and corrosion 
resistance. Limited sizes are available. Consult your engineer 
for availability.

The correct choice of retainer for a precision ball bearing is often 
critical to ensuring bearing performance sufﬁ cient for application 
requirements. 

Aside from its obvious function as a ball separator, the retainer 
makes a vital contribution to overall bearing performance and 
helps determine a bearing’s:  

 • Maximum rotational speed (dN). 

 • Torque characteristics.  

 • Temperature limits.
 • Lubricant system.

SHIELDS AND SEALS
ENGINEERING
Clearance
Integral shield
Fig. 14. Standard shield 
and seal conﬁ gurations.
SHIELDS AND SEALS
Some applications may not allow the use of open bearings. Shields or seals may be used to protect 
against contamination and help retain lubricant.
SEALS
In debris-heavy applications, seals provide extra contamination 
protection at the sacriﬁ ce of the lowest possible frictional torque 
levels.
Timken miniature and instrument series bearings use a thin ﬂ uoro-
polymer impregnated glass cloth washer held in the outer ring by 
snap wires. The seal contacts a smooth shoulder on the inner ring.
The standard seal design for Timken thin-section series bearings 
is similar to the shield except that the bore of the rubber molding 
is controlled to maintain positive contact with the inner ring.
In addition to the standard shields and seals, special designs have 
been developed by Timken for demanding applications where a 
standard conﬁ guration would not sufﬁ ce. Consult your Timken 
engineer for more information on special closure designs.
SEAL ADVANTAGES
 • Contact with inner ring prevents small and large particulate 
from entering bearing. 
 • Greatly improves lubricant retention in bearing.
 • Acts as a pressure or ﬂ ow barrier.
SEAL DISADVANTAGES
 • Increases bearing torque.
 • Limits bearing speed due to inner ring contact.

SHIELDS
Timken miniature and instrument series bearings use precision 
300 series stainless-steel shields held in the outer ring by snap 
wires. These shields are accurately positioned in the outer ring 
to maintain a close clearance with the outer diameter of the 
inner ring.
Timken thin-section series bearings use a shield that incorporates 
a stainless-steel insert which has Nitrile rubber bonded to it. The 
shield is held securely in place by compression of the rubber 
around the outside diameter of the insert. The shield bore is held 
concentric to the outside diameter of the inner ring with tight 
tolerances to maintain close running clearance. Shields made 
from Nitrile rubber can be used to 275° F (135° C). For higher 
temperature applications special ﬂ uorocarbon or stainless-steel 
shields can be used.
Fractured race thin-section bearings cannot use standard shields 
due to the thin cross sectional area between the shield recess 
and holding wire shoulder grooves. This bearing type is available 
with integral shields machined as part of the inner ring. 
SHIELD ADVANTAGES
 • Non-contacting with inner ring will not affect torque.
 • Prevents large particles (over 0.005 in.) from entering 
bearing.
 • Improves lubrication retention in bearing.
SHIELD DISADVANTAGES
 • Does not provide positive sealing against ﬁ ne 
contamination (under 0.005 in.).

20  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
TOLERANCES
Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings are 
manufactured in accordance with tolerance classes speciﬁ ed 
by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the 
American Bearing Manufacturer’s Association (ABMA). ANSI/
ABMA Standard 12 covers miniature and instrument bearings 
and Standard 26 covers thin-section bearings.
Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings are 
manufactured in precision classes from ABEC 3 (lowest) to ABEC 
9 (highest) with the most common being ABEC 5 or 7. Please note 
the ANSI/ABMA does not deﬁ ne an ABEC 9 class for thin-section 
bearings. For applications that require a special tolerance not 
covered by any of these precision classes, please contact your 
Timken engineer.
The tables that follow compare the tolerance features of the 
various ABEC classes for miniature, instrument and thin-section 
bearings. These tolerances relate to external dimensions 
as well as the geometric relationship of the ball groove with 
bearing mounting surfaces. These individual tolerance values 
provide a guide to the bearing user in designing his shaft and 
housings, since surfaces to which bearings are mounted should 
have tolerance levels equivalent to those on the corresponding 
bearing surface.
Please note that the 610 and 812 bearings have tolerances 
controlled by the miniature and instrument bearing speciﬁ cation 
(Standard 12), even though they are dimensionally classiﬁ ed as 
thin-section parts.

Both the internal clearance and raceway geometry of a bearing 
have a signiﬁ cant impact on performance.  
CONTACT ANGLE
The contact angle of a bearing is the angle between a line through 
the ball center perpendicular to the bearing axis and a line through 
the two points where the ball contacts the races when the bearing 
axial play is removed.
Fig. 15. Contact angle.
The contact angle of a bearing establishes the bearing’s relative 
axial and radial capability.  
Generally, increasing the contact angle increases axial load 
capacity, axial stiffness and moment stiffness, but at the expense 
of radial load capacity and radial stiffness. Decreasing the 
contact angle has the opposite effect.  There is a geometric limit 
to increasing contact angle. Too great a contact angle increase 
results in the ball/raceway contact path reaching the edge of the 
raceway, which is called truncation.  
The contact angle is commonly referred to in two conditions – free 
contact angle and loaded contact angle.
Free contact angle is the contact angle of a bearing with its axial 
play removed but without any axial loads applied. 
Free contact angle is geometrically related to the bearing 
raceway curvature and radial play. 
With all other parameters ﬁ xed, increasing radial play increases 
free contact angle.  
Loaded contact angle is the contact angle of a bearing under an 
applied axial load. The loaded contact angle is the free contact 
angle plus the increase due to the applied axial load.
RACEWAY CURVATURE
Raceway curvature is deﬁ ned as the ratio of raceway radius 
to ball diameter. Raceway curvature impacts many aspects of 
bearing performance including:
 • Load capacity.
 • Internal friction.
 • Radial play to axial play relationship.
 • Radial play to contact angle relationship.
Timken has selected the raceway curvatures for its standard 
product to provide the appropriate performance balance for the 
typical miniature and instrument bearing applications.  
RADIAL PLAY
Radial play, also known as radial internal clearance or diametral 
clearance, is the total range of movement in the radial direction 
that one ring can have relative to the other.  

Fig. 16. Radial play.
Proper selection of radial play is essential for performance of a 
bearing. Radial play impacts the following aspects of a bearing:
 • Contact angle.
 • Axial play. 
 • Axial and radial capacity.
It is important to realize that the radial play of the bearing can be 
reduced by a number of application conditions including:
 • Interference ﬁ ts at installation.
 • Interference ﬁ t changes due to temperature changes.
 • Temperature gradients across the bearing.
 • Centrifugal forces during operation.

Proper consideration of the radial play change due to these 
operating conditions is critical. Care must be taken to ensure that 
there is sufﬁ cient internal clearance in the bearing to prevent 
complete loss of radial play from the application conditions. 
Complete loss of radial play results in signiﬁ cant increases in 
friction and heat. It can result in premature bearing damage. 
Timken is able to build product to either contact angle or radial 
play but our standard product is built to the parameter deﬁ ned 
in the table below unless otherwise requested.

AXIAL PLAY
Axial play, also known as endplay, is the total range of pure axial 
movement that that one ring can have relative to the other.
Fig. 17. Axial play.
Axial play is a function of the radial play of the bearing and its 
ball and raceway geometry. It is not typically used to specify a 
bearing’s internal clearance since radial play or contact angle 
are the primary parameters used to specify bearing internal 
clearance.   
Control of axial play in an application can be achieved through 
changes in internal geometry of a single bearing or more 
commonly by incorporating an additional bearing. The bearing 
pair can either be conﬁ gured to have reduced shared axial play or 
it can be preloaded with no axial play. This is commonly achieved 
by accurately controlling the axial separation between the outer 
and inner ring pairs through spacers or shimming.

LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
ENGINEERING
28  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE 
AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
Lubrication selection and application has a signiﬁ cant impact 
on the performance and operational life of a ball bearing. The 
lubrication of a bearing does the following:
 • Reduce friction and wear of contacting surfaces. 
 • Protect surfaces from oxidation/corrosion. 
Other aspects of bearing performance impacted by lubrication are:
 • Operating temperature management.
 • Contamination management.
REDUCE FRICTION AND WEAR
A lubricant may be seen as a separating layer between two 
sliding surfaces. Its purpose is to inhibit surface wear while 
maintaining the lowest possible friction torque level. The ball and 
raceway surfaces, although precision honed and lapped, appear 
microscopically as a pattern of peaks and valleys. When rubbed 
together under the high unit loading inherent in point contact, 
these asperities are thought to weld together, then break off, 
initiating an adhesive wear process which ultimately damages 
the bearing. Adhesive wear is inhibited by:
 • Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁ lm. 
 • Boundary lubrication. 
 • Mixed-ﬁ lm lubrication. 
EHD FILMS
EHD ﬁ lms are generated dynamically in a rotating bearing and 
are a function of the bearing’s speed, operating load and the 
lubricant’s viscosity in the contact area. Lubricant viscosity 
typically increases when subject to pressure but decreases at 
elevated temperatures so the lubricant viscosity in the contact 
area is a function of the lubricant properties, bearing speed, 
operating load and operating temperatures. Rolling element-to-
race contacts can be effectively separated by the high lubricant 
viscosities generated under the typical surface contact pressures 
which are in the hundreds of thousands of pounds per square 
inch. Once separated by a distance greater than the combined 
asperity height, the surfaces will not contact and adhesive wear 
will be eliminated.
BOUNDARY LUBRICATING FILMS 
Boundary lubricating films are formed on machined-steel 
surfaces as chemically absorbed compounds resulting from the 
surface’s interaction with its environment. Preferred ﬁ lms may be 
formed by chemical treatment of the surface as it is processed 
and by additives in the lubricating ﬂ uid.
MIXED-FILM LUBRICATION 
This combination of EHD ﬁ lm and boundary conditions describes 
the regime in which many miniature, instrument and thin-section 
ball bearing contacting surfaces operate.
OPERATING TEMPERATURE 
MANAGEMENT
Lubrication can have a significant impact on the operating 
temperature of a bearing. This impact can either be positive or 
negative. Lubrication can positively impact bearing operating 
temperature when the lubrication method and quantity is 
properly conﬁ gured to both reduce heat generation and support 
heat removal from the bearing. Conversely, excessive lubricant 
quantity or too high a lubricant viscosity can result in excessive 
heat generation due to shearing of the lubricant.  
CONTAMINATION MANAGEMENT
Lubrication also can be used to manage bearing contamination. 
Greases provide some protection of internal geometry from 
external contamination. Circulated and ﬁ ltered lubrication is able 
to ﬂ ush wear particles from the rolling contact area.
GENERAL LUBRICANT TYPES
There are three general types of lubricants used in bearings:
 • Oil.
 • Grease.
 • Solid ﬁ lm.
Available lubrication types are summarized in table 12 on page 30.
OIL LUBRICATION
Oil lubrication is primarily used where low bearing friction torque 
is essential for the application. It is also used when the application 
requires the thermal and/or contamination control possible with 
the use of a proper oil system with oil cooling and/or ﬁ ltration 
capability. 

---

LUBRICATION FOR MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS
ENGINEERING
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  29
GREASE LUBRICATION
Greases are comprised of a base oil blended with a thickener 
in order to provide a reservoir, to maintain position within 
the bearing, and to provide some protection against external 
contamination. This typically results in it providing extended 
service life over oil lubrication.  
The actual contact surface lubrication performance of a grease- 
lubricated bearing is provided primarily by the base oil used in 
the grease.  
The capability of the grease to maintain its position in the bearing 
and the amount of impact it has on bearing torque are primarily 
a function of the thickener used in the grease.  
SOLID-FILM LUBRICATION
Solid-ﬁ lm lubricants are an alternative to conventional oil or 
grease lubrication. They are primarily used when the operating 
environmental conditions are beyond the allowable limits of 
oil and grease lubrication. Solid-film lubricants have been 
developed for speciﬁ c operating conditions.  Understanding the 
capabilities and limitations of a solid-ﬁ lm lubricant is important 
when selecting one for your application. Please consult your 
Timken engineer for assistance with solid-ﬁ lm lubricant selection. 
LUBRICANT SELECTION
Proper selection of a lubricant involves careful consideration 
of the following:
 • Operating temperature range.
 • Viscosity throughout operating temperature range.
 • Operating speeds including type (continuous or oscillatory).
 • Friction torque requirements.
 • Lubricant migration control.
 • Operating loads.
 • Material compatibility.
 • Corrosion protection.
 • Volatility/out gassing tolerance.
 • Storage life.
Military speciﬁ cations describe various classes of lubricants, 
both oils and greases, and usually relate to bulk properties rather 
than to speciﬁ c formulation. As a result, there are a variety of 
lubricants that meet the various lubricant MIL speciﬁ cations. 
When selecting a lubricant, the actual lubricant formulation and 
properties should be considered in addition to the MIL standard 
compliance.
TIMKEN LUBRICATION METHODS
Proper performance of a bearing will depend on both the lubricant 
type and the method of lubricant application. The amount and 
location of lubricant in the bearing, as well as the cleanliness of 
the lubricant depend on the correct method of application. Timken 
can apply a variety of application methods to meet a wide range 
of application requirements. Timken factory-lubricated bearings 
are provided with specially ﬁ ltered lubricants, allowing them to 
be installed directly upon removal from the package. We strongly 
suggest that no further processing be performed on the bearings 
that could affect the cleanliness of the lubricant. Timken offers a 
number of different lubrication techniques to assure the optimal 
lubricant amount and placement.
OILING METHODS
Dip and Drain: Slight excess of oil on all bearing surfaces, 
providing corrosion protection as well as ﬁ nal lubrication. Specify 
as LO or LY.
Dip and Centrifuge: Oil on all surfaces with quantity controlled 
by speciﬁ ed centrifuge level. Specify as LOC or LYC. Special G 
levels along with the time duration of the applied G load can be 
accommodated.
Vacuum Impregnate: Bearings with porous ball retainers are 
immersed in oil under vacuum followed by soak at room pressure, 
thereby forcing oil into pores. Specify as LOV or LYV .
Metered Application:  Speciﬁ c quantities of oil can be applied to

GREASING METHODS
Standard Greasing: A controlled quantity of grease evenly 
distributed into bearing cavity. The standard ﬁ ll quantity is one 
third full. Special quantities are available upon request.
Film Greasing: Apply grease-solvent mixture exclusively to 
bearing cavity to achieve controlled quantity. Specify as LGF or 
LYF, plus quantity in percent ﬁ ll or in milligrams.
Grease Plating: Apply grease-solvent mixture to entire bearing, 
coating all internal and external surfaces.  Specify as LGP or LYP.
SOLID LUBRICATION METHODS
Typically, solid lubricants are either applied as a coating directly 
on the raceways and/or rolling elements, or incorporated into the 
ball retainer for subsequent transfer to the rolling elements and 
raceways during operation.

PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION
ENGINEERING
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  31
The preloading of bearings is typical of applications where 
speed, stiffness or position control is critical. Preloading subjects 
bearing components to compressive forces that bring the balls 
into contact with their respective raceways and take up the initial 
clearances of the bearings. There are several basic reasons for 
preloading a ball-bearing set:
 • To remove radial and axial play for more precise positioning.
 • To control the axial and radial stiffness (compliance) of 
the system.
 • To maintain ball-race contact to prevent skidding 
and reduce noise. 
 • To improve load sharing between bearings.
Timken supplies preloaded bearings that are ﬂ ush-ground or have 
matched stick-out/stick-in as a pair to achieve a speciﬁ ed preload 
range when mounted together. Bearings also can be preloaded by:
 • Using springs.
 • Using differential spacers.
 • Gluing bearings (under load) onto a shaft or into a housing.
PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION
DB (BACK-TO-BACK)
Preferred for:
 • High moment stiffness.
 • High speeds.
 • High shaft to housing temperature differential.
DF (FACE-TO-FACE)
DF, or face-to-face mounting, provides higher compliance to allow 
for slight misalignment in the application. This arrangement is 
typically used where the shaft and housing do not have a large 
temperature differential.  
 • Low moment stiffness requirements – allows for slight 
misalignment.
 • Use where housing and shaft do not have a large 
temperature differential.

DT (TANDEM)
The DT, or tandem arrangement, provides for unidirectional 
axial load sharing between rows. This arrangement is often 
used with a spring preload and results in greater axial stiffness 
in one direction. 
 • Unidirectional axial load sharing.
 • Spring preloads.
 • Greater axial stiffness in one direction.

SELECTING PRELOAD
Selecting preload is highly dependent on the requirements 
of each application. For example, high-speed operation will 
require a different preload from an application where torque 
is to be minimized, or an application where bearing stiffness is 
to be maximized. Preload values are speciﬁ c to the end use of 
each bearing pair. For this reason, standard preload ranges are 
not applied to the miniature, instrument and thin-section series 
bearings.
Preload should be optimized based on the application 
requirements. Miniature and instrument bearings can be 
preloaded to very low levels with preload tolerances as low as 
one pound. Thin-section bearings are inherently very stiff and 
require a wider preload tolerance range than miniature and 
instrument bearings. Timken engineers can assist with selecting 
proper preload speciﬁ cations for each application.

PRELOAD AND DEFLECTION

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  33
DEFLECTION (COMPLIANCE)
Under applied loads, the balls and raceways will deﬂ ect elastically 
up to the yield point of the material. This limit is approximated by 
the static radial (Rs) and static thrust (Ts) load-capacity rating 
for each bearing.  
Due to differences in internal geometry, miniature, instrument 
and thin-section bearings have different deflection rates. 
Timken engineers are available to provide technical assistance 
in evaluating bearing deflection under specific application 
conditions.

LOAD RATINGS
ENGINEERING
34  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG
LOAD RATINGS 
Load ratings are provided as a guide for bearing selection when considering the application 
requirements. Differences in the methods of load rating calculation exist within the industry and 
care should be taken when comparing different manufacturers’ catalog load rating values.  Load 
ratings in this catalog are calculated for bearing steels using the mean of the standard radial play 
range or in the case of angular-contact bearings, the nominal contact angle tabulated.
This load rating is used in conjunction with the actual applied 
radial load (R) to calculate bearing fatigue life as follows: 

L10  =  16667  [
 C ]
 3

        N          R
Where:   
L10   =  Rating life in hours

N  =  Speed of inner ring rotation, in RPM

C  =  Dynamic load rating

R  =  Applied pure radial load, in lbs.
The rating life as deﬁ ned above relates solely to metal fatigue 
and assumes nominal bearing configuration, alignment, 
lubrication and cleanliness. In addition, these load ratings and 
life calculations are based on the application of a pure radial 
load. Note that the dynamic load rating value is used only in life 
calculations and, for instrument bearing applications, should not 
be approached in actual applied load. Your Timken engineer can 
assist in establishing fatigue life calculations for combination 
thrust and radial loads, pure thrust loads, outer-ring rotation, 
preloaded bearing pairs or probabilities other than 90 percent.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Bearing life may be deﬁ ned as the length of time a bearing will 
operate satisfactorily in the application at its operating speed 
under an applied load. Life predictions depend on careful 
deﬁ nition of failure criteria and consideration of the full range of 
operating conditions, including load cycles, operating speeds, 
mounting practice, environmental conditions and contamination.
The expected fatigue life under operating loads is often not the 
most important design consideration in the selection of instrument 
ball bearings. The dynamic load-rating ﬁ gures are presented 
primarily to permit a comparison of the load-carrying potential for 
bearings of similar material but differing in size, internal design 
and ball complement.
Life predictions are necessarily non-precise because of the 
interaction of these many parameters. There is an established 
method of calculating fatigue life, outlined in ISO/ABMA 
Standards. The ISO/ABMA rating Life (L10) is the number of 
revolutions, or hours at constant speed, that 90 percent of a 
group of nominally identical bearings will attain, or exceed, 
before the ﬁ rst evidence of fatigue develops. The dynamic load 
rating (C) is the constant radial load, stationary with respect to 
the outer ring, that a bearing can endure for a rating life of one 
million revolutions of the inner ring, or 500 hours at 33 1/3 RPM. 
The dynamic load rating is determined by bearing geometry, 
number and size of balls, bearing pitch diameter, and ring and ball 
material. The dynamic load rating (C) for each bearing is shown 
in the tabulations in the body of the catalog.

LOAD RATINGS
ENGINEERING
TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  35
STATIC LOAD RATINGS 
As increasing load is applied to a non-rotating bearing, a value 
will be reached at which permanent deformation of raceways 
and balls occurs. The resulting indentations or brinells become 
defects interfering with smooth operation and shortening 
bearing life. Static load ratings relate to limiting loads applied 
to non-rotating bearings, as in bearing mounting, or to shock 
loads applied to rotating bearings. Operating loads should not 
approach the rated value.
ISO/ABMA standards state that static load ratings depend on 
the maximum contact stress between the balls and either of the 
two raceways. It is affected by material, number and size of balls, 
raceway curvatures, raceway depths and contact angle.
A maximum contact stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) has been 
established as a satisfactory limit for most instrument-bearing 
applications and is the basis for static load ratings tabulated 
herein.
Where low vibration and frictional torque levels are of primary 
concern, applied loads should result in no more than 508,000 PSI 
(3.5 GPa) maximum contact stress, representing an approximate 
40 percent reduction from the tabulated static load ratings.
STATIC RADIAL LOAD RATINGS
The static radial load rating (Rs) is that pure radial load which, 
when applied to a non-rotating ball bearing, will result in a 
maximum stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) at the most heavily 
loaded ball contact.
STATIC THRUST LOAD RATINGS
The static thrust load rating (Ts) is that pure axial load which, 
when applied to a ball bearing, will result in: 
 • a maximum stress level of 580,000 PSI (4.0 GPa) and or
 • the limit at which the ball-raceway contact area is con-
tained completely within the raceway (i.e., the contact area 
is not truncated by the raceway shoulder or either ring).

SHAFT AND HOUSING FITS  
ENGINEERING
36  TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG   
SHAFT AND HOUSING FITS
Since Timken miniature, instrument and thin-section ball 
bearings are precision mechanical components, it is important 
that the size and tolerances of the shaft O.D., housing bore, and 
adjacent shoulders be carefully chosen and be consistent with 
the tolerances of the bearings.
The inner and outer rings of these bearings are relatively thin in 
cross section. These bearing rings will be distorted when ﬁ tted 
with interference on shafts or in housings which are not of true 
geometric form. Shaft and housing geometric dimensioning and 
tolerancing should meet or exceed that of the bearings. See pages 
38 and 39 for values based on journal size.
When designing mating components to be used with miniature 
and thin-section ball bearings, users must be aware of the 
effects of mating component design upon the bearing geometry. 
Clearance holes or tapped holes in close proximity to the shaft 
seat or housing bore can cause distortions in the ﬁ nal ﬁ tted 
bearing. Many customers need to install bearings easily, which 
will necessitate loose ﬁ ts on both the shaft and in the housing. 
Some customers also utilize adhesives during fitting of the 
bearing, in which case the shaft and housing sizes will be dictated 
by the clearance required by the adhesive. During ﬁ nal assembly 
of a bearing with adhesive, much care must be taken to keep 
adhesive, primer, sealer, curing agents, etc., out of the bearing, 
or early bearing damage will result.
Shaft and housing diameters should be held to tolerances equal 
to the bore and O.D. tolerances of the bearing to be used. Use of 
larger tolerances negates the advantages of precision positional 
control built into the bearing itself. 
A signiﬁ cant percent of the interference ﬁ t reduces the internal 
clearance of the bearing. Interference fits are even more 
signiﬁ cant in their effect on increasing preload in factory duplex 
preloaded pairs. 
If variation in tolerance results in unacceptable range of 
interference or clearance ﬁ ts between the bearing and the shaft 
and/or housing, selective assembly of coded bearings matched 
with similarly graded shaft and housing diameters may be utilized. 
This approach can be more economical than machining shafts 
and housings to tighter tolerances. See page 37 for coding of 
bores and O.D. style.
This information assumes that the shaft and housing are 
manufactured from materials with a similar coefﬁ cient of thermal 
expansion as bearing steel (5.6 E-6 to 6.6 E-6 in./in./° F). See ﬁ g. 
24 for coefﬁ cients of expansion.
SHOULDER HEIGHTS
Shaft and housing shoulders are critical to the performance of 
the bearing.
Housing and shaft ﬁ llet radii for the shoulders should not exceed 
the radius (r) dimension listed in the product data tables (starting 
on page 50). The product tables also provide shaft and housing 
shoulder diameters for Timken standard bearings.
Sleeves, spacers, snap rings and similar devices can be used to 
provide shoulders, if the appropriate tolerances are maintained.

CODING 
When more precise ﬁ ts than can be achieved with standard 
tolerances are desired, the bore and/or O.D. dimensions can be 
coded to the nearest 0.000100 in. or, if necessary, to the nearest 
0.000050 in. Bearings so coded are packaged in groups and 
labeled with their specific code. Coded bearings can be 
selectively assembled with components that are similarly coded 
so the actual ﬁ ts are closer to the average ﬁ t speciﬁ ed. Bearing 
codes for the various tolerances are listed in table 13.
For miniature, instrument and thin-section bearings, the codes are 
determined on the basis of the minimum bore and the maximum 
O.D. size.
The basic symbol ZDM is used to deﬁ ne or specify a condition 
where both bores and both O.D.s of a preloaded pair are selected 
to be the same size within the increment indicated. It is not 
necessary that the bore and O.D. be of the same code symbol. 
The code symbol of the pair will be that of the smaller bore and 
the larger O.D. of the pair (maximum material condition).
Also available on metric bearings is coding to 1 micrometer 
increments rounded off to 0.000040 in. Use preﬁ x M, as in MZD, 
etc., to specify.
To avoid confusion between digits or letters and symbols, hyphens 
are used before bore and/or O.D. symbols. The bore code is the 
ﬁ rst digit.

BEARING TESTING
BEARING TORQUE TESTING
Ball bearing frictional torque measurements are dependent upon 
bearing speed, load, alignment, internal geometries and surface 
ﬁ nishes. Since bearing applications involve inﬁ nite variations of 
these parameters, Timken has standardized production tests for 
measurement of both starting torque and running torque. These 
tests compare bearing performance levels under standardized 
test conditions but do not necessarily simulate actual application 
levels. These tests meet or exceed guidelines established in MIL-
STD-206, the most comprehensive torque speciﬁ cation in the 
industry. Torque testing conditions other than the ones deﬁ ned 
in MIL-STD-206 are available upon request.
STARTING TORQUE MEASUREMENT
Starting torque, deﬁ ned as the torque necessary to start bearing 
rotation under an applied thrust load, is measured under a 75 gm 
thrust load on bearings with an O.D. of 3/8 in. or less, 400 gm on 
larger bearing sizes, and is expressed in milligram-millimeters. 
Torque testing is performed for customers requiring veriﬁ cation 
that a bearing is capable of meeting a certain torque limit. Often, 
customers will deﬁ ne a maximum starting torque which is limited 
by the available power to start rotation in an application.

GENERAL CONDITIONS
The maximum starting values in the table 15 are subject to speciﬁ c 
deﬁ nitions and test conditions covered in ABMA Standard 12 for 
instrument ball bearings. These standard torque values are valid 
for bearings that are:
 • ABEC 7P tolerances.
 • Open or shielded bearings.
 • Stainless 440C or SAE 52100 material.
 • Crown or ribbon retainers.
 • Lubrication with MIL-PRF-6085 oil.
Timken interprets the test conditions such that prior to testing, the 
bearings are to be cleaned with a ﬁ ltered solvent, lubricated with 
one drop of ﬁ ltered MIL-PRF-6085 oil (or an equivalent viscosity 
lube) and demagnetized. Testing is to be done in a clean room 
environment.
The bearings are to be tested a minimum of 10 starts (5 per side) 
with the test load applied axially in a vertical position.

RUNNING-TORQUE MEASUREMENT
Running torque is the resistance to rotation under specific 
operating parameters. Timken can perform running-torque 
measurements on most miniature, instrument and thin-section 
ball bearing types and sizes. When testing miniature bearings to 
MIL-STD-206, a low rotational speed of 2 RPM is used and loads 
of 75 gm or 400 gm are applied axially to the bearing. Thin-section 
bearings are tested under user speciﬁ ed loads and speeds. This 
type of testing is usually reserved for customers who require an 
estimate of the average torque it takes to operate the bearing. 
Typically, customers will deﬁ ne a maximum running torque so they 
are sure that the driving components in their system will have the 
ability to operate correctly on a continuous basis.

TORQUE TRACES
Bearing running-torque traces can help ensure maximum 
performance of bearings by visually identifying problems in 
existing bearing equipment or identifying problems prior to use.
Torque testing can be used to diagnose a variety of issues with 
bearings, including, for example, poor geometry, particulate 
contaminants, retainer hang-up, bruises or damage to the 
raceway.
Running-torque traces provide the following data:
 • ART - average running torque.
 • PRT - peak running torque.
 • AHW - average hash width.
 • MHW - max. hash width.

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  43
PACKAGING/LABELING
The packaging of Timken bearings is designed to ensure that 
clean and undamaged product is delivered to the customer. 
The containers provide easy identiﬁ cation, complete protection 
in transit and storage, and best meet the use and handling 
requirements of the customer. To prevent contamination, 
packaging operations are performed in a Timken clean room. The 
same rigid cleanliness standards are observed in the packaging 
section as are speciﬁ ed for the inspection, lubricating and testing 
sections of the clean room.
A wide range of packaging materials and methods are available to 
accommodate a variety of customer needs. Examples of standard 
packages available:
• Intimate packaging:
• Pill pack.
• Vial pack.
• Nylon bag.
• Polyethylene bag.
• Secondary packaging:
• Box.
• Aclar® pouch.
• Aluminum foil pouch.
The necessary type or method of packaging should always 
be speciﬁ ed on drawings or purchase orders. If no speciﬁ c 
packaging is requested, bearings will be packed in pill pack 
strips or individual clean bags. Timken engineers can assist in 
developing speciﬁ c packaging instructions for each application.
To reduce the possibility of bearing contamination at the user’s 
facility, all outer packaging, such as boxes, cartons, or secondary 
pouches, should be removed and the intimate wrap cleaned 
before being taken into clean areas.
INTIMATE PACKAGING 
PILL PACK
Pill packs are formed from strips of transparent, heat-sealable, 
polymer ﬁ lm. This material is impervious to most lubricants, offers 
low vapor permeability and low gas penetration. The  static-free 
and clean ﬁ lm is heat-sealed into a strip of ﬁ ve pouches with one 
bearing in each pouch. Each pouch is labeled. To prevent damage 
during shipment, multiple pill pack strips are placed in a unit box 
and then enclosed in a sturdy, corrugated shipping carton.  Filler 
material is used to prevent shifting and to strengthen the package.
VIAL PACK
For high production requirements, packaging in transparent
vials (that may be opened and resealed) is available. Each 
vial contains up to 50 bearings and is capped on each end. A 
label is applied to each vial. Several vials are normally packed 
in a polyethylene bag and each bag is labeled with the same 
information as on the individual vial label. The vials are then 
placed into a shipping container.
Fig. 28. Miniature pill pack.
Fig. 29. Vial pack.
NYLON BAG
Intimate bags of Nylon 6 material are available. The nylon material 
provides an excellent air and moisture barrier along with good 
chemical resistance.  These clean bags are certiﬁ ed to NASA JPG 
5322.1 Level 25 cleanliness or better. Bearings are heat-sealed 
into individual bags. If requested, bags can be backﬁ lled with 
dry nitrogen and/or vacuum heat-sealed for added protection. 
POLYETHYLENE BAG
Intimate bags of polyethylene provide a good moisture barrier and 
chemical-resistance. Bags are produced from material meeting 
the requirements of A-A-3174, Type 1 and are in compliance with 
MIL-DTL-117, Type I, Class B, Style 2. Cleanliness is certiﬁ ed to 
NASA JPG 5322.1 Level 50 or better. Bearings are heat-sealed

BEARING HANDLING

TIMKEN MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION BEARINGS CATALOG  45
BEARING HANDLING 
Miniature, instrument and thin-section ball bearings are precision 
devices that provide long service life when properly speciﬁ ed and 
applied. However, unskilled or careless handling will inevitably 
result in poor performance and life. Many problems encountered 
by miniature, instrument and thin-section bearing users are 
created through improper handling.
Particulate contamination into miniature, instrument and thin-
section ball bearings is probably the most universal problem and 
one of the more difﬁ cult to control.
Miniature, instrument and thin-section ball bearings are used in 
torque and noise-sensitive applications. Even very small particles 
of foreign matter, even a few microinches in size can degrade 
the quiet-running qualities and low-torque values of the bearing.
Particulate contamination must be controlled throughout the 
entire life of the bearing. Timken miniature, instrument and thin-
section bearings are manufactured, assembled, inspected, tested 
and packaged under rigidly controlled conditions. It is imperative 
that bearing users extend good handling practices so that the 
full performance potential of Timken bearings may be realized.
Some fundamentals to preserve bearing cleanliness are:
 • Clean work areas.
 • Properly dressed personnel.
 • Cleaned and maintained bearing handling instruments 
and related equipment.
 • Proper handling techniques.
 • The customer should maintain demagnetized bearing 
condition.
Timken bearings should be kept in the original, unopened 
packages until ready for installation. Only the actual required 
number of bearings should be removed from the package at a 
time. Bearings should be removed from the protective package 
only in a clean, dry and dust-free atmosphere. If the bearings are 
removed from their packaging, any unused bearings should be 
stored and properly identiﬁ ed in clean, dry, covered containers.
It is preferable to handle bearings with speciﬁ cally designed, 
handheld instruments, such as precision non-magnetic tweezers. 
In some instances, it may be necessary to handle bearings by 
hand. In this case, clean, dry, talc-free, silicon-free ﬁ nger cots 
or gloves should be worn. Microscopic skin particles shed easily 
from hands and can cause bearing contamination. Furthermore, 
most bearing steels, other than AISI 440C, will corrode rapidly 
from moisture and other residue left after skin contact.
A controlled work environment for handling bearings will help to 
reduce contamination and corrosion problems. Ideally, a clean 
room should be used for installation of precision assemblies. If 
not available, an individual hooded work-station or laminar ﬂ ow 
bench may be used. 
Timken bearings are thoroughly inspected, washed and lubricated 
to stringent specifications prior to final packaging. Timken 
bearings are usually ready for immediate installation without the 
need for further cleaning or lubrication.
If any bearings become accidentally contaminated, it is suggested 
they be returned to Timken for cleaning and relubrication.
Note: Timken bearings are thoroughly demagnetized prior to shipment to the 
customer. Since bearings can potentially become partially magnetized during 
shipment, it is suggested that the customer perform a demagnetization process, 
if applicable.

Fig 32. Correct and incorrect mounting practices.
BEARING INSTALLATION
 • The mounting components, shafts/housings/related hard-
ware and tooling should be thoroughly cleaned prior to any 
contact with the bearing.
 • The overall performance of a ball bearing is signiﬁ cantly  
affected by the geometry of the mating components. Shaft 
or housing diameters and geometry must be established 
before any attempt is made to install the bearings (see shaft 
and housing tolerances, page 38-39).
 • Interference ﬁ ts with the shaft or housing provides positive 
retention and location. Excessive interference between the 
bearing and mounting surfaces will reduce the designed 
internal clearances.
 • Geometric errors such as out-of-roundness will be trans-
ferred to the mating bearing ring. Therefore, a round bear-
ing can be distorted by an out-of-round shaft or housing.
 • Clearance ﬁ ts do not affect bearing geometry, but also do 
not provide for the same degree of positive positioning as 
interference ﬁ ts. Clearance ﬁ ts are prone to fretting corro-
sion at the mounting interfaces during normal operation. 
Installation tooling must be properly designed and manufactured. 
Important points to consider are:
 • Tooling should be designed to be easily cleaned and remain 
burr free.
 • Tooling should mount the bearings squarely onto the shaft 
or into the housing. Misalignment during installation can 
severely distort a bearing.
 • Tooling must be designed and used in a manner that will not 
damage a bearing. 
 • All installation forces must be transmitted through the  
mounting ring and not through the balls. Transferring the 
force through the balls will result in damage to the balls and 
races, resulting in high torque and noise. See ﬁ g. 32.
 • Shock or impact techniques should never be used to mount 
the bearing. 
 • Differential thermal expansion methods may be used in the 
assembly to reduce the amount of force required to mount 
the bearing. Bearings may be temporarily heated up to 
275° F (+135° C) to aid in assembly onto shafts.

1400 mg-mm peak starting torque.

V followed by a number indicates peak running 
torque limit in hundreds of mg-mm. 
For example, V13 indicates a bearing with less than 
1300 mg-mm peak running torque. Torque is measured 
under a 75 gram thrust load for bearings having an 
O.D. of 3/8 in. or less. Larger cataloged bearings are 
measured under a test load of 400 grams.

THIN-SECTION BALL BEARINGS
THIN-SECTION 
BALL BEARINGS 
Thin-section ball bearings, 
with their large complements 
of small-diameter balls, provide 
greater stiffness and lower torque 
while permitting a signiﬁ cant reduction 
in weight and space when compared to 
standard-section bearings. These advantages 
have found wide acceptance in many critical applications 
where thin bearing cross sections are important.
This section of the catalog represents a portion of products 
offered by Timken. Timken also produces many specialized 
bearings, assemblies and bearing-related products for 
particular applications where a standard bearing will not do.
Contact your Timken engineer for assistance in choosing the 
most appropriate standard or custom Timken product for your 
speciﬁ c application.
