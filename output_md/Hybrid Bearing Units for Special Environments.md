CERABALL SERIES
Ceramic bearing material of the FYH-SN series
Ceraball features
◎Reduced maintenance costs
Re-lubrication intervals can be signiﬁ cantly extended 
or eliminated altogether.
◎Green bearings
Excessive grease discharge can be eliminated thereby 
contributing to a cleaner environment.
◎Independent operation
Supplementary items such as cooling devices and 
automatic grease replenishment systems can be 
eliminated.
◎Low friction
Low friction operation reduces the amount of energy 
required thereby saving electricity and money.
◎High stress resistance
The threat of shattering from foreign matter incursion 
is greatly reduced which creates a safer working 
environment.
◎Non-conductive
Electric arcing is eliminated.
In 1984, for the first time in Japan, FYH succeeded in the production of total ceramic bearings from start-to-finish 
production of raw materials. Since that time, user feedback has confirmed that this series has proven itself as the 
ultimate choice for a multitude of special operating environments. After more than two decades of continual 
development, this series has been evaluated as "the most reliable maintenance-free bearing" for any industry, and 
it has evolved to include a variety of options to satisfy many speciﬁ c needs.
The ceramic balls and precision inner and outer rings of the Ceraball bearing demonstrate 
excellent wear resistance and provide longevity and stable performance in applications 
where temperature extremes, high speed, torque, and corrosion are factors.

FYH has established a superior production process from mixing ingredients to molding, sintering, and processing. 
Compared with silicon nitride balls produced by other manufacturers, we are proud of the overwhelming high 
strength of the Ceraball, and we can promise consistently high quality, better product performance, and longer life.

Standard bearings operating in excessively high/low-temperature conditions, or in 
environments where liquids or gasses are present, require a great deal of 
maintenance and monitoring, and they are often subject to sudden failure. 
Ceraball bearings incorporating fluorinated grease (operating range: -60 to 260°C 
(-76 to 500°F) ) allow for extended lubrication intervals and longer life.
When liquids or gasses are present in higher concentrations, standard bearings 
operating in temperatures above 180°C (356°F) can deteriorate from surface 
oxidation rather quickly. The Ceraball series can be incorporated into stainless 
steel bearings to prevent rapid corrosion. If the operating temperature exceeds 
230°C (446°F) then seals are omitted and only slingers (Z-seal) are utilized.

Standard bearings utilizing grease as a lubricant cannot function well above 260°C 
(500°F). FYH has developed a solid self-lubricating lubricant which can operate in 
temperatures over 450°C (842°F) particularly at lower RPM’s > dn 5,000.

High speed applications produce a great deal of centrifugal force which is further 
increased by standard steel balls. The specific gravity of the Ceraball is 3.2 which 
is less than half of a steel ball’s specific gravity of 7.8. With about 40% of the load, 
the effects of centrifugal force are reduced and the life of the Ceraball bearing is 
greatly extended.

When operating in a vacuum, base oils often evaporate from the grease and deterioration 
of the lubricant occurs. Because high-quality fluorinated grease is used, which is enclosed 
by fluorine seals within the ball path, this problem is eliminated. The Ceraball provides 
stable performance to 10-5 Pa under normal atmospheric temperatures.

temperatures, and it is well-suited to vacuum-based machinery.

Film / chemical production

For particularly strong solid, liquid, or vapor based acids and bases, FYH has 
adopted a separation hardened stainless steel for the inner and outer rings as well 
as the Y7 ceramic series that incorporates a special corrosion resistant ceramic 
ball originally developed by FYH.

Where severe corrosion, metal abrasion, and rust are concerns, polyetheretherketone 
(PEEK) plastic inner and outer rings are employed as well as the Y8 ceramic series that 
incorporates a special corrosion resistant ceramic ball.
It is usually used in the condition of a very light load.

Special contaminate-free environments require clean-operating components. Because it 
needs less grease, the Ceraball can meet these requirements and, through a wide range 
of temperatures, it releases much less debris than conventional bearings.
High-temperature applications requiring solid graphite lubricant may discharge 
only a small amount of graphite.
