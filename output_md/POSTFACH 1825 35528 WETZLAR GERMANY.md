Ever higher demands are being made on bearing systems, and a 
variety of techniques and new materials have been developed 
that are designed to meet the needs of today’s demanding and 
extremely varied technical and commercial applications.  
IBC Wälzlager GmbH, Industrial Bearings and Components, 
rises to the challenge by constantly enhancing its performance, 
continuously optimising its products and processes and by ex-
panding its product range.
Together with our customers, we define objectives and consist-
ently pursue our common objectives. And by keeping our com-
munication channels with the customer open at all times, even 
very specific customer requirements are swiftly and purposefully 
converted into commercial solutions.
We have also been traditionally involved in academic work: We 
are in close working partnerships with colleges and universities, 
both in the field of research and development and as our point of 
reference for vocational training.
Our capability to innovate can be seen in our intense research 
and development efforts. Basic research, material engineering, 
tribology and bearing design, and the improvement of manufac-
turing processes make up our main areas of research and devel-
opment. The use of different types of materials for bearing com-
ponents, for instance, is one of the decisive factors in increasing 
the performance of the products.
Apart from its use in research and development, our modern 
equipment also forms the foundation which enables us, together 
with our skilled staff, to produce rolling bearings to the highest 
quality specifications. It also ensures our quality in the long term. 
And because we use such sophisticated machinery, we pay 
special attention to the people who are part of the process.
Although ceramic rolling elements were initially used only in 
specialised applications, they are now part of the standard pro-
gramme of high precision bearings. They are used in the ma-
chine tool manufacturing sector or in electric motor engineering, 
for instance. Enhanced cage materials like PEEK are used for 
fast-running high precision bearings or in a high temperature 
environment.
High precision bearings that are grease-lubricated in our factory 
and additionally sealed are maintenance-free, meaning that “for 
life lubrication” becomes a reality. This fact contributes both to 
simpler, customer-friendly designs and to simpler assembly.
IBC Wälzlager’s product range is further expanded by ATCoat 
thin dense chromium coated bearings that are designed for 
specialised applications. The advantages of high precision bear-
ings coated with ATCoat include service-life boosting character-
istics as well as outstanding wear and corrosion protection prop-
erties.
In this publication you will find a whole variety of products, as 
well as variations in each product. The products showcased here 
include high precision angular contact ball bearings and high 
precision cylindrical roller bearings for machine tool manufactur-
ers, the printing-press and textiles machinery industries and for 
all applications where extremely high requirements exist with 
regard to running accuracy, reliability, high rotational speeds, 
low-friction and quiet running, stiffness, load, heat generation 
and the given installation conditions, either as single requirement 
or as combination of above.
The overview of IBC’s range of high precision bearings is further 
supplemented by criteria for choosing a suitable bearing and its 
appropriate dimensioning; also included are criteria that will help 
you to design your bearing application and to mount the rolling 
bearings.
IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings can be supplied 
with a variety of contact angles, various rolling element diame-
ters and rolling elements made of steel or ceramics and either 
sealed or open. The bearing you choose will depend on the 
intended application. You may also choose a variant that offers 
direct lubrication via the outer ring. This range of options will

help you select the right bearing for a specific application, de-
pending on the requirements you have for speed, load rating, 
stiffness, feasibility of lubrication and other ambient parameters. 
The product portfolio of IBC Wälzlager GmbH contains diverse 
and innovative solutions that ensure that both locating and float-
ing bearings function in a secure way. We offer both high preci-
sion angular contact ball bearings with a structural locating bear-
ing function and high precision cylindrical roller bearings with a 
floating bearing function. As an alternative, you may choose 
bearing rings coated with ATCoat that prevent fretting corrosion 
and ensure sliding fit.
Other components of bearing systems, like locknuts or labyrinth 
seals, have been a fixture of IBC Wälzlager’s product range for 
many years now. They are used for the bearings of ball screws, 
for example. The many different variations that exist for a certain 
product help the user to optimise his economic efficiency.
Continuous quality control, which is built into our manufacturing 
process, and our commitment to, and responsibility towards, 
compliance with safety and environmental aspects guarantee the 
consistently high quality of our products. Our efficient quality 
management system has been implemented and certified pursu-
ant to DIN EN ISO 9001 for the engineering, design, develop-
ment, manufacture and sale of rolling bearings and linear guides.
In-depth information on the various rolling bearing designs, and 
on choosing the right bearing and securely integrating it into the 
individual design, is to be found in our separate product cata-
logues that each focus on a specific design.
Our comprehensive product range and the ability to support our 
customers on-site all over the world via our service and technical 
departments enable us, to develop specific and efficient bearing 
solutions for our customers, and together with our customers.

IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings have been de-
signed for all rolling bearing applications that make great demands 
on reliability, stiffness, speed capability and running accuracy; 
either as a single requirement or as a combination of the above. 
The many different types available allow spindle manufacturers 
across different sectors of industry as well as special-purpose 
mechanical engineering firms to optimise their spindles by focus-
ing on the aspects that are most important to them. Technology 
and economic efficiency thus meet to form a winning combination.
In order to achieve both improved performance and reduced costs 
for rolling bearings, the many application-specific requirements  
for running accuracy, load carrying capacity, rotational capacity, 
 stiffness, vibration characteristics and installation space call for a 
whole variety of bearing series, each providing different solutions 
and dimensions that have different design characteristics.
Dimensional series
The IBC product range contains many different variations of 
single-row high precision angular contact ball bearings.
According to the German standard DIN 616 each type is assigned 
a dimensional series that consists of a diameter series and a 
width series. The dimensional series defines the outside diameter 
D, the bearing width B and the corner radii ‘r’. The identification 
number for the dimensional series is prefixed by the code “7”, 
which stands for “angular contact ball bearing”.
Each dimensional series has special characteristics that make it 
suited to certain types of rolling bearings.
Dimensional series 18 is the series with the smallest cross-sec-
tion for high precision angular contact ball bearings; this series  
is designed for the highest speeds with simultaneously low re-
quirements for load carrying capacity. There is an increase in 
overall width and outside diameter with dimensional series 19, 10 
and so on.
Dimensional series 19 and 10 are used for higher speeds or small 
radial cross-sections, whereas dimensional series 02 and 03 are 
used for high loads with relatively low speeds. If great demands are 
made on the stiffness of rolling bearings, it is usually best to choose 
high precision angular contact ball bearings from dimensional series 
19, as these have the greatest possible number of rolling elements 
and allow for large shaft diameters with a given outside diameter.
Contact angle
The contact angle is defined as the angle between an imaginary 
straight line joining the points of contact of the rolling elements 
with the raceways and a line perpendicular to the rotational axis.
IBC has tailored the internal design of its high precision angular 
contact ball bearings to the diverse requirements of the machine 
tool building industry. IBC therefore offers as standard high preci-
sion angular contact ball bearings with three different contact 
angles. Each dimensional series is designed with a contact angle 
of 15°, 25° or 30°. The high-speed angular contact ball bearings 
(H and CBH design) have a contact angle of 18°.
The different contact angles meet individual requirements for 
combined loads with regard to stiffness and rotational speed 
characteristics. IBC also manufactures precision angular contact 
ball bearings with contact angles of 35°, 40° and 60°. You will 
find information on these bearings in the publications Angular 
Contact Ball Bearings 40° TI-I-4044 and Ball Screw Support 
Bearings TI-I-5010.
Designs
As variants to the standard design, angular contact ball bearings 
can be supplied with smaller or ceramic rolling elements in order 
to achieve higher speeds.

So-called hybrid bearings retain the original bearing geometry 
but are equipped with ceramic rolling elements. The high-speed 
H design utilises smaller rolling elements within an unchanged 
outer geometry; the CBH design combines both smaller and 
ceramic rolling elements. The CBH design is suitable for the 
highest speeds, but does not have such a high load carrying 
capacity.
Hybrid bearings equipped with ceramic rolling elements and 
rings made of bearing steel are used not only in high-speed 
applications; their many advantages also include their reliability 
and their extended grease service life. The combination of 
harder and lighter ceramic rolling elements reduces the rolling 
bearing’s heat output and the wear of the lubricant. They also 
improve rolling conditions in an unfavourable lubrication envi-
ronment and provide insulation to prevent electrical current 
flowing through the bearing. This leads to greatly reduced sys-
tem costs.
IBC Wälzlager GmbH has also made wide-ranging additions to 
dimensional series 19 and 10 supplementing them with an opti-
mised generation of rolling bearings with the suffix X (CX and 
EX). As can be seen, this variation is identified as an extension 
to the contact angle designation. The purpose of this design is to 
close the gap between the standard and high speed series, by 
providing bearings that are closely matched and controlled. This 
new design is characterised by low frictional torque, leading to 
significantly reduced heat emission, as a result of design tech-
niques applied to the inner bearing geometry.
Sealed IBC high precision angular contact ball 
bearings
As a result of the increasing demand for grease-lubricated high 
precision angular contact ball bearings, IBC have extended their 
range of sealed high precision angular contact ball bearings that 
are greased ready for use. The standard lubrication fill, imple-
mented during the manufacturing process, ensures the optimal 
grease type and quantity are applied, which has a positive effect 
on bearing life and machine performance. IBC high precision 
angular contact ball bearings are filled with suitable high-perfor-
mance grease as standard that covers a wide range of operating 
temperatures. The bearings are ready for immediate installation 
and operation, subject to normal grease running-in procedure. 
Further information on this topic can be found in Chapter 7 
 (Lubrication).
The high precision angular contact ball bearings are ideally 
protected against contamination and air currents due to being 
sealed with non-contact seals (2RSZ) on both sides. These 
seals do not limit the suitability of the bearings for high rotational 
speeds, and in the case of vertical or pivoting spindles the seals 
additionally act as grease retention washers. The rolling bear-
ings from dimensional series 18 and 19 as well as H execution 
bearings come with a standard lubrication fill of GS36 grease;  
all other bearings come with a standard lubrication fill of GS75 
lubricant. There is no special marking for the standard lubrica-
tion.
The permitted operating temperature of these seals, which are 
made of oil-resistant and wear-resistant acrylonitrile butadiene 
caoutchouc (NBR) and are supported by a reinforced steel plate 
to provide rigidity, lies between -40° and 120°C.
Oil/air lubrication
Oil/air-lubricated high precision angular contact ball bearings are 
axially supplied with an oil/air-mixture via intermediate rings. The 
reference circle for the required lubrication input is detailed in the 
dimension tables. No changes need to be made to the design of 
the rolling bearings themselves.

Special designs
Should grease-lubricated high precision angular contact ball 
bearings be required to run at or above their limits, IBC high 
precision angular contact ball bearings with outer ring lubrication 
are an ideal option.
A circular groove and a radial supply hole permit direct lubrica-
tion. O-rings integrated into the outer ring act as a seal for the 
housing. The dimensions of the grooves and recesses are con-
tained in Chapter 7 (Lubrication).
High precision angular contact ball bearings with outer-ring lubri-
cation reduce the number of elements that are part of structure 
around the bearing, leading to savings in installation space and 
cost reduction.
Apart from the designs mentioned, IBC also produces a number 
of specially designed high precision rolling bearing variations. 
Should you be interested in such a design, please contact our 
technical customer support teams. We will be glad to help you 
find a solution to meet your specific bearing requirements.
Bearing materials
Rolling bearing rings and rolling elements are generally manu-
factured from vacuum degassed bearing steel 100Cr6 (1.3505). 
Ceramic rolling elements are also available in the ceramic mate-
rial silicon nitride Si3N4. A detailed description of materials can be 
found in Chapter 9 (Materials).
Heat treatment
The bearing rings are, as standard, stabilised up to a service 
temperature of 150 °C. Higher-quality heat treatment is available 
upon request for higher temperatures. More detailed explana-
tions on this, e.g. types of treatment, restrictions and suitability, 
are contained in Chapter 9 (Materials).
Cages
As standard, IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings 
are equipped with a  fabric reinforced phenolic resin cage that 
already meets the requirements of many types of application.
If the high precision angular contact ball bearing is subject to 
special operating conditions, like high temperatures or extreme 
accelerations, we provide suitable cages made of alternative 
materials. Please contact us if your application needs a special 
type of cage.
A detailed description of the individual cage materials is included 
in Chapter 9 (Materials).

Bearings with ATCoat coating
In addition to the executions already mentioned, IBC also manu-
factures high precision bearings with an ATCoat thin dense chro-
mium coating.
You will find a more detailed description of the ATCoat coating  
in Chapter 10 (IBC High precision rolling bearings with ATCoat 
coating) and particularly in the publication ATC Technology 
Coatings.
Special mention should be made of the ATCoat thin dense chro-
mium coating of the outer ring in the case of a high precision 
angular contact ball bearing that is used as a floating bearing. In 
this case the coating prevents fretting corrosion if the outer ring 
of the high precision bearing requires a fit that is not too tight, to 
allow for axial displacement.

2.4 Preload and stiffness
70
A machine tool is seldom a single purpose machine. Based on 
this a spindle can not be sized to meet a single set of boundary 
conditions. Eventually sizing a machine tool spindle is based on 
the total range of the basic application of the machine. If the 
machine is a multipurpose machine each critical operational 
condition needs to be calculated.
If high precision angular contact ball bearings are mounted in 
sets, the ground-in preload essentially determines the character-
istics of speed, heat and stiffness. However, high rotational 
speed and great stiffness are contradictory characteristics. So 
the best possible compromise needs to be considered.
There have been examples where extremely sophisticated bear-
ings have been designed with elaborate hydraulic devices to 
create variable preloads
In order to meet diverse requirements, the high precision angular 
contact ball bearings have therefore been developed not only 
with different-sized rolling elements, and thus different load 
ratings, but also with different preloads.
The default preloads have been designated as X for extra light,  
L for light, M for medium, and H for high preloads. This grading 
is suitable for the great majority of applications.
The preload of a high precision angular contact ball bearing is 
defined as the axial force that needs to be applied in order to 
align the faces of inner and outer rings; the rings are slightly 
offset against each other when the single bearing is in an un-
loaded state. The bearing thereby becomes elastically deformed 
without, however, sustaining damage.
The reciprocal of bearing elasticity is stiffness. Stiffness indicates 
the resisting force of a preloaded bearing in newtons over its 
spring deflection in µm. Preload and stiffness are interdepend-
ent. As a rule, the stiffness of a bearing does not increase in a 
linear fashion in relationship to the preload. The axial and radial 
stiffness of a pair of angular contact ball bearings depends both 
on the preload and the contact angle.
The following table-values specify the axial stiffness Sa and the 
radial stiffness Sr for each individual angular contact ball bearing. 
The same values are true for a pair of angular contact ball  
bearings of the same type that are set against each other. The 
relevant factors needed to calculate the preload and stiffness for 
further sets of high precision angular contact ball bearings are 
contained in Chapter 2.7 (IBC High precision angular contact 
ball bearing sets).
The preload stresses the high precision bearings in the same 
way as outside axial forces do. In dimensioning the rolling bear-
ing, quite often a good balance needs to be struck between 
preload and stiffness on the one hand and attainable speed and 
life time on the other.
Due to the lower static load-carrying capacity of the ceramic rolling 
elements as compared to standard bearings of the same geometry, 
high precision hybrid rolling bearings have slightly lower preloads. 
But the stiffness of hybrid bearings is still significantly higher at 
identical preload, because ceramic rolling elements are harder.
The values for axial and radial stiffness contain parameters that 
are affected by tolerances that relate to the manufacturing pro-
cess. The actual stiffness of a rolling bearing may only be deter-
mined when it is fitted in its individual mounting situation.
For this reason the values in the tables have been rounded up  
or down; the values are only meant to be used to compare the 
different kinds of high precision rolling bearings with each other.

Preloads and stiffness

2.5 Differential measurements for preloads
98
In order to attain the required stiffness for a bearing’s given 
rotational speed it may become necessary during spindle adjust-
ment to adjust the built-in preload.
This can be achieved with the aid of spacer rings whose differ-
ence in length leads to a change in preload class.
The differential measurements of the individual preload classes 
relative to each other are given in the following tables for this pur-
pose. The differential measurement is the distance in µm by which 
the rings of a single angular contact ball bearing is additionally 
axially displaced relative to one another in order to achieve the 
next preload class. For an O-arrangement, for example, shortening 
the inner spacer ring by the value given in the table makes the 
preload move up into the next higher class. In an X-arrangement, 
the same is true for the outer spacer ring. The preload is reduced if 
the procedure is carried out the other way round.
The measurements of custom-built spacer rings should be care-
fully documented, and the rings should be kept with the spindle 
even during repair work. If the spacer rings need to be replaced, 
the existing differential measurement needs to be determined in 
order to restore the previous preload with the help of the given 
differential measurement of the high precision bearings that need 
to be replaced.
Should the bearing need to carry higher loads, spacer rings that 
measure the width of the bearing permit subsequent trouble-free 
insertion of a further rolling bearing.

2.6  IBC High precision universal angular  
contact ball bearings
106
All IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings are univer-
sally ground. They may therefore be used singly and can be 
combined to a bearing set arrangement defined by the end-user 
without any loss of performance. Using universal angular contact 
ball bearings is a great advantage, especially from the point of 
view of stocks and the availability of components.
Universal angular contact ball bearings are manufactured as 
single bearings known as U, and as duplex sets known as DU. 
Single bearings are marked with a V-marking on the outer ring that 
allows one to recognise the direction of axial force more easily. 
The V-marking points in the direction in which the axial force is 
transmitted through the outer ring. The V-marking also indicates 
the point of maximum ring thickness. The advantage of universal 
bearing-sets lies in the fact that their bores and outside diameters 
are sorted as standard in the IBC manufacturing process.
During manufacture, IBC universal angular contact ball bearings 
are adjusted and matched in such a way that they can be mount-
ed in any type of arrangement (O- or X-arrangement, or tandem 
mounting) and with any number of bearings positioned next to 
each other.
Fig. 2.8:  Universally ground IBC high precision angular contact  
ball bearings in O-arrangement, X-arrangement and in  
tandem mounting
The bearing arrangement is carried out by the customer with the 
help of the small arrow marker.
In order to facilitate mounting, we also manufacture sets with an 
additional V-marking that runs on the outer rings, e.g. DB, TBT, 
QBC, and other combinations.
This is explained in more detail in the following Chapter 2.7  
(IBC High precision angular contact ball bearing sets).

2.7 IBC High precision angular contact ball bearing sets
108
The minimum mounting for a spindle consists of one high preci-
sion angular contact ball bearing on each side. Both bearings are 
therefore arranged at a suitable distance from each other. In this 
arrangement, the required preload adjustment is carried out by 
means of a suitable locknut with a defined tightening torque or 
with a suitably ground flange cover.
The correct adjustment of the two individual high precision angular 
contact ball bearings is crucial for the successful operation of this 
type of bearing arrangement. If the adjustment is not carried out 
correctly, the life time of the bearing may be reduced through high-
er friction losses and associated higher operating temperatures.
If the load carrying capacity of a single bearing is insufficient, or 
should the bearing  need to absorb axial forces in both directions, 
then high precision angular contact ball bearings with universally 
ground-in preload can be used in sets.
During manufacture, IBC high precision angular contact ball 
bearing sets are pre-adjusted and matched to each other in such 
a way as to maintain the predefined preload value of a single 
bearing within the set and to ensure that the load bearing capac-
ity within the angular contact ball bearing set is spread evenly 
across the individual bearings.
Arrangements
The O- and X-arrangements of two high precision angular con-
tact ball bearings allow for an axial load to be absorbed in both 
directions, as shown in fig. 2.8. High axial forces in only one 
direction are supported by tandem mounting. Forces that are 
even stronger are absorbed by high precision angular contact 
ball bearing sets with more than two high precision angular con-
tact ball bearings positioned in a single direction. The angular 
contact ball bearing set is therefore generally set against a fur-
ther angular contact ball bearing, or a further set, that absorbs 
the axial load in the opposite load direction.
Because the effective load centre is wide, the O-arrangement is 
better suited to absorb tilting moments.
That is why angular contact ball bearing sets with this type of 
arrangement produce a relatively rigid bearing. In contrast to the 
O-arrangement, the effective load centre in the X-arrangement is 
narrow and the X-arrangement is therefore less rigid but slightly 
more tolerant towards tilting.
With tandem mounting, the contact lines run parallel to each 
other and at the same angle to the separating line of the angular 
contact ball bearing.
IBC also offers other high precision angular contact ball bearing 
sets. Should the design used not permit the setting of angular 
contact ball bearings in tandem mounting against a further con-
tact ball bearing, or against another set of contact ball bearings, 
then it is possible to combine tandem mounting with an O- or 
X-arrangement, for instance. If there are special requirements 
with regard to stiffness and bearing load, then it is advisable to 
use tandem mountings with three or four angular contact ball 
bearings.

Bearing sets and marking
Angular contact ball bearing sets with different combinations are 
used, depending on the requirements that have to be met. In 
order to meet these requirements, IBC manufactures matched 
angular contact ball bearing sets in addition to single bearings. 
These sets are provided with a V-marking that spans the whole 
set, in addition to the individual V-marking on the single bearing.
The sequence of the individual bearings is clearly defined by the 
marking within the set and the marking also indicates the main 
direction of axial load of the angular contact ball bearing set.
The correct mounting direction must be observed so as not to 
impair the functioning of the angular contact ball bearing set and 
in order to allow for the adjustment of the built-in preload to be 
utilised. The marking on the set helps check the exact arrange-
ment of the high precision angular contact ball bearings on the 
shaft, even after mounting. The marking also helps reduce po-
tential mounting errors.
The inner ring faces are marked with a small circle ‘o’ at the 
point of maximum ring thickness and/or maximum radial runout. 
When installing high precision angular contact ball bearing sets, 
care should be taken to ensure that the circles on both the outer 
and inner rings are aligned. The best possible radial runout is 
achieved if the outer ring marker is aligned with the point of the 
largest housing bore and the inner ring marker is aligned with 
the point of the smallest shaft diameter.
In order to achieve balanced load bearing characteristics for all 
the angular contact ball bearings within a set, high precision 
angular contact ball bearings with the same restricted outer and 
inner ring tolerance are combined. The measurements Dmp and/
or dmp of these angular contact ball bearings are specified as 
average values Dgm and/or dgm with regard to their tolerance 
classes and marked as such on the external packing and foil 
bag. Chapter 4 (Tolerances) contains detailed information on 
tolerances and their designation as well as their respective  
characteristics.

Bearing sets with balanced preload
In addition to arrangements of high precision angular contact ball 
bearings where each bearing has the same preload, we also 
supply balanced angular contact ball bearing sets. In this type of 
arrangement, high precision angular contact ball bearings with 
single preload are combined with a high precision angular con-
tact ball bearing having double or triple preload value.
The use of these arrangements is especially advisable if a high 
precision angular contact ball bearing is combined with more 
than one bearing and the preload relief of the single bearing is to 
be safely avoided.
Misalignment
Misalignment generally should be avoided. Skewing leads to a 
certain amount of compulsory rotation, which in turn leads to 
higher running noise and a reduction in bearing life time. The 
X-arrangement is slightly less susceptible to misalignment than 
the O-arrangement.
Rotational speed factors for angular contact 
ball bearing sets
The rotational speeds mentioned in the tables above are based on  
a high precision single angular contact ball bearing that is lightly 
preloaded. Because they are subject to self heat generation, 
preloaded high precision angular contact ball bearings that are 
combined to form sets do not permit permanent operation with the 
rotational speeds given in the tables. Various reduction factors apply 
to these sets, depending on the arrangement of the high precision 
angular contact ball bearings in the set and on their preload.
Detailed information on rotational speed factors is contained in 
Chapter 6 (Speed coefficients).

Preload and stiffness of bearing sets
The numerical values for preload and stiffness given in the ta-
bles are valid for the individual high precision angular contact 
ball bearing. A significant change in axial stiffness will occur, 
however, depending on the way the angular contact ball bear-
ings are arranged within the set and also depending on the di-
rection of the force.
The radial stiffness of a set of angular contact ball bearings, 
calculated as the sum of the radial stiffness of all the individual 
bearings, is approximately valid only for those angular contact 
ball bearing sets in a symmetrical arrangement that also have an 
absolutely uniform load distribution between the angular contact 
ball bearings within the bearing set. Angular contact ball bearing 
sets in an asymmetrical arrangement are subject to a reduction 
in stiffness under radial load due to the effect of the slightly dif-
fering contact angles.
Table 2.2 below is valid for the different types of arrangements of 
angular contact ball bearings in bearing sets, and for both direc-
tions of axial force. The table specifies the factors for axial and 
radial stiffness as well as the factor that shows the axial force of 
angular contact ball bearings within the set that will cause a 
relief of load, when compared to the preload.

2.8 IBC High precision locknuts
112
IBC High precision locknuts with fine thread are used with high-
precision applications because of their high accuracy. The secur-
ing systems integrated into the various locknuts permit simple 
and accurate mounting and provide for lasting stability.
The securing systems do not change the circular cross-section 
of the shaft, and no additional changes occur, so the securing 
systems do not cause grooves to form on the shaft. Because of 
the superfinishing of the thread and the contact surface, IBC 
high precision locknuts attain an axial face runout that conforms 
to ISO standard tolerance class IT3.
The different designs of IBC high precision locknuts are suited to 
a wide range of applications. The high precision locknuts are 
manufactured in various widths  suitable for different axial loads. 
The securing devices may be axially or radially accessible, de-
pending on the design. A design fitted with an additional labyrinth 
seal can also be supplied.
Dimensional series
Precision locknuts from the MMR series are designed for appli-
cations with limited installation space, or in order to save weight. 
In the MBA and MBC series, the locking of a precision locknut 
which cannot be reached radially is secured axially with acces-
sible clamping screws. This production series requires a greater 
width due to its specific design. The permissible axial load is the 
same as for the MMR precision locknut. Starting from a thread 
diameter of 45 mm, the locknuts of the MBC series are also 
manufactured with four internal hexagon socket screws, to pre-
vent break-out occurring during fast acceleration. The MMRB 
execution has a radial securing device, and its cross-section is 
the same as the MBA and MBC precision locknuts; it therefore 
permits higher loads and higher tightening torques. Under the 
designation MMRBS and MBAS, the MMRB and MBA production 
series are also manufactured with an integrated labyrinth seal.
Information on the recommended precision locknut for the re-
spective high precision bearings can be found in the last column 
of the angular contact ball bearing data tables.

Chapter 8 (Mounting of High precision rolling bearings) contains 
more detailed information on the fitting of high precision locknuts 
as well as on the required tightening torque for each dimensional 
series of IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings.
If you are using high precision angular contact ball bearings of the 
718... dimensional series, the high-precision locknuts may project 
above the outside diameter of the high precision angular contact 
ball bearings. In this case you will need to fit a spacer ring.
The publication Precision Locknuts TI-I-5020 contains more 
detailed information on the product range and all technical data 
for the many types of IBC precision locknuts.

3. IBC High precision cylindrical roller bearings
116
The use of high precision rolling bearings in machine tools 
makes great demands on the running accuracy of these bear-
ings. IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings combine run-
ning accuracy characteristics with great stiffness and load carry-
ing capacity while at the same time providing for a high speed-
capacity with a smaller cross section height. This smaller cross 
section height allows for lower centre distances for multi-spindle 
arrangements. High precision cylindrical roller bearings make for 
ideal floating bearings because they are able to compensate for 
heat-related changes in length that occur in adjacent parts.
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings with cages are avail-
able in many different variations. They are manufactured as single 
row bearings in the 19 and 10 dimensional series, and as double 
row bearings in dimensional series 30 and 49. The bore diameter 
and outside diameter of both the single and double row cylindrical 
roller bearings are identical for the particular diameter series.
The high precision cylindrical roller bearings with the HN desig-
nation have an enhanced inner geometry that has been adapted 
to the high precision angular contact ball bearings and their 
rotational speed capacity. These bearings are the ideal comple-
ment to the performance range of the high precision cylindrical 
roller bearings.
High precision cylindrical roller bearings with tapered bore are 
designated by the suffix K and manufactured with a taper angle 
of 1:12. They are mostly used in machine tool manufacture, 
because the tapered bore allows for adjustment of the radial 
clearance and preload by means of axial displacement on the 
corresponding taper of the shaft. 
Designs
The rolling elements of high precision cylindrical roller bearings 
are guided between two fixed shoulders that are either posi-
tioned on the outer ring (NNU) or on the inner ring (N and NN). 
The other rolling bearing ring of the two does not have any 
shoulders. Both in the case of the single and the double row 
precision cylindrical roller bearings, the bearing ring with the 
fixed shoulders and the roller assembly may be separated from 
the non shoulder bearing ring, i.e., the bearings are not self-
retaining. This greatly contributes towards simpler mounting and 
dismounting of the rolling bearings.
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings are characterised 
by an ideal combination of load carrying capacity, stiffness 
and achievable rotational speeds. NNU design rolling bearings 
achieve great system stiffness in bearing situations that are char-
acterised by very low-profile construction; however, in comparison 
to the NN design they have a lower load carrying capacity. 
The single row high precision cylindrical roller bearings from the 
dimensional series 19 and 10 are designed as speed-optimised 
rolling bearings. A further increase in rotational speed may be 
achieved by cutting the number of rollers in half (option Q852) or 
by using ceramic rollers (option CR).

The cylindrical roller bearings with the suffix S have a circular 
groove and radial supply holes for direct lubrication. O-rings 
integrated into the outer rings provide a seal in the housing.
All double row IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings are 
fitted with a lubrication groove with three holes on the outer ring 
(designation W33, 120° arrangement) in order to guarantee 
effective lubrication.
High precision cylindrical roller bearings with outer-ring lubrica-
tion reduce the number of elements that are part of the ambient 
design of the bearing; this results in more installation space, and 
it also reduces system costs.
Designs that utilise ceramic rolling elements permit higher 
speeds and have greater system stiffness. Both factors lead to 
higher-quality machining results. The stress to the rolling bearing 
itself is also reduced, which in turn leads to lower heat genera-
tion within the bearing. This fact has a positive impact on lubrica-
tion service life and leads to longer maintenance intervals. A 
further advantage of hybrid rolling bearings is that they are much 
less sensitive to high acceleration or deceleration.
Other production series may also be manufactured with ceramic 
rollers upon request. The hybrid version of these high precision 
cylindrical roller bearings is suitable for the highest rotational 
speeds; this comes at the cost of a reduced static load rating, 
however.
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings from the NN, NNU 
and N designs only absorb radial forces. They permit uncon-
strained axial displacement inside the rolling bearing in both 
directions between the shaft and the housing. The maximum 
permitted axial displacement is specified by the value s in the 
tables.
Special designs
IBC manufactures special designs of high precision cylindrical 
roller bearings for specialised applications. Please contact our 
applications engineers in this case. They will be glad to help you 
find a solution to your special applications requirements and 
bearing designs.
Bearing materials
Rolling bearing rings and rolling elements are manufactured from 
vacuum degassed bearing steel 100Cr6 (1.3505). Rolling ele-
ments are also available in the ceramic material silicon nitride 
Si3N4. A detailed description of materials is included in Chapter 9 
(Materials).
Heat treatment
As standard, the bearing rings are stabilised up to a service 
temperature of 150 °C. For higher temperatures higher-quality 
heat treatment is available upon request.
Outside the machine tool industry, cylindrical roller bearings with 
higher heat stabilisation, especially NNU bearings, are used with 
greater bearing clearance.
Further details like designation, limitations and suitability are 
contained in Chapter 9 (Materials).
Cages
Various cage options are available depending on the design and 
the dimension of the high precision rolling bearing. A detailed 
description of the individual cage materials is included in Chap-
ter 9 (Materials). Please contact our technical service depart-
ment if your rolling bearing needs cages that have to meet spe-
cial requirements.

Bearings with ATCoat coating
Besides the executions already mentioned, IBC also manufac-
tures high precision bearings with an ATCoat thin dense chro-
mium coating.
You will find a detailed description of the ATCoat coating in 
Chapter 10 (IBC High precision rolling bearings with ATCoat 
coating) and particularly in the publication ATC Technology 
Coatings.
Tolerances
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings are manufactured to 
conform to tolerance class SP as standard, but higher accura-
cies are possible. You will find the exact values in the tables in 
Chapter 4 (Tolerances).
The radial clearance of high precision cylindrical roller bearings 
with tapered bore is greater than that of cylindrical roller bearings 
with cylindrical bore. On request, we also manufacture tapered 
bore bearings with the smaller clearance of cylindrical roller bear-
ings with cylindrical bore. This is especially beneficial in the ad-
justment of the bearings. Detailed information on this can be 
found in Chapter 8 (Mounting of High precision rolling bearings).
Misalignment
It should be noted that in the case of high precision cylindrical 
roller bearings misalignment leads to a certain amount of com-
pulsory rotation. This in turn leads to higher running noise and 
may also result in a reduced life time.
Please contact our technical application teams in cases where 
misalignment may occur. Misalignment of the inner ring in refer-
ence to the outer ring that is permissible and does not reduce 
the life time, depends on the load ratio c/p (dynamic load rating 
to dynamically equivalent bearing load) and should be checked 
in each case.

Tolerance classes
The desire for rolling bearings with ever greater precision has 
led to the introduction of a range of tolerance classes with an 
increasing number of subdivisions.
Various tolerance classes have been established and are cur-
rently in use, each with its own designations.
Description of tolerance classes
Existing tolerance classes have been described by various or-
ganisations. The designation of the classes differs, however, 
according to the manufacturer.

4.1  Dimensions and measuring principles 
IBC High precision rolling bearings
139
The basic dimensions of a high precision rolling bearing com-
prise its bore d, its outside diameter D and its width B. The basic 
dimensions also include the tolerances for the bore dmp as well 
as for the outside diameter Dmp. The tolerance for the width Bs 
depends on the bore of the inner ring and is applicable to both 
bearing rings.
The accuracy for the running of a rolling bearing is also subject 
to defined tolerances. Apart from the desired rotation around the 
central axis of the high precision rolling bearing, unwanted  
displacements and tilting movements occur in both axial and 
radial directions. There are maximum values and/or limit values 
for these effects too. In most mounting situations, the maximum 
radial runout of the inner ring Kia is especially important. IBC high 
precision angular contact ball bearings are manufactured as 
standard to conform to tolerance classes P4A, P2H and P2A. 
The high precision cylindrical roller bearings are manufactured to 
conform to tolerance class SP as standard.

4.3  Sorting and chamfer dimensions 
IBC High precision rolling bearings

Sorting
The dimensional tolerances of the bearing, along with the dimen-
sional tolerances of the housing, determine the exact and repro-
ducible locating-bearing or floating-bearing fit of a high precision 
rolling bearing. In order to simplify the allocation of high preci-
sion rolling bearings and bearing sets to shafts and housings, 
the diameter deviations of IBC high precision rolling bearings are 
sorted by bore diameters and outside diameters and are speci-
fied with a group mean value. Classifying the permissible overall 
tolerance for the outside diameter Dmp and the bore dmp in 2 or 
3 sorting groups respectively is done on the basis of diameter 
and quality (P4A, P2H, P2A). Up to an overall tolerance of 5 µm 
there are 2 groups; above that value there are 3 groups. This 
results in 5 and 9 sorting combinations respectively.
Chamfer dimensions
The chamfer dimensions are standardised according to the table on 
the right for all rolling bearings. The chamfers of the adjacent parts,  
e.g. housing and/or shaft, have to be manufactured accordingly.

according to DIN 620, Part 6

4.5  Radial clearance 
IBC High precision cylindrical roller bearings
As standard, IBC manufactures high precision cylindrical roller 
bearings to conform to the tolerance class SP with radial clear-
ance C1. The bearing clearance is not explicitly specified. Apart 
from the class mentioned, further bearing clearance classes are 
available, e.g. SPC2X or C3.
The bearing rings of high precision cylindrical roller bearings of 
the same type are not interchangeable.
The values for the bearing clearance of high precision cylindrical 
roller bearings are different for bearings with cylindrical bore 
from those with tapered bore, even if they belong to the same 
tolerance class. When fitting a high precision cylindrical roller 
bearing on to a tapered shaft it is possible to adjust the bearing 
clearance specifically via the displacement. This option, and the 
simple design, make high precision cylindrical roller bearings 
ideally suited for use in the machine tool industry. Further infor-
mation on this issue is contained in Chapter 8 (Mounting of High 
precision rolling bearings).

4.6 Tolerances of adjacent parts

Design of adjacent parts
The positional accuracy and form accuracy of the adjacent parts 
must be adjusted to the accuracy requirements of the high preci-
sion rolling bearings. Rolling bearings adapt to form deviations in 
the shaft and the housing because the bearings have compara-
tively slender ratios of cross section. The fit selected depends on 
the rotational conditions of the bearing rings under consideration.

5. Life Time Calculation
147

---

Even under suitable operating conditions, and even if the high 
precision rolling bearings have been mounted properly, a bearing 
may still fail. The service life of high precision rolling bearings is 
limited by various factors.
The length of time during which a high precision rolling bearing 
works satisfactorily is called its “life time”. Material fatigue, vibra-
tions, contamination or lubrication-failure may occur during this 
time span. In the following observations we will be ignoring the 
causes that can lead to the failure of a high precision rolling 
bearing without noticeable prior indication; these causes include 
faulty design, inadequate maintenance, faulty mounting, and 
wrong bearing dimensioning.
Fatigue
Fatigue of the material that high precision rolling bearings are 
made of is caused by the rising stress to the material that occurs 
when high precision rolling bearings rotate under load. Towards 
the end of the life of the bearing, “pittings” appear on the running 
surfaces or the rolling elements; an initial occurrence may be 
followed by progressive pitting of the material.
Various factors are responsible for material fatigue; they can 
really only be covered with reference to statistics. The definition 
of a theoretical reference value for “fatigue life time” therefore 
refers to a very large quantity of rolling bearings running under 
the same conditions. The fatigue life time is reached as soon as 
10% of all bearings have failed. The fatigue life time may be 
specified with reference to the number of revolutions or to the 
runtime in hours.
In addition to fatigue life time, lubrication life time is another deci-
sive factor in operating a high precision rolling bearing. Particular 
rules apply for the calculation of this factor. In the case of high 
precision rolling bearings that are permanently monitored, other 
parameters may also be crucial in determining their life time, 
including temperature, bearing noise and vibrations.
Basic rating life
In terms of pure definition, 10% of a great number of high preci-
sion rolling bearings of the same type, running under the same 
conditions, may fail within a basic rating life of L10. If a constant 
rotational speed is used, the basic rating life may also be speci-
fied in terms of a time L10,h.
Dynamic load rating
The dynamic load rating is the constant load of a high precision 
rolling bearing with a rotating inner ring for which 1 million revolu-
tions will be achieved with a probability of 90%. It is considered as 
a central radial load that is constant with regard to magnitude and 
direction. It is based on numerous experiments and is a perform-
ance figure that may be calculated with the aid of empirical rules.
Static load rating
The static load carrying capacity of a high precision rolling bear-
ing is defined by the static load rating C0. This is the load that a 
stationary high precision rolling bearing can bear with a maxi-
mum permanent plastic deformation of 1/10,000 of the rolling 
element diameter.

Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Combined loads, comprising both axial and radial components, 
can often act on high precision rolling bearings. In order to relate 
the forces that actually act on a high precision rolling bearing to 
the dynamic load rating, the equivalent dynamic bearing load P 
is calculated from the effective force components. This load is 
hypothetical and corresponds to the dynamic load rating with 
regard to the point of application of the load and its effective 
direction.
Once you have calculated the equivalent dynamic bearing load it 
may be mathematically related to the dynamic load rating in 
order to determine the life time.
Equivalent static bearing load
The necessary static load rating C0 is calculated from the equiva-
lent static bearing load P0, which is additionally weighted by the 
static load safety factor s0.
Achieving adequate static load safety depends on the operation 
of the rolling bearings and on their required running smoothness. 
High precision angular contact ball bearings require a minimum 
static safety factor of 1; high precision roller bearings require a 
minimum static safety factor of 1.5.
If high demands are placed on the running smoothness of the 
rolling bearing, the above mentioned values for static load safety 
must be at least doubled. If the rolling bearing is subject to shock 
impact loads, an additional increase of the static load safety by 
factor 1.5 is required.
Static load carrying capacity of dynamically 
designed bearings
If the static load is known, the equivalent static bearing load 
should be calculated for the type of rolling bearing that was 
chosen on the basis of the computation of the dynamic load 
carrying capacity; the equivalent static bearing load should then 
be checked against the static load safety given above.
Comparing the effective static bearing load with the static load 
rating also means that the equivalent static bearing load P0 has 
to be calculated. Calculation is done in analogy to the calculation 
of the equivalent dynamic bearing load.

Determining the axial and radial load factors
To begin with, the axial and radial load factors from table 5.1 are 
determined for angular contact ball bearings that permit a com-
bined load. The first step for angular contact ball bearings with a 
contact angle of 15° is to calculate the ratio Fa / i · C0.
In so doing, i stands for the number of high precision rolling bear-
ings in a set. The bearing-related factor e for single bearings or 
bearing sets with the same alignment is given in table 5.1a; for 
high precision rolling bearings that are set against each other, the 
factor e is given in table 5.1b next to the value that comes as 
close as possible to the outcome of the calculation Fa / i · C0. The 
factor e may also be interpolated in the relevant manner. In the 
next step, the ratio of the force components Fa / Fr that impact 
from the outside is calculated and is compared to the value of the 
bearing-related factor e that is contained in the respective table.
If the ratio is smaller than e, then the axial component is omitted 
and only the radial load factor X = 1 is retained. If the ratio is 
greater than e, then the factors X and Y are read off from the 
same line in the table as their respective factor e. In the case  
of angular contact ball bearings with a contact angle of 25°, e 
always has the value of 0.68, and the ratio Fa / i · C0 is not calcu-
lated. The static radial load factor X0 and the static axial load 
factor Y0 may be taken straight from tables 5.1a and 5.1b for the 
different kinds of contact angles and bearing arrangements. 
There is no need to calculate these factors.
Two angular contact ball bearings that are arranged at a dis-
tance from one another in an X- or O-arrangement are consid-
ered to be a system if there is a symmetrical load application; 
the system factors for the calculation of the equivalent bearing 
load are contained in table 5.1b. In all other cases it will be nec-
essary to calculate the individual bearing forces, and the factors 
will be taken from table 5.1a.
After applying the formulas 5.2 and 5.3, the equivalent dynamic 
bearing load P and the equivalent static bearing load P0 will be 
known.
If the equivalent static bearing load does not exceed the static 
load rating multiplied by the static load safety s0, then the single 
bearing possesses an adequate static dimension. The equivalent 
dynamic bearing load for a single bearing is worked out using 
the life time calculation according to equation 5.1.
The dynamic load rating that is necessary for this calculation is 
contained in the tables in Chapter 2 (IBC High precision angular 
contact ball bearings) and Chapter 3 (IBC High precision cylin-
drical roller bearings) for high precision rolling bearings.

Bearing combinations
Should multiple single-row precision angular contact ball bear-
ings of the same kind be fitted next to each other in the same 
arrangement, the static overall load rating of this combination is 
calculated from the individual static load ratings (see below):
The dynamic load rating of a set is calculated as follows:
The general reduction in the dynamic load rating of a set by the 
value i0.7 according to DIN ISO 281 is based on the assumption 
that, within a set, bearings with standard tolerances have bore 
and outside diameters that differ from each other and therefore 
carry unequal portions of the load.
Sorted and marked high precision angular contact ball bearings 
with narrower tolerances carry loads in a much more equal way 
and therefore result in better operational safety.
The life time of a set of high precision rolling bearings can be 
calculated if the effective forces that act on each single bearing 
are known, as the failure of a single high precision rolling bear-
ing within the system leads to the failure of the entire system.
As each single high precision rolling bearing has a 90% prob-
ability of reaching its life time, the failure probability of the overall 
system is the product of the failure probabilities of the single high 
precision rolling bearings.
In effect, this means that the life time of the overall system is 
shorter than the shortest life time of any high precision rolling 
bearing that is part of the system. Taking into account the life 
times of the single high precision rolling bearings, a system life 
time L10h,ges may be calculated using equation 5.7.
A note on bearing sets with inner preload
The method described above is not valid for preloaded high 
precision rolling bearings, which are often set against each other 
in bearing sets, because the preload of these bearings stresses 
the rolling bearings in addition to the external  forces. In order to 
calculate the life time of a preloaded set of high precision rolling 
bearings one needs to look at the forces acting on each indi-
vidual bearing. A method for calculating the life time that takes 
into account preloading is described on the following pages.

From the axial loads Fa,A and Fa,B and the radial loads Fr,A and Fr,B 
which have been obtained by the above method, the equivalent 
dynamic bearing load for each high precision rolling bearing is 
now determined in accordance with equation 5.2. Factors X and 
Y are taken from table 5.1a. The application of equation 5.1 
gives an individual life time for each high precision rolling bear-
ing, and these life time values are then combined in accordance 
with equation 5.7 to obtain the system life time.
A bearing set with three high precision 
 angular contact ball bearings
Taking into account an external radial load, the following is true 
for the preload of the individual high precision rolling bearings:
if  
Fv,A < Fv / 2,      then apply as correction     Fv,A = Fv / 2
and 
Fv,B < Fv          then apply as correction     Fv,B = Fv           
Therefore the axial loads of the individual high precision rolling 
bearings are obtained from the following calculation:
If Fa,B < 0 then there is no more preload. The axial load of high 
precision rolling bearing B is zero, and the two high precision 
rolling bearings A each carry half the external axial load. In the 
opposite case, both high precision rolling bearings A are un-
loaded and are no longer subject to axial load. In this case, high 
precision rolling bearing B carries the full external axial load Fae.

In order to determine the radial and axial load components Fr 
and Fa of each bearing in an arrangement of preloaded angular 
contact ball bearings, the external radial loads Fre, the external 
axial loads Fae and the axial preload Fv as well as their load 
allocation, have to be taken into account. The load allocation 
may be calculated from the spring compression of the rolling 
elements that conforms to a power law with the exponent 2/3; 
the assumption is that the radial force is equally divided between 
the single rolling bearings.
A bearing set with two high precision  
angular contact ball bearings

Due to the wedge effect produced by contact angle , an exter-
nal radial load Fre changes the whole preload Fv in the following 
way:
if  
Fv,ges < Fv,    than apply as correction     Fv,ges = Fv       
The axial loads of the individual bearings A and B can now be 
calculated with the adjusted preload Fv, ges:
If the result is Fa,A or Fa,B < 0 the respective high precision rolling 
bearing is in an unloaded state. The axial load then equals zero, 
and the axial load of the other bearing corresponds to the exter-
nal axial load Fae.
The external radial load Fre is now distributed for the single bear-
ings in accordance with the power law of the spring compression 
mentioned above, taking into account the allocation of the axial 
loads.

The radial load rate for each high precision rolling bearing with 
regard to the external radial force is as follows:
Further calculation is carried out by applying equation 5.2 in 
conjunction with table 5.1a, as well as equation 5.1 and 5.7; this 
gives the life time of the overall bearing system.
Further combinations of angular contact ball 
bearings
Departing from the above calculation, and taking into account 
the uneven distribution of the load in accordance with equation 
5.24, if axial load predominates, the calculation of the life time 
may be carried out with defined load parameters according to 
table 5.2.
In order to determine the resulting axial bearing load, the bearing 
preload Fv needs to be taken into account along with the external 
load Fae. In bearing arrangements with an unequal number of 
bearings per load direction, this results in variable axial stiffness, 
axial load ratings and life times, depending on the number of 
bearings for each direction. The proportion of the preload and 
the external load that needs to be taken into account for each 
bearing is contained in table 5.2.
For bearing sets made up of universal bearings with more than 
two bearings and a rigid preload Fv that cannot to be ignored, the 
life time for each single bearing should be calculated as follows.
The radial load is distributed between all the high precision roll-
ing bearings in a set:
The axial load Fa,Einzellager results from the formulas in accordance 
with table 5.2. The high precision rolling bearings in load direc-
tion experience the greatest stress. The high precision rolling 
bearings in counter-load direction only carry part of the preload 
or are completely unloaded.
The equivalent bearing loads P are then determined in each 
case with the help of the resulting bearing loads Fr, Einzellager and 
Fa, Einzellager according to formula 5.2.

The radial load rate for each high precision rolling bearing with 
regard to the external radial force is as follows:
As in the case mentioned above, the equivalent dynamic bearing 
load is obtained by further calculation using equation 5.2 in con-
junction with table 5.1a that contains the axial and radial load 
factors. From there, equation 5.1 leads to the life time of the 
individual bearings, and equation 5.7 then produces the life time 
of the overall system.
A bearing set with four high precision angular 
contact ball bearings
Because of the contact angle of angular contact ball bearings, 
the radial load influences the preload of the individual high preci-
sion rolling bearings as follows:
if     Fv,ges < Fv / 2,     than apply as correction     Fv,ges = Fv / 2
The axial loads of the individual high precision rolling bearings 
are thus obtained by doing the following calculation:
If Fa,B < 0 then there is no more preload. The axial load of high 
precision rolling bearings B is zero, and the two high precision 
rolling bearings A each carry half the external axial load. In the 
opposite case, both high precision rolling bearings A are un-
loaded and are no longer subject to axial load. In this case the 
high precision rolling bearings B each carry half the axial load 
Fae.

If a variable spring preload is used instead of a rigid preload, the 
following is true for the high precision rolling bearing (or bearing 
set) that experiences more stress:
Load spectrums
For a load spectrum made up of forces that change over time, 
and possibly including variable speeds, a mean equivalent bear-
ing load is determined in accordance with equation 5.27.
The mean rotational speed itself is also made up of portions of 
time for the respective speeds that are expressed as a percentage.
Determining the bearing size
After preselecting a possible arrangement of high precision 
angular contact ball bearings, and after applying the equations 
mentioned above to the given external bearing loads and to the 
assumed preload of the bearings, all individual equivalent dy-
namic bearing loads P are known.
 After adjusting equation 5.1 as follows
the required dynamic load rating may be determined by assum-
ing a life time for a given speed; the dynamic load rating may 
then be used for purposes of comparison with the table.

5.2 Expanded modified life time calculation
155
Over the years, the method of calculating the life time of a high 
precision rolling bearing has become more sophisticated by the 
inclusion of new criteria. The calculating method that was applied 
used to consist solely of a function of load rating C, of the equiva-
lent dynamic bearing load P and of the mean operating speed nm. 
But various other life time coefficients have been added over time.
Expanded modified life time calculation
The so-called modified life time Lna with its factors a1, a2 and a3 
that was commonly used in the past has been superseded by 
the expanded modified life time calculation L10,nm according to 
DIN ISO 281 as of 1993.

The probability factor a1 remains. This factor permits the conver-
sion of the life time expectation of 90%, or the failure rate of 
10%, to other, higher life time expectations. The aDIN factor that 
has now been introduced covers various parameters that are 
listed below.
In addition to load, the following parameters are taken into ac-
count, which in turn are based on multiple factors:
The expanded modified life time calculation is based on the 
basic rating life L10 in accordance with equation 5.10, weighted 
by the life time expectation factor a1 in accordance with table 5.3 
and the life cycle coefficient aDIN.
Determining the life cycle coefficient
The life cycle coefficient aDIN is read off from diagrams 5.3 and 
5.4, after the parameters ec· Pu / P and κ have been determined, 
or it is calculated in accordance with equations 5.37 to 5.42.
Fatigue limit load
This takes into account the fatigue limit of the ring material. 
Without going into detail here, the fatigue limit load is roughly 
defined with the aid of the following formula for rolling bearings 
up to a mean bearing diameter dm of 150 mm:

Contamination coefficient
Hard and firm contaminants that are present in the lubricant can 
lead to lasting impressions being made in the raceways during 
the rolling-over process. Local stress peaks caused by over 
rolling the contaminations reduce the life time of the high preci-
sion rolling bearings. A reduction in life time due to hard particles 
will depend on the size of the bearing, the lubricant film thick-
ness (viscosity ratio κ) and on the size, type, hardness and 
number of particles. Other sorts of contamination, like the inflow 
of fluids, cannot, however, be considered in connection with this 
coefficient.
If severe contamination occurs (ec → 0), failure due to wear will 
become a likelihood. The actual life time will then be much short-
er than the calculated life time.
Viscosity ratio
The viscosity ratio κ is used to rate the quality of the lubricant 
film formation. It defines the ratio of lubricant viscosity ν at oper-
ating temperature to the reference viscosity ν1.
With κ = 1, the separative lubricant film will be exactly achieved. 
Procedural method: with the help of diagram 5.1 initially deter-
mine the reference viscosity ν1 subject to the reference diameter 
Dpw and the speed n.

From diagram 5.2, relating to viscosity and temperature, the 
referenced operational viscosity ν is then read off below the 
point at which the anticipated operating temperature t intersects 
with the diagonal graph of the reference viscosities at 40 °C.
From this, the viscosity ratio κ is then established:

In the mixed friction range κ < 1, higher values may be achieved 
with the help of suitable additives: Wear can be reduced, corro-
sion be counteracted, friction reduced and the adhesion of the 
lubricant in the lubrication gaps improved with the help of special 
additives like solids,or polar and/or polymer active substances.
Additives should be used if the referenced operational viscosity 
for ball bearings is < 13 mm2/s, if it is < 20 mm2/s for roller bear-
ings, and if the basic speed rating is relatively low, at  
dm· n < 10,000.
The viscosity ratio κ, in accordance with equation 5.33, is deter-
mined by means of diagrams 5.1 and 5.2; but it may also be 
calculated.
The following is valid for the reference viscosity ν1:
For lubricants with a density that deviates from the reference 
density of ρ1 = 0.89 g/cm³ at 20 °C the following formula applies:
For a viscosity ratio κ < 1 and a contamination coefficient 
ec > 0.2 the value κ = 1 in calculations can be used, if a lubricant 
with active EP additives is used. The life cycle coefficient must 
then, however, be limited to aDIN < 3. In the case of severe con-
tamination (ec < 0.2) the effectiveness of the use of additives 
must be demonstrated.
The determining of the value aDIN for IBC high precision angular 
contact ball bearings and IBC high precision cylindrical roller 
bearings by graph and by calculation is summarised on the

5.3 IBC-specific factors
159
For options that exceed the expanded life time calculation ac-
cording to DIN ISO 281, IBC has defined further factors that lead 
to a different life time and that may be taken into account option-
ally. These factors are assumed under “material-related factors” 
alb and awk.
The factor atr recognises the positive characteristics of the 
ATCoat coating if the coating is applied to the raceways. (This 
type of coating may also be applied solely to the outer diameter 
in order to eliminate fretting corrosion to the rolling bearing);  
see Chapter 9 (Materials).
The factor awk makes reference to the material of the rolling 
elements and takes into account the considerably longer life time 
of ceramic rolling elements; there are several reasons for this.

When using rolling bearings that have been thermally treated to 
a higher degree, all components used must be matched to the 
continuous operation temperature.
The IBC-specific factors enter into the calculation of the expanded 
life time in multiplicative form:
In addition, the life time of the grease should be compared to the 
calculated life time of the high precision rolling bearings in order 
to ascertain if permanent lubrication is an option, or in order to 
develop a strategy for continuous or cyclical re-lubrication.

6. Speed Coefficients
161

---

Under defined conditions, the maximum obtainable operating 
speed depends on a number of different factors. Most of these 
factors are numerically known within certain tolerances. For new 
applications, however, they must be determined and/or opti-
mised with the help of tests.
The maximum attainable operating speed is achieved with a 
single bearing that is slightly preloaded with springs, has a load 
of P ≤ 0.06 · C and has good heat dissipation.
The operating speed is based on the basic speed rating n for  
a single high precision rolling bearing that is specified in the 
 respective part of the table. The maximum attainable operating 
speed is calculated by multiplying the basic speed rating speci-
fied in the bearing tables with the speed coefficients mentioned 
below. 
Basic speed rating
This parameter is to be taken from the bearing tables, depending 
on the type of lubricant (grease or oil).
Speed coefficient for preload and arrangement
Reduced limiting speeds apply to high precision rolling bearings 
that are set against each other in an arrangement; these limiting 
speeds may be determined with the aid of the speed coefficients 
contained in the following table.
The following speed coefficients apply to balanced IBC high 
precision angular contact ball bearing sets:
Vertical shaft arrangement
For vertically arranged shafts, the values mentioned in the table 
above must be additionally multiplied by factor 0.8, because of 
the unfavourable lubrication condition and the altered cage guid-
ance.
Load-dependent speed coefficient
The operating speed must be reduced for higher equivalent bear-
ing loads. Diagram 6.1 is used to determine the load-dependent 
speed coefficient.
Cage coefficient
As standard, high precision angular contact ball bearings and 
high precision cylindrical roller bearings are fitted with cages that 
allow for the highest rotational speeds. Alternative cage materi-
als may limit the attainable speed. Please consult our technical 
service teams to find a solution to your special bearing require-
ments.
Speed coefficient of lubricant
If a grease filling quantity is used that deviates from the standard 
quantity, and if greases with an especially high or low viscosity 
are used, this will result in modified factors for the grease lubri-
cation’s basic speed rating.
The grease quantities for the standard greasing that is carried 
out in the factory are specified in table 7.2 in Chapter 7 (Lubrica-
tion) with reference to each bearing type.
The speed coefficients for the various greases are also specified 
in Chapter 7 (Lubrication), in this case in table 7.1.

Speed coefficient of ATCoat coating
Depending on the combination of coated and/or uncoated rings, 
marked with the designation A11, A15, A21 and A31 (see  
designation systems), the following coefficients may be taken 
into account:
An adapted grease distribution run will take account of the sig-
nificantly altered rolling motion conditions prevalent in ATCoat 
coated rolling bearing rings.
Kinematic rolling coefficient
The basic speed rating of high precision rolling bearings to be 
found in the tables applies to the rotating inner ring with a kine-
matic rolling coefficient of 1; for a rotating outer ring the kine- 
matic rolling coefficient is 0.6.
Optimised spring preload
The centrifugal force acting on the rolling elements influences 
the contact angle of the inner and the outer ring in different 
ways. Whereas the centrifugal force tries to pull the rolling ele-
ments into the centre of the raceway with reference to the outer 
ring, and thereby tries to reduce the contact angle, the rolling 
elements simultaneously rise towards the shoulder of the inner 
ring and thereby widen the contact angle. The result is a bore-
rolling effect that encourages wear. An adapted spring preload 
may be used to counteract the rising up of the rolling elements at 
the inner ring.
The dependencies that are used to calculate the ideal spring 
preload are determined by means of the following formula:

Only very seldom can the preload of a mounted spindle be 
adjusted later on. Therefore a compromise needs to be achieved 
in determining the preload, with the aim of guaranteeing opera-
tional safety for a variety of speed ranges.

7. Lubrication
166
The choice of the right lubricant has a very great impact on the 
operational safety of precision bearings, because lubricants 
reduce friction and wear. The majority of rolling bearings that do 
not reach their scheduled life time fail because of faulty lubrica-
tion.
The following influential factors need to be taken into account:
■ rotational speed
■ service temperature range 
■ fatigue
■ the load ratio C/P
■  the minimum required viscosity ν1 with reference 
to the mean bearing diameter
■ the lubricant condition κ
■ EP additives
■ water resistance
■ corrosion protection
■ noise generation
IBC has a wide range of high-quality greases in stock that are 
suited to the various kinds of requirements. High precision rolling 
bearings that are ready-greased during manufacture can be 
ordered from IBC by specifying the relevant suffix. For such high 
precision rolling bearings, the only thing the customer needs to 
do is to carry out the grease distribution run.
Should you require any of these greases for service or pre-
assembly, you can order them from IBC in tubes or tins, or in 
even bigger containers, with the aid of the following order sys-
tem:
GH76-400 
400 g tube of grease GH76
GH62-1000  
1 kg tin of grease GH62

Grease lubrication for rolling bearings
Grease lubrication is the easiest and therefore the most cost-
efficient form of lubrication. It is used for the majority of all rolling 
bearings. Lithium soap greases with mineral basic oil that are of 
comparatively high viscosity are predominantly used for standard 
deep groove ball bearings. For high-speed applications, on the 
other hand, special greases are used, because the synthetic oils 
and special thickening agents they contain allow for much higher 
speed coefficients, not least because of their lower viscosity. The 
greases with the designation GS, or GH for higher temperatures, 
are especially suitable for high precision rolling bearing applica-
tions.

Grease quantity
The quantity of grease used in a rolling bearing depends on the 
speed coefficient dm · n, the grease running-in time, the grease 
service life and possibly also on additional protection being used 
against external contamination in the case of slow-running rolling 
bearings.
The speed requirements for machine tool spindles have been on 
the increase in many areas over the past few years. Thus, the 
quantity of grease has been adjusted and reduced in order to 
take account of this development, and the grease distribution run 
may therefore be shortened, running until a deposit of grease 
has formed on the sides of the raceways
The improved lubricant quantities also have a positive influence 
on the flexibility in operation of the bearing. The IBC standard 
grease quantity is designed to meet these requirements.
Apart from the absolute quantity of grease, the right pre-treat-
ment of the high precision rolling bearing and the insertion of the 
lubricant in the right place are especially important for the lubri-
cating process. It is essential, therefore, to take the following 
considerations into account:
It is better to distribute the quantity of grease evenly by means  
of a syringe, for instance, than to insert the grease with a spatula. 
In the case of cages guided on the outer ring, important places 
for greasing are the contact surfaces between the cage and the 
outer ring of the bearing; other important places are the raceway 
area and especially the gaps in the rolling element cage. 
If requirements for service speed are low, which means limited 
flexibility is required of the bearing, a significantly higher quantity 
of grease may be used than the standard quantity. Conversely, 
the grease quantity should be significantly reduced for very high 
speed coefficients. In extreme cases this can lead to the free 
bearing space receiving a 10% lubrication fill.
Diagram 7.1 shows the increase factor for the grease quantity 
compared to the 25% standard grease quantity that is used for 
IBC high precision angular contact ball bearings. The factor 
ranges from full lubrication for very low speeds to minimum 
lubrication for very high speeds. IBC high precision cylindrical 
roller bearings have a default grease quantity of 10%, which 
means that the factor given in diagram 7.1 cannot be applied to 
cylindrical roller bearings.
A further reduction in lubricant quantity may be achieved with  
the help of dispersion lubrication. This kind of lubrication entails 
dipping the high precision rolling bearing in an emulsion of sol-
vent with 3–5% grease; the inner ring is turned against the outer 
ring, and then the bearing is dried. This procedure ensures that 
all parts of the high precision rolling bearing are coated in lubri-
cant. Dispersion lubrication may also be used as a basis for 
subsequent normal lubrication.

Grease distribution run
A grease distribution run should be carried out before bringing 
high precision rolling bearings into service; if possible this run-
ning-in should include temperature monitoring.
Different scenarios for the grease distribution run have been 
proven and tested; they do, however, depend on the test stand 
used. In high precision rolling bearings that are firmly preloaded 
against each other, the preload may accidentally and signifi-
cantly increase during the grease distribution run due to thermal 
expansion of the inner ring. During the first few minutes of the 
running-in process, or after restarting with a cold spindle, the inner 
ring will heat considerably faster and therefore expand more than 
the outer ring. For a short period of time, the preload will therefore 
increase, sometimes to an extreme degree, until temperature 
balance is regained via heat transfer to the outer ring.
This effect is especially critical for bearings in an X-arrangement. 
It also applies to hybrid bearings, because although their ceramic 
rolling elements have a smaller coefficient of expansion, they 
also have reduced thermal conductivity and higher stiffness. 
Spring preloaded bearing arrangements place slightly fewer 
demands on the grease distribution run. Due to the axial flex-
ibility of the spring adjustment, they are able to compensate for 
the deformation of the inner ring.
Provided that a fixed speed is used, the heat generated may be 
controlled via the ratio of duty cycles to rest periods, whereby 
the former are extended by degrees and the latter shortened, 
until steady temperature conditions exist for continuous opera-
tion. During this process, cooling phases should always be intro-
duced as soon as the maximum temperature of 60-70 °C is 
reached. There will come a point at which the temperature 
steadies, as soon as the excess grease has been displaced from 
the raceway, but it will then slowly start to fall. The schedule to 
be found in diagram 7.2 is well established in practice.

Grease life time
Grease life time or grease service life depends on a number of 
parameters; it may approximately be calculated according to 
standard DIN 51825 in the following way:

The grease life time may be extracted from the lubricant data 
sheet that the manufacturer in question supplies.
First of all, the factor kf · n · dm is calculated for this process. 
Above the resulting value, and at the level of the graph for the 
relevant operating temperature, the grease life time is then read 
off from the diagram below.
The grease life time is a theoretical value that is subject to further 
influencing factors; these factors may further limit the service life 
of the grease.

Re-lubrication
In most cases, for-life grease lubrication is the option of choice. 
If multiple reduction factors limit grease life time, however, provi-
sion must be made for the option of re-lubricating the high preci-
sion rolling bearing.
A suitably short re-lubricating period must apply in very adverse 
lubrication conditions. If this is not feasible, the high precision 
rolling bearings must be replaced in the context of planned main-
tenance, taking into account the above mentioned factors.
In some cases, automatic re-lubricating systems may be used, 
that continuously dispense minimal and fixed amounts of grease. 
High precision angular contact ball bearings with a lubrication 
facility in the outer ring (S) may also be suitable for this proce-
dure. In certain cases, the lubrication holes must be adjusted to 
suit the viscosity of the grease.
In the case of fast-running rolling bearings, higher temperatures 
should be anticipated directly after re-lubricating. Depending on 
the method of insertion, the newly inserted lubricant first needs 
to be displaced from the contact area of the rolling elements to 
the raceways. If necessary, a new grease distribution run may 
have to be carried out.
Oil/air lubrication
This lubrication system is used to increase speed and opera-
tional safety. A minimum quantity of oil is mixed in a fixed ratio 
with compressed air in an oil/air lubrication unit; this mixture is 
then finely metered and fed to the bearing as per unit of time.
The oil/air jet lubrication for high precision rolling bearings with 
cages guided on the outer ring is carried out between the cage 
and the inner ring at the injection diameter Dpi via a small nozzle 
that is either directed in parallel into the gap or is slightly tilted 
towards the inner ring. The latter method additionally helps to 
cool the inner ring – the component that is most exposed to 
heat.
For each oil jet lubrication ring a nozzle measuring 1 mm to  
1.5 mm in diameter and roughly five times the length of the bore 
diameter is recommended.
High precision rolling bearings that are lubricated via the outer 
ring present an alternative to this system. In this case, the outer 
ring of the bearing possesses a radially circumferential supply 
groove that is surrounded by two O-rings for sealing and at least 
one supply hole. These high precision rolling bearings are identi-
fied by an S after the contact angle designation.
The oil/air mixture, which is fed into the bearing in great quantity, 
must be able to escape from the rolling bearing, because oil 
residues can lead to overheating. In order to prevent stagnant oil 
from forming, discharge channels of an appropriate size must be 
provided for. If necessary, the oil/air mixture may be extracted by 
suction (vacuum).
Before bringing into service a spindle lubricated by an oil/air 
mixture, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that during start-up 
the rolling bearing is lubricated by a minimum quantity of oil 
introduced in the course of the mounting process.
Among the lubricating oils that are suitable are alloyed and non-
alloyed mineral oils according to standard DIN 51501 and syn-
thetic oils that have a high degree of cleanliness and contain 
oxidation inhibitors and foam inhibitors.
The reference viscosity according to diagram 5.1 in Chapter 5 
(Life time calculation) gives an approximate specification of the 
required viscosity. But because spindles are often used with a 
wide range of rotational speeds, many applications will require a 
compromise. A viscosity of about 7 mm²/s is necessary for spin-
dles used with the maximum speed; spindles used within the 
medium speed range require a viscosity of about 17 mm²/s.
Oils with a viscosity of < 13 mm²/s should contain EP additives 
that increase the pressure absorption capacity. If an oil/air lubri-
cation system is used, oil viscosity will have little influence on 
heating because of the smaller quantity of oil that is involved.
This permits the use of a higher viscosity ratio of κ > 3 and 
therefore of viscosities of 32–80 mm²/s at 40 °C, that will help  
to increase life time.

---

Oil jet lubrication
Oil jet lubrication is an even safer and an even more complex 
process. For this type of lubrication, a large amount of oil is 
supplied, about 100 times the quantity that is used in the oil/air 
lubrication system. In oil jet lubrication the oil simultaneously 
serves to dissipate heat. The high churning losses that ensue 
when this type of lubrication is used must be balanced by a 
higher driving torque.
For further temperature reduction an interconnected oil recooling 
system may be used.
For horizontal spindles, the jet velocity of the oil must amount to 
one quarter of the circumferential velocity of the air vortex that 
builds up. This velocity is needed so that the oil can break 
through the vortex. In the case of vertical spindles, however, the 
application of this type of lubrication is fraught with problems.
With the aid of oil jet lubrication, even higher speed coefficients 
of over 3 · 106 mm/min can be attained with a minimal rise in 
temperature. The oils used for this type of lubrication have very 
low viscosity (about 3 mm²/s at operating temperature).
The complex system of oil/air lubrication is used to achieve very 
high rotational speeds. If the stress to the rolling bearing is not too 
high, high precision angular contact ball bearings with smaller 
diameter rolling elements or rolling elements made of ceramics 
may also be used. With such rolling elements, even grease lubrica-
tion will yield significantly higher speeds when compared to angu-
lar contact ball bearings that have larger steel rolling elements.

8. Mounting of high precision rolling bearings
176
Preparing the mounting area
IBC High precision rolling bearings for high precision spindles 
are manufactured with the greatest care under ultra-clean condi-
tions; they are subjected to intensive tests and are then packed 
in quality packaging in order to prevent transport damage and 
contamination.
A clean and dust-free working environment should also be en-
sured during mounting so as to be able to achieve the best pos-
sible running performance. Should fine dust or ultra-fine chip-
pings penetrate the bearing, both the precision and the life time 
of the high precision rolling bearing will be adversely affected. 
Abrasive dust is especially aggressive and must be kept away by 
all means. It is advisable to wholly or partially cover the bearing 
place with protective foil if a break in the mounting process oc-
curs or if mounting is very time-consuming. Under no circum-
stances should the bearing be touched with a fluffy cloth. The 
high precision rolling bearings should also be stored in their 
original packaging and should be kept safe from moisture or 
aggressive media.
High precision rolling bearings should generally be kept and 
stored in a horizontal and not in a vertical position and should be 
fully supported.
Mounting high precision rolling bearings with unsuitable or un-
clean tools or mounting aids will considerably affect the working 
of the high precision rolling bearings and will reduce their capa-
bility and life time.
We would like to expressly draw your attention to the fact that 
IBC will assume no liability for damage that is the result of the 
mounting instructions not being observed and not being com-
plied with. This also applies to the faulty interpretation or dis-
semination of the instructions as well as to faulty mounting and 
maintenance.
Because there are so many different possibilities of mounting a 
rolling bearing we are unable to treat all options here, especially 
as such options are also very much specific to the design of the 
adjacent construction. The following remarks therefore make use 
of the fact that in most applications the high precision rolling 
bearing is first mounted on the shaft and the outer ring of the 
bearing fitted afterwards.
Preparing the adjacent parts
Apart from checking for dimension and form accuracy, testing of 
the adjacent parts (housings and shafts) should also include a 
check for surface roughness of the bearing seats. In the case of 
tapered seats, the roundness, the taper angle and the straight-
ness of the tapered surface outline should be checked too.
If spacer rings or precision locknuts have been used, these 
should be checked to see if they run in parallel and are free of 
burrs and damage. Only faultless mounting parts guarantee the 
proper functioning of the high precision rolling bearing. If serial 
mounting is carried out for applications in the upper speed 
range, it is sensible to divide the tolerances of the housings and 
shafts into two or three groups. This will make allocating them to 
bearing sortings easier, a process that helps to achieve interfer-
ence and clearance fits that are as identical as possible during 
mounting.
Detailed information on the sortings of IBC high precision rolling 
bearings are contained in Chapter 4 (Tolerances).
Preparing the high precision rolling bearings
The high precision rolling bearings must be carefully checked 
before mounting. During this inspection the drawing details need 
to be compared to the bearing data on the packaging and/or the 
shrink-wrap foil.
It is most important to prevent dust particles from entering the 
bearing. A dust-free mounting environment should therefore be 
ensured, and the protective foil should only be unsealed just 
before mounting the high precision rolling bearings. It is advis-
able to wear protective gloves when removing the high precision 
rolling bearings from the shrink-wrap foil, as hand perspiration 
may cause corrosion.
High precision rolling bearings are available in the following 
three executions:
■   open, only preserved
■    open, greased and identified by the respective suffix 
(e.g. GS34)
■   sealed, greased and with non-contact sealing

---

177
If lubrication of the high precision rolling bearings with grease is 
carried out by the customer, the customer should ensure the 
grease is compatible with the preservation oil that has been 
applied. If this is not the case, the bearing needs to be rinsed 
and then drained. Under no circumstances should a high preci-
sion rolling bearing be dried with compressed air. Suitable deter-
gents may be used for rinsing. When using detergents, please 
observe the instructions for use supplied by the detergent manu-
facturer as well as the statutory provisions for occupational 
health and safety and environmental protection.
It should be noted that the choice of grease is of fundamental 
importance for the working of a high precision rolling bearing with 
respect to life time, noise level, operating temperature and rota-
tional speed function. After making your choice, lubricate the bear-
ing with the right quantity of suitable bearing grease, while taking 
into account the free space available and the intended speed.
Information on the right amount of grease suited to each rolling 
bearing is contained in the grease quantity table 7.2 in Chapter 7 
(Lubrication).
During insertion of the grease, particular attention must be paid to 
greasing the space between the outer ring shoulder and the cage 
(friction surface). This can be done with a syringe, for instance.
During lubrication, the high precision rolling bearing must be 
revolved several times so as to distribute the grease as evenly 
as possible. This will help to shorten the grease distribution run 
that is carried out afterwards.
You should preserve the remaining bearing surfaces with the 
grease base oil or with preserving agents that are compatible to 
the base oil.
Oil lubrication must be used if the limits of the operating condi-
tions for grease lubrication have been exceeded. In order to 
prevent a potentially detrimental dry start-up in the case of oil-
lubricated high precision rolling bearings, it is essential to apply 
a quantity of the selected oil directly into the high precision roll-
ing bearing before mounting and operation.
Mounting in the right arrangement
In preparation for mounting, the bearing arrangement must be 
checked against the drawing, and the bearing sets must be 
arranged accordingly. Because of their unsymmetrical design, 
angular contact ball bearings may only be loaded in one axial 
direction. Strict attention must therefore be paid to their direction 
while mounting angular contact ball bearings or sets of angular 
contact ball bearings.
In the case of open high precision rolling bearings (see page 8), 
one outer shoulder has been ground clear for assembly. External 
loading is via the shoulder that has not been ground clear. An 
arrow on the outer diameter of the outer ring additionally identi-
fies the load direction, just as in the case of sealed bearings.
IBC high precision rolling bearings are in general universally 
ground. They may be put together in any arrangement during 
mounting.
In addition to having individual arrow indicators, those sets of 
high precision rolling bearings that have been put together in our 
factory in a particular arrangement are marked with a continuous 
(large) V-marking that spans all the high precision rolling bear-
ings in the set. These sets must be mounted exactly in the direc-
tion of the large V-makring and may not be split up. The point of 
the V-marking designates the mounting direction and the main 
load direction.

178
This also applies to high precision rolling bearings that have 
been put together to form high precision rolling bearing sets that 
are balanced with regard to their preload. The possible arrange-
ments for high precision rolling bearings are described in Chap-
ter 2.7 (IBC High precision angular contact ball bearing sets).
Sets of high precision rolling bearings that have been put to-
gether in our factory with no particular arrangement are identified 
by the suffixes DU, TU or QU. These sets are packed together, 
and each bearing carries only an individual arrow indicator on 
the outer diameter of the outer ring.
All high precision rolling bearings match each other with regard 
to their tolerances for bore diameter and outer diameter. This 
means that they feature the same sorting, i.e., they fall in the 
same tolerance zone for bore and outer diameter. Detailed infor-
mation on this process is contained in Chapter 4.3 (Sorting and 
chamfer dimensions IBC high precision rolling bearings).
All high precision angular contact ball bearings with the toler-
ances P4A, P2H and P2A are identified by the explicit specifica-
tion of the mean values Dgm and dgm on the external packaging 
and the foil bag. The bearings are sorted into 2 or 3 groups 
within the allowed tolerance for bore diameter and outer dia-
meter. This makes it easy to put together bearing sets with the 
same load bearing characteristics.
Specifying the tolerance of high precision rolling bearings, and 
taking into account the known tolerances of shafts and housings, 
enables the user to put together combinations within a series of 
spindles that each have the same overlap of tolerance zones.
Mounting process
Induction heating of the high precision rolling bearing or heating 
via heated spacer rings is advisable for inner rings that have 
interference fits. The inner rings are  expanded by this process, 
which makes mounting easier. If you carry out the heating with 
induction heating appliances, only the metal rolling bearing com-
ponents will be heated, whereas the cage and the seals will 
remain thermally unaffected.
It is absolutely essential to make sure the temperature of high 
precision rolling bearings that are to be mounted in a heated 
state does not exceed 80 °C.
When mounting high precision angular contact ball bearings, the 
displacement force should be brought to bear directly on the ring 
which is currently to be mounted by means of a suitable tool; the 
displacement force should not be brought to bear indirectly via 
the counter ring and therefore via the intermediate rolling ele-
ments. Loading the rolling elements with mounting forces should 
generally be avoided. Start with the ring that has the tightest fit.
When fitting the bearing rings you should ensure that these are 
fitted tightly to the contact surface in order to avoid settling and 
misalignment. Such occurrences would lead to premature failure, 
because the bearings would be operating without preload. If high 
precision rolling bearings have been fitted to the shoulder in a 
heated state, the bearing rings must be pushed axially against 
the shoulder once again after they have been allowed to cool.
Preloading the high precision rolling bearings/ 
tightening torques
Preloading of high precision rolling bearings may be carried out 
with IBC precision locknuts, with a flange cover that has multiple 
screws on the pitch circle diameter, or with a central cap screw 
in the middle of a solid shaft.
Preloading with precision locknuts
If you are preloading high precision rolling bearings with a secur-
able precision locknut with fine thread via the inner rings, the 
minimum required tightening torque MD that is needed to over-
come the preload may be determined as follows:
The actual tightening torque is additionally increased by mount-
ing forces due to the effective interference that exists between 
the bearing rings and the shaft; the quality of the thread and of 
the affected surfaces have an influence here too. The maximum 
permissible axial force for high precision rolling bearing rings 
should be taken into consideration during the process; it may not 
exceed a lateral contact pressure of about 10 MPa or 10 N/mm² 
in the area of the raceways, otherwise the  raceways may be-
come deformed and the precision locknut may be damaged by 
excessively high mounting forces. A reduction in mounting forces 
may be realised if a suitable temperature difference is estab-
lished between the high precision rolling bearing and the shaft 
and/or housing.

The following table provides feasible values for the required 
tightening torque that are meant to serve as a guide:
In order to avoid the occurrence of settling, it is advisable first to 
tighten precision locknuts or cap screws with double the tighten-
ing torque, then to unfasten the nuts or screws, and finally to 
retighten them at the target torque.
Further information on precision locknuts with radial or axial 
locking and information on how to more precisely calculate  
the tightening torque is contained in our separate publication 
Precision Locknuts TI-I-5020.
Preloading with flange covers
Clamping the outer rings of the precision rolling bearing to the 
front side is usually carried out with flange covers that have 
several screws. With regard to locating bearings, this cover 
clamps the outer rings of the bearing against a collar in the 
housing.
Above all in the case of high precision rolling bearings that have 
a small cross section and belong to production series 718 and 
719 (N 19), it may happen that a high, and particularly a one-
sided tightening of the screws results in an uneven deformation 
of the bearing outer ring, as shown in figure 8.3. This may lead 
to increased radial or axial runout in certain places. Using many 
small screws is therefore preferable to using only a few large 
screws. Tightening the screws in an even, controlled and gradual 
manner will then achieve the desired result.

The projection of the cover in relation to the housing (preload 
gap) should be reduced in the following way to avoid individual 
cap screws exerting an excessively high clamping force in cer-
tain places:
■ Bearings with d < 100 mm: 0.02 + / - 0.01 mm
■ Bearings with d > 100 mm: 0.03 + / - 0.01 mm
When changing rolling bearings, the flange cover or the spacer 
rings should be readjusted to match the width of the newly in-
serted rolling bearings. With regard to floating bearings you 
should make sure that there is no contact with a housing cover, 
because the cover would restrict the axial expansion of the spin-
dle.
Mounting high precision rolling bearings  
with tapered bore
IBC high precision cylindrical roller bearings with tapered bore 
are slid directly on to the tapered part of the shaft. This process 
expands the inner ring of the high precision cylindrical roller 
bearing and reduces its bearing clearance δr. The endplay is 
further reduced by the fact that the outer ring is also mounted 
with a tight fit in the housing.
The bearing clearance is carefully adjusted during the mounting 
process of the high precision cylindrical roller bearings so as to 
achieve flawless functioning with the highest possible system 
accuracy and the longest possible life time.
A lockable precision locknut is used to provide the axial pressure 
necessary for the adjusting process. The correct axial position of 
the bearing inner ring is ensured by a sleeve that is ground to 
measure and is fitted to the shaft between the inner ring of the 
bearing and the bearing collar.
Determining the sleeve width A requires accurate measuring; the 
individual steps must also be carried out very meticulously. In 
principle, there are two different approaches that need to be 
taken into consideration:
■   The inner ring is slid on to the taper. During this process, 
the  enveloping diameter over the roller and/or the raceway 
diameter is constantly measured until, taking into account 
the restriction of the outer ring and the way it reduces the 
bearing clearance, the total remaining bearing clearance 
corresponds to the required measurement. The remaining 
axial gap between inner ring and bearing collar then has to be 
measured with great accuracy, e.g. by feeling one’s way with 
block gauges as shown in figure 8.5. Following this process, 
the inner ring is released from the tapered seat; a sleeve is 
ground to the dimension measured and is inserted. Then the 
assembly of the bearing is completed.
■   Carrying out this process in multiple steps is more elaborate 
and also more conservative. As in the example above, the inner 
ring is first slid on to the tapered seat on its own, but is not fitted 
very tightly. The gap between the inner ring of the bearing and 
the shaft bearing-collar is then measured and the sleeve is 
made to measure. The enveloping diameter over the roller and/
or the raceway diameter are then measured at the mounted 
inner ring that is clamped against the sleeve. The sleeve is now 
ground narrower step by step, and the inner ring is remounted 
after each step. After each step the measurements are recorded 
and further procedure is decided upon. This approach allows for 
a high degree of control and reduces subsequent settling.
The multiple-step procedure is described below. The individual 
steps are numbered from 1 to n; this is represented in the 
indexing. Values without index number apply regardless of 
the relevant step number and do not change during the entire 
mounting procedure.
Setting the radial clearance or preload δr
Cylindrical roller bearings with tapered bore are fitted either with 
clearance, without clearance or with preload during mounting, 
depending on the bearing requirements. Different maximum 
speeds can be attained for each mounting situation; these are 
listed in table 8.2.

The exact clearance setting is carried out in several steps. First, 
the interference fit on the outer ring is determined.

With ΔG, the restriction of the outer ring is calculated with regard 
to its mounting.

In the first step of the mounting procedure, the inner ring of the 
high precision cylindrical roller bearing is slid on to the tapered 
part of the shaft; the result should be a tight but still easily re-
leasable fit. You should then check if the front side of the ring is 
parallel to the contact surface and/or at right angles with the 
shaft axis. The distance A between the bearing ring and the 
contact surface must be accurately measured.

While sliding on the inner ring, the radial clearance is reduced by 
a ratio of 1:12, which also applies to the change in width of the 
spacer sleeve (Fk = 12). However, if the shaft is hollow it will 
yield elastically, and the proportionality factor Fk will increase.
The values mentioned serve as an indicator for a ΔT up to 5 K 
between inner and outer ring. If fitting is carried out for applica-
tions that have high temperature fluctuations, please contact our 
technical service teams.
182
In the next step, the outer ring of the bearing is mounted by 
applying very low mounting forces and constantly revolving the 
ring so as to avoid tilting and the occurrence of scraping marks. 
In this mounting situation, the existing bearing clearance δr,1 is 
then measured. For this measuring process, a dial indicator 
gauge is affixed to the shaft, and the outer ring of the bearing is 
moved in the measuring direction of the gauge.
Subtracting the calculated restriction of the outer ring of the 
bearing ΔG from the measured radial clearance δr,1 results in the 
provisional radial clearance δvr,1 if the rolling bearing were fully 
fitted in the housing.
The actual attainable radial clearance δr,n is achieved by grinding 
a spacer sleeve to the nominal dimension An in the last process 
step n; this dimension guarantees the exact distance to the 
contact surface of the shaft and parallelism between the contact 
surface and the inner ring of the bearing. In order accurately to

achieve the required radial clearance δr and/or the required 
preload, this procedure must be carried out in several steps  
(1, 2, …, n), because the nominal dimension An cannot be deter-
mined with adequate accuracy in the first step. The width of the 
spacer sleeve is recalculated in each subsequent step. The 
restriction of the shaft is also accounted for during this process, 
taking into account the hollow shaft ratio.

The following effectively applies to the new dimension of the 
spacer sleeve width:
The spacer sleeve ground to the dimension An is then refitted, 
and the inner ring of the high precision cylindrical roller bearing 
is clamped against it so as to force-fit the sleeve. In this condi-
tion, the radial clearance δr,2 is measured.
The measured radial clearance δr,2 must also be corrected for 
the restriction of the outer ring of the bearing in accordance with 
equation 8.4; this results in δvr,2.
This procedure is conservative, and several steps are needed to 
attain the required bearing clearance or the required preload. It 
helps to record each provisional mounting bearing clearance δvr 
in relation to the associated spacer sleeve width A in the form of 
a graph.
This graph will then show the step-by-step approximation to the 
required bearing clearance; alternatively, it will depict the ten-
dency to achieve the preload if, shortly before reaching the re-
quired preload, no more bearing clearance can be measured.

Bearing material 100Cr6
Bearing rings and bearing rolling elements are manufactured 
from vacuum degassed, fine-grained bearing steel 100Cr6 
(1.3505). The characteristics of the steel are as follows:
Heat treatment
The bearing rings made from 100Cr6 are dimension-stable up to 
a service temperature of 150 °C as standard. For higher tempera-
tures, higher-quality heat treatment is available upon request, 
provided all the components are designed for these higher oper-
ating temperatures.
ChromoTec
IBC high precision rolling bearings from the ChromoTec series 
with the prefix X have the full load carrying capacity but a very 
much higher resistance to corrosion.
Silicon nitride Si3N4
The unique combination of extreme hardness, high mechanical 
strength, resistance to corrosion and abrasion, low thermal and 
electric conductivity and a low specific weight make silicon ni-
tride the ideal material for use in rolling bearings. In addition, 
silicon nitride has a lower adhesion compared to steel and there-
fore puts less strain on the lubricant.
Even if there is initial stage and progressive damage to a rolling 
element, the ceramic material will in most cases retain its rolling 
stability.

Cage characteristics and features
Bearing cages have a whole range of functions to fulfil in a roll-
ing bearing:
■  They keep the rolling elements at a distance, prevent them 
from touching each other and thereby reduce friction and 
resulting heat.
■  They ensure that the rolling elements are evenly distributed; 
this guarantees quiet running.
■  They guide the rolling elements in the unloaded area of a 
rolling bearing; this improves the rolling conditions, which in 
turn prevents detrimental slipping from occurring.
Chemical effects also have to be taken into account. The lubri-
cant and its additives, ageing products that result from lubricant 
and additives as well as solvents and cooling agents put a strain 
on the cage materials. That is why widely differing cage materi-
als are available.
Materials for bearing cages
Many cage variations are available, depending on the type of 
rolling bearing and its size. If bearings are used with high operat-
ing temperatures or in problematic operating conditions the use 
of an alternative type of cage is advisable. Please contact us if 
you need a special cage for your application.
The first two cage options mentioned below are the best suited 
for use in machine tools. Due to their special characteristics, 
they cover a broad range of applications.
Fabric reinforced phenolic resin (T)
The low specific weight of this material, a low friction coefficient 
and its high strength make it suitable for the highest speeds with 
very low heat generation. The maximum operating temperature 
is limited to a permanent operation temperature of 100 °C.
Polyamide (P)
Polyamide is also used in a fibre-glass reinforced state and 
combines low weight with good absorption and good sliding 
properties. This variant is characterised by a shortened running-
in time for grease lubrication.
Brass (M)
Solid cages made of brass are very durable and operate reliably 
under the most difficult conditions. They are suited to rolling 
bearings with a higher heat stabilisation that are used with high 
temperatures.
PPS (Polyphenylene sulfide) (PY)
Cages made of PPS are resistant to most acidic, alkaline and 
organic solutions. They have a higher strength, toughness and 
fatigue strength than traditional polyamide cage-materials. They 
are temperature resistant up to 220 °C.
PEEK (Polyether ether ketone) (K)
This material in a fibre-glass reinforced state is suited to operat-
ing temperatures of up to 200 °C. If the temperature range is 
limited to 150 °C, very high rotational speeds are attainable.
High-grade steel (S)
The outstanding characteristic of this material is its chemical 
resistance. High-grade steel cages are suited to rolling bearings 
with a higher heat stabilisation too.
PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) (G)
This synthetic material is chemically and thermally highly resist-
ant and has a very small friction coefficient. This cage material is 
not suitable for the highest speeds, however. Thermal endurance 
reaches 250 °C.
Synthetic material cages made of fibre-glass reinforced polya-
mide PA6.6 are suitable for operating temperatures between  
–20 °C and +120 °C; it should be noted that the lubricant used 
has a strong impact on service life. If you are planning to use 
synthetic lubricating greases and oils with EP additives the 
chemical resistance of the cage material should be checked in 
advance. In conditions accompanied by higher temperatures, the 
life time of a synthetic cage may also be reduced if aged oils are 
used or if the additives in the oil have aged. Oil change periods 
should therefore be strictly adhered to. Rolling bearings should 
not be used with a polyamide cage if they operate near ammonia 
or Freon acting as cooling agents.

Materials for seals
Sealed high precision angular contact ball bearings have the 
advantage of being both very reliable and safe. The seal protects 
the rolling bearing from contamination and thereby extends both 
the life time of the lubricant and the overall system.
Various materials are used, depending on the operating condi-
tions. The standard material acrylonitrile butadiene caoutchouc 
(NBR) has absolutely proved its worth in practice. This material 
has a very good resistance to the following media:
■  most mineral oils and lubricating greases based on mineral oils;
■ regular-grade petrol, diesel fuel and light fuel oil;
■ animal and vegetable oils and fats;
■  water, as well as emulsions of water and the above mentioned 
media.
The application temperature range lies between –40 °C and 
+100 °C. Higher temperatures of up to 120 °C may be realised 
for short periods.
For applications that have special requirements with regard 
to the material of the seal, please contact our department for 
technical applications. We have used seals made from various 
alternative materials in the past, e.g. fluoroelastomers (FKM), 
polyacrylates (ACM) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).

Rolling bearings coated with ATCoat
The material surface of a rolling bearing is becoming more and 
more important to the overall performance of machines, power 
units and equipment. However, outside influences very often 
alter the surface quality of materials or corrode the surface mate-
rial. A whole range of advantages is achieved by coating the 
material surface of a rolling bearing.
An ATCoat thin dense chromium coating protects the surface 
from outside environmental conditions and thereby increases the 
service life of rolling bearings and the life time of machines and 
equipment. The advantages of this coating also include energy 
saving and an efficient use of material. The ATCoat process 
permits the combination of a tough basic material with a firmly 
adhering, very thin and accurate chromium coat that is free of 
cracks. This is why, compared to bearings of the same size, 
those with an ATCoat coating offer very good resistance to wear 
and corrosion.
Rolling bearings coated with ATCoat are an alternative to rolling 
bearings made of corrosion resistant steel. A similar corrosion 
performance is achieved, especially with regard to the functional 
surfaces. The coating layer of 2–4 µm has a cone-shaped sur-
face texture and gives an especially good performance in ex-
treme conditions. Especially if used in combination with ceramic 
rolling elements, ATCoat coating permits a significant increase in 
speed at lower operating temperatures. Fretting corrosion that 
may form on floating bearings, a phenomenon that occurs due to 
the micro displacement of the outer rings of the bearing during 
thermal expansion or vibration, is also avoided. In many cases 
this leads to a significantly longer and trouble-free operating of 
units. Because of the special surface topography, the emergency 
run properties of the bearings are substantially improved. Should 
the lubrication system fail for instance, the units are still able to 
run under part load for a certain period of time; they can also be 
shut down properly. This means that secondary damage can be 
limited or avoided altogether. IBC high precision rolling bearings 
with ATCoat coating are therefore often used in unfavourable 
lubrication conditions.
Such unfavourable conditions exist for example:
■  if lubrication is impossible in a certain environment;
■  if lubrication may only be effected with low-viscosity media that 
do not produce a separative lubrication film;
■  if very low rotational speeds occur that do not allow an elasto-
hydrodynamic lubrication film to develop;
■  if oscillating movements without achieving a full revolution, 
and a separative lubrication film cannot be maintained at the 
reversal points;
■  if sliding occurs in unloaded rolling bearings;
■  if, during fast accelerations or decelerations, smearing occurs 
when bearing rolling elements slide due to the force of con-
tinuance that is caused by mass inertia in conjunction with an 
inadequate preload.

Functions of the ATCoat coating
■  reduction of friction
■  better adhesive strength of the lubrication film
■  separation of materials of the same type
■  reduction of cold welding caused by adhesion
■  reduction of the formation of fretting corrosion
■  the sliding properties of a rolling bearing ring with regard to the 
shaft or the housing are ensured (important for floating bearings)
■  outward corrosion protection and extensive chemical resistance to 
aggressive materials or tribooxidation
■  wear protection due to increased hardness of the coating: 
72–78 HRC (1300–1400 HV)

All rolling bearings produce noise during operation. This signal 
may be accessible and may be monitored, or it may be recorded 
by technical measuring systems and can then be analysed, 
depending on the installation situation.
An increase in noise level may be the sign of a bearing defect in 
the making. A more detailed evaluation is carried out by analys-
ing the impact excitation frequencies. These can then be as-
signed to specific parts of the rolling bearing if the speed and the 
bearing geometry are accurately known.
The frequencies can be calculated according to equations 11.1 
to 11.4 if there is a revolving inner ring. The table below contains 
an example of how this is done.
The frequency spectrum of the rolling bearing sound itself is a 
continuous sound frequency spectrum, with more or less distinct 
spectral lines. This sound frequency spectrum is analysed with 
the aid of an envelope analysis which differentiates between the 
audible sound frequencies of the bearing and the actual impact 
excitation frequencies. If the frequency spectrum of the envelope 
shows prominent intensities of impact excitation frequencies,  
this indicates that a rolling bearing defect has occurred (see  
table 11.2).

damage to rolling 
element
RRF
radial
Impact excitation from damaged rolling elements occurs  
together with their rotational frequency. The cage rotational 
frequency is also noticeable at the edge. Harmonics also  
occur to a high degree.
damage to cage
RRF, CRF
radial, axial
A damaged cage only seldom leads to an unambiguous signal. 
Frequencies occurring are often variable. RRF may occur  
out of alignment.
damage to rings
RPFO, RPFI
radial
Depending on the location and the position of the damage, 
RPFO or RPFI may be more or less clearly identified.  
A developing signal intensity is often distinguishable over time.  
A migrating of the damage to the rolling elements may be  
observed on the basis of RRF.
lubrication
various
radial, axial
Faulty lubrication can lead to a high-frequency, wide-band  
and comparatively strong signal. Re-lubricating will reduce  
the signal. Monitor the signal strength of the bearing for a  
renewed increase.
unbalance of rotor
n / 60
radial
The rotational frequency of the rotor is clearly distinguishable  
in the signal. It is a distinctive point of reference in the  
frequency spectrum.
misalignment
n / 60, n / 120
radial, axial
A signal due to misalignment occurs for full or half passing  
frequency, this is however not very meaningful for determining 
the defect. A different kind of inspection is therefore required.
excessive clearance
n  / 120
radial, axial
An increased signal occurs for half rotational frequency but  
also often for full rotational frequency. The signal is not very 
characteristic, however. An additional inspection of the bearing 
with regard to clearance is required.
