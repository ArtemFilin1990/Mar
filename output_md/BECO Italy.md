Suggest:
We suggest the application of this bearing in any standard application in witch the
temperature is in the range from 90° to 130° C. In this range the standard bearing
have normally problem due to the leakage of the grease, our bearing instead can
be used without problem.

Technical Characteristics:
The life of the Bearing depend from the following operating characteristics:
A continuous temperature of 400°F (200°C) is within its safe range.
It can withstand 550°F (288°C) continuously, provided the bearing
is replenished every 30 minutes with normal quantities of grease.
Occasional temperature spikes to 600°F (315°C) can be sustained
for 5 to 10 minute periods without melting or carbonizing.
Only a check of the temperature of work.

TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Matrix® EP is highly recommended for difficult applications such as
extreme pressure, water, heat, or chemical attack.
The thickener system in Matrix® EP has a protective effect similar
to that of molybdenum disulfide, protecting equipment from wear
under difficult conditions of extreme load.
Matrix® EP helps neutralize acids and also resists reacting with
caustic materials. Matrix® EP grease has prevented corrosion
despite years of exposure to phosphoric acid.
Matrix® EP 1 can be pumped in central lubrication systems at
temperatures down to 23°F (-10°C).
Matrix® EP 2 is suitable for use in Caterpillar equipment under the
category of "Water and Temperafure Resistant Grease".
The TK grades are designed for slow moving bearings under the
most extreme load. These grades are also more tacky and more
resistant to water.

BENEFITS:
•   LONG LIFE - reduced relubrication frequency.
•   WATER RESISTANT - does not deteriorate when water
    (including treated water) enters the body of the grease.
•   WIDE SPEED RANGE - recommended for use in electric
     motor bearings as well as slow moving bearings and
    bushings.
APPLICATIONS:
Water / chemicals: Phosphate processing, suction and wet end
rolls on paper machines, outdoor cranes and ship lifts, boat trailer
wheel bearings and other marine applications.
Highly Loaded Equipment: Pellet mills, shaker screens, belt
conveyor pulleys, slewing bearings, centrifuges, hammer mills,
sealed work roll bearings, fan bearings and many others.
High Temperature Applications: Tenter frame bearings (plastic and
textile industries), oven conveyor bearings, plastic extruder
bearings, rotary unions on roto- molders.
Because the tendency to bleed oil is very low, Matrix® EP grease is
highly recommended for mechanical couplings and single point
automatic lubricators.
Matrix® EP is suitable for wheel bearings, chassis and U-joints on
all vehicles including trucks, construction and mining equipment.

DET 900 EP 2 is a stable, nonflammable, chemically inert grease designed for use in
long life and sealed- for- life applications.
It is inert to virtually all chemicals used in industry, is insoluble in most solvents,
and relatively stable to radiation when compared to conventional lubricants.
This product is biologically inert and offers superior resistance to
"Lewis acids," found in semiconductor manufacturing.
DET 900 EP 2 will prove serviceable for long periods at continuous temperatures up to 400°F (204°C)
with minimal re- lubrication. DET 900 EP 2 can withstand higher temperatures (up to 575°F or 300°C).
At 575°F re- lubrication is needed approximately every 8 to 12 hours.
Ensure adequate ventilation when used at or above 535°F (280°C)
Compatibility with elastomeric seal materials and plastics is
excellent. This includes Buna N, Butyl 325, Neoprene, Nylon and
Teflon. The limiting factor when using this grease is the thermal
stability of the elastomer or plastic.

Grease Benefits:
•   LOW EVAPORATION - compared to conventional synthetic
    greases, an increase in lubricant ife of 5 to 10 times can be
    achieved.
•    CHEMICAL RESISTANCE - provides protection against most
     aggressive chemicals that degrade conventional lubricants.
•   NONFLAMMABLE AND INERT - depending on the specific
    chemicals involved, this grease can be considered for use in
    facilities that manufacture corrosive chemicals. Consult
    Technical Services Department before using.
•   PAINT COMPATIBLE - since it is silicone-free, 
    DET 900 EP 2 is suitable for use in high temperature paint
    oven bearings,
•   WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE - can be used up to 575°F
    (300°C) with adequate re-lubrication and ventilation.
•   ANTI-CORROSION - does not contain chlorine and will not
    promote chloride-induced corrosion.
APPLICATIONS:
Designed for use in any grease-lubricated applications where high
temperatures, chemicals, or radiation create difficulties or where
long lubricant life is required.
Typical applications include bearings on hot air blowers, bearings
on oven conveyors, and fan bearings on textile machines. Suitable
for use in film stretching machines and will not react with plastic film.
Suitable for use in systems that handle aliphatic, aromatic, or
chlorinated hydrocarbons, gasoline, ketone, alcohol, ethers, or
water.
Partially soluble in trichlorotrifluoroethane.
