Permanent magnet motors for variable
speed applications
DriveIT low voltage permanent magnet motors are 
synchronous motors, designed to drive low speed ap-
plications directly, without a gearbox. Ideal applications 
are paper machines, low speed pumps, extruders etc. 
The motors are designed exclusively for frequency 
converter supply. ABB’s frequency converters from 
the ACS 600, ACS 800 and ACS 6000 series are 
available with permanent magnet motor software. 
The ABB Direct Drive system offers several valuable 
beneﬁ ts:
•    Higher overall efﬁ ciency of a drive system
• Excellent controllability and adjustability, even  

without a pulse encoder. For instance, no pulse  

encoder is needed with paper machine drives
• Fewer components means: less maintenance and  

less down-time
• Easier and faster installation
• Space savings
ABB's permanent magnet motors are based on the 
well-known and reliable M3BP and HXR motor de-
sign.  The greatest difference is the modern rotor 
construction, where the squirrel cage or magnetisation 
windings have been replaced by highly efﬁ cient per-
manent magnets. This means that the major beneﬁ ts 
of squirrel cage and synchronous motors are com-
bined to one product, called M3BJ, M3LJ or AMZ.

Application characteristics 
• Constant torque or quadratic torque applications are  

the most ideal. Constant power speed range should  

ideally be limited to 20 % over nominal speed.
P [kW] x 9550
    load r/min

*) T [Nm]  = 
In the case of motor and gearbox solution:
-  P is the power of the existing motor power 
-  ’load r/min’ is the speed in r/min of the output shaft  

of the gear box
Example:
Motor 160 kW, max. motor speed 1500 r/min. Gearbox 
with i = 5
Gearbox output speed (= load speed) = 1500 / 5 = 300 
r/min

T =                      = 5093 Nm
See 'Motor characteristics section 4. Motor selection 
example'.
160 x 9550
      300
Technically, the permanent magnet motor could be 
used in any application up to about 850 r/min. How-
ever, not all applications may be economic.  
Permanent magnet motor solution can typically 
replace:
• A traditional AC motor and gearbox with frequency  

converter.
• A traditional low speed AC motor, typically 10 to 16- 

pole or slower with frequency converter.
• A DC motor with DC drive and gearbox.
The permanent magnet motor is ideal in the follow-
ing cases:
• Where the application is speed controlled, for in- 

stance with a frequency converter.
• Where the nominal load speed, for example the 

gearbox output speed, is 100 to 850 r/min or ide- 

ally 300 to 600 r/min.
• Where the nominal load torque is between 1000  

and 50 000 Nm *).
• Where the required short-time overloadability is  

limited to 120 - 150 %.
• The greatest savings are achieved if the current  

speed reduction system is expensive or otherwise  

problematic.

ABB/ LV Motors/ Cat. BU/ Permanent Magnet Motors GB 05-2004
The rotor magnetization is achieved by the permanent 
magnets installed inside the rotor. This means the 
amount of magnetizing current drawn from the supply 
network is minimal. For this reason, the power factor 
of these motors is considerably higher compared to 
squirrel cage motors with the same nominal speeds. In 
practice, this means smaller frequency converters and 
supply units.  
1. Loadability
Motors with separate cooling (IC 416) or liquid cool-
ing can deliver full torque continuously at any speed 
between zero and nominal speed (nn). The continuous 
output torque of self-cooled (IC 411) motors must be 
derated according to the applicable speed range. Note 
that the nominal torque of a self-cooled (IC 411) motor 
is not equal to the nominal torque of the same motor 
with separate cooling (IC 416). Derating factors can be 
found in Figure 1. Above nominal speed all motors can 
deliver constant power (CP) up to 1.2 times nn. 
This catalogue includes all available M3BJ and M3LJ 
type motors. A greater speed and output range is avail-
able in the AMZ series of motors.  The types listed 
in this catalogue represent the torque range for each 
frame size.                     
2. Speed Range
Generally the speed range of these motors is from zero 
to 1.2 times the nominal speed. The voltage, which is 
induced by the permanent magnets to the stator wind-
ings, is proportional to the rotational speed. At speeds 
higher than 1.2 times nn, the voltage may be too high for 
the insulation of the motor and the supply system, as 
well as for the frequency converter. In some cases the 
Motor characteristics
maximum speed is limited to nn. The maximum speed 
for the motors at different voltage levels is listed for 
each motor in the technical data section. If higher speed 
is needed, please contact ABB.  
3. Overloadability
The permanent magnet motors have limited short-
time overloadability, especially with the IC 416 and 
liquid cooled versions. The Tmax/TN values in the techni-
cal tables represent the available overloadability with 
frequency converter supply.  Necessary margins are 
already included. There is no need to add any margins 
to this value. This value does not represent the pull-out 
torque value according to IEC standards.

4. Motor selection
Motor selection step-by-step:     

1. Find the correct section based on network voltage.

2. Select between self cooled, IC 411 and forced venti- 

lated, IC 416 (or liquid) cooled data tables. A motor  

with forced ventilation, IC 416 is usually the most  

economical solution.

3. Select the base speed. The most economical solu- 

tion is achieved by selecting a motor with lowest  

base speed. Note however the maximum speed  

given for each motor type.

4. Generally, the motor can be selected based on  

torque when the base speed of the load is below  

the motors base speed. If motors base speed is  

below loads base speed, the motor selection is  

based on power. In any case make sure that the  

motor has enough torque throughout the speed  

range.

Example
Network voltage: 500 V
Load: Constant torque 8000 Nm, 100-400 r/min, 335 kW
at 400 r/min
Cooling: IC 416 cooling
In the 500 V section there are 375 r/min and 433 r/min
motor base speeds.
In the case of the 375 r/min motor base speed, the 
motor's base speed is below the base speed of the load
and the motor selection is based on power as the motor
is working on the “constant power” range. The M3BJ
400LC / 3GBJ406530-ADG183706 motor can deliver
366 kW between 375 r/min and 450 r/min and 9309 Nm
between 0-375 r/min. It meets the application require-
ments.
In the case of 433 r/min base speed, the motor’s base 
speed is above the load’s base speed and the motor 
selection is based on torque as the motor is working on 
its constant torque range throughout the load’s speed
range. The M3BJ 400LC / 3GBJ406530-ADG183708
can deliver 8906 Nm between 0 - 433 r/min. Also this
motor meets the application requirements.
However the 375 r/min motor needs less current as it 
has reached the ﬁ eld weakening point and full inverter 
output voltage. This minimizes the inverter size and
optimizes the drive system economically.
The permanent magnet motors will be included in the
DriveSize program during 2004. The software will in-
clude all M3BJ, M3LJ and AMZ type motors.

5. Insulation protection
The 280 to 400 size motors are equipped with rein-
forced insulation as standard, thus dU/dt-ﬁ lter is needed 
only above 600 V.
The 500 to 560 size motor are made with form wound
windings with Micadur® Compact Industry Insulation
system (class F). It has a sufﬁ cient insulation level for
a IGBT converter even without output chokes or dU/dt 
ﬁ lters. For more information, please see the brochure
'Micadur® Compact Industry, Insulation System for Ro-
tating Electrical Machines' (code 3BFP 001 980 R0101 
REV B 06/2003).
6. Bearing currents
Bearing voltages and currents must be avoided in all
motors. When using ABB IGBT frequency converters 
properly dimensioned ﬁ lters at the converter output
must be used according to the instructions in ﬁ gure
2. (For other alternatives and converter types, please
contact ABB) 
When ordering, clearly state the alternative to be used.
All motors listed in this catalogue have insulated bear-
ings or bearing systems at the non-drive end as stan-
dard. 
For more information about bearing currents and volt-
ages, please consult ABB document 3GZF500930-8 or
contact ABB.
Figure 2. Selection rules for insulation and ﬁ ltering for permanent magnet motors
dU/dt ﬁ lter
These ﬁ lters are series reactors, which decrease the rate of change of the phase and main voltages and thus reduce voltages and reduce voltage 
stress in the windings. dU/dt ﬁ lters also decrease common mode currents and the risk of bearing currents. They are designed to limit the dU/dt 
rate of the main voltage at motor terminals to approx. 1 kV/µs.
Common mode ﬁ lters
Common mode ﬁ lters consist of toroidal cores installed around motor cables or onto the busbars inside frequency converter. These ﬁ lters
reduce common mode currents in VSD applications and thus decrease the risk of bearing currents. Common mode ﬁ lters do not signiﬁ cantly
affect thephase or main voltages on motor terminals. For more information and product codes, please contact ABB.

7. Cabling, grounding and EMC
The use of a frequency converter causes some further
requirements to the cabling and grounding of the drive 
system. The motor must be cabled by using shielded
symmetrical cables and cable glands providing 360° 
bonding (also called EMC-glands). 
For motors frame size IEC 280 and upward, additional
potential equalization between the motor frame and the
machinery is needed, unless they are installed on a
common steel fundament. When a steel fundament is 
used equalize potential, the high frequency conductivity
of this connection should be checked.To fulﬁ ll the EMC
requirements, special EMC cable(s) must be used in ad-
dition to the correct cable gland mounting, with special, 
additional grounding pieces.
More information about grounding and cabling of a 
variable speed drive can be found from the manual
'Grounding and cabling of the drive system' (Code: 
3AFY 61201998 R0125 REV A).
8. Reverse power
Magnetic ﬂ ux is present in the motor at all times due to 
the permanent magnets in the rotor. The motor gener-
ates voltage if rotated. Motor rotation must be prevented 
before opening the terminal box. If there is a possibility
that the motor may be rotated when the supply sys-
tem is cut off, it is recommended that there is a proper 
switch disconnecting the motor from the supply system 
to ensure safe working.

ABB’s industrial drive for permanent 
magnet motors
DriveIT Low Voltage AC Drives are used to control 
the speed and torque of a standard induction mo-
tor. Now with ACS 800 series single drives and mul-
tidrives it is possible to control the ABB permanent 
magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) as well.

ACS 800 PMSM control application program pro-
vides the same excellent Direct Torque Control 
(DTC) performance and control accuracy devel-
oped by ABB making speed encoders and/or ro-
tor position measurement unnecessary.

One of the main beneﬁ ts of the ACS 800 series is a 
wide range of drive products with common technolo-
gies. This includes e.g. compact design, DTC, common 
user and process interfaces, ﬂ exible and program-
mable I/Os, software tools for sizing, commissioning 
and maintenance as well as common spare parts.

Main beneﬁ ts of the ACS 800 PMSM control are the 
ability to start a permanent magnet motor encoderless 
with estimated rotor position and to produce full torque 
within 200 ms after the start command. Also very accu-
rate torque linearity can be achieved down to 2 % of the 
nominal speed of the PM motor.  

Safety, feasibility and dimensioning considerations:                     
• Rotating PM motor generates Back-EMF voltage,  

thus a separate protective device must be used, e.g.  

a safety switch by the motor.
• Field weakening is very limited. In case of an active  

load, the intermediate circuit must be protected  

against over speed/over voltage.
• AC drive needs to be over dimensioned by 10 % of  

the nominal motor current.
To select the correct drive please refer to the cor-
responding ABB industrial drive catalogue and use 
the DriveSize dimensioning tool.
• ACS 800 Catalogue for single drive 
• ACS 800 Technical catalogue for multidrive

tion program.

Bearing life
The nominal life L10h of a bearing is deﬁ ned according 
to ISO as the number of operating hours achieved or 
exceeded by 90% of identical bearings in a large test 
series under certain speciﬁ ed conditions. 50% of the te-
sted bearings achieve at least ﬁ ve times the L10h life. The 
values in the table are calculated without any external 
forces on motor bearings.
Lubrication
Permanent magnet motors have grease valve lubrica-
tion for lubrication in service. The lubrication intervals 
and grease quantity are stated in the maintenance 
instructions, which are delivered with the motor. If a  
motor is equipped with a lubrication instruction plate, 
the instructions on the plate should followed.

On delivery the motors are lubricated with Esso   
Unirex S2 grease, which is the recommended grease 
type. The maintenance instructions include other com-
patible grease types.
Pulley diameter
When the desired bearing life has been deter-
mined, the minimum permissible pulley diam-
eter can be calculated using FR, as follows:
     D = 1.9 · 107 · K · P
                  n · FR
where:
D = diameter of pulley, mm
P = power requirement, kW 
n  = motor speed, r/min
K = belt tension factor, dependent on belt type

and type of duty. A common value for

V-belts is 2.5.
FR = permissible radial force

ABB/ LV Motors/ Cat. BU/ Permanent Magnet Motors GB 05-2004
Permissible loadings on the shaft end
The table below gives the permissible radial force at 
shaft end (FXmax)  in Newton, assuming zero axial force. 
The values are based on 40,000 hours bearing life on 
normal conditions for motor sizes 280 to 400. For motor 
sizes 500 and 560 values are based on 30,000 hours 
bearing life.
Motors are foot-mounted IM B3 version with the force 
directed radially. In some cases, the strength of the 
shaft affects  the permissible forces.
Permissible loads of simultaneous radial and axial forces 
will be supplied on request.
