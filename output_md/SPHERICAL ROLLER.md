Spherical Roller Bearings
Design and configuration
Spherical Roller Bearings are particularly suitable 
for applications where misalignment can arise from 
error in mounting or from shaft deflection.
NACHI Spherical Roller Bearings are manufac-
tured in a number of design and material configu-
rations depending on the type of application and 
size of the bearing.
See the table below for the roller, guide ring and 
cage design for NACHI Spherical Roller Bearings.
They can sustain radial and axial loads.
Attention
(1) For high axial load applicadtions, the axial load 
Fa must not exceed 0.6 of the radial load Fr. If the 
axial load exceeds 0.6 Fr, please contact NACHI
engineers for design assistance.
(2) For applications where oscillating loads (such 
as shaker screen applications) or high speed is 
involved, please contact NACHI for design assis-
tance.
(3) In very lightly loaded or no load conditions, 
sliding motion can occur which could damage the 
bearing.
To prevent this damage, bearings must be 
subjected to a load greater than 0.02 Cr (basic 
dynamic load rating). 
(4) The material coefficient number of the 
bearing is taken into consideration for the dynamic 
load rating.
* This only applies to spherical roller bearing.

Lubrication holes and groove
The outer ring of Spherical Roller Bearings are 
often made with lubrication holes and a groove for 
feeding lubricant. The outer ring may also be 
configured with oil holes only depending on fitting, 
mounting or service conditions.
Heat-stabilized bearings
NACHI Spherical Roller Bearings are subjected to 
a heat-stabilization treatment as standard.
They can be used at operating temperature of up to 
200˚C with minimal dimensional changes occur-

Misalignment
Maximum permissible misalignment angle is about 
2˚ under general service conditions.
But its angle will vary with the series, service 
condition and surrounding structure.
As rotational speed increases, misaligned bearings 
will tend to generate more noise.
Due to noise constraints, the practical maximum 
misalignment in a bearing may be considerably 
less than the maximum permissible misalignment.
Mounting bearings with tapered bore
Mounting bearings with  a tapered bore requires 
some experience and technique.
Bearings with tapered bore are always mounted 
with an interference fit on the shaft.
To measure the amount of interference fit on the 
shaft, the axial displacement of the inner ring or 
the reduction of radial internal clearance due to the 
interference fit can be used. Generally, the 
measurement of reduction in radial internal clear-
ance is a more reliable method than measurement 
of the axial displacement of the inner ring.
Note: (1) The values are applied for mounting on solid shaft. In case of hollow shaft, larger axial displacement should be applied.

(2) In following cases, please make sure radial internal clearance after mounting.

  - Initial radial clearance is in the lower half of the tolerance range.

  - Large temperature difference exists between inner ring and outer ring in operation.

Internal clearance after mounting must be equal to or over these values.

Spherical Roller Thrust Bearings
Aligning angle
Maximum permissible misalignment angle is about 
2˚ under general service conditions. If the aligning 
advantages of this bearing type are to be realized, 
care must be taken to provide clearance for parts 
in the surrounding structure.
Safety-factor
The safety-factor "So" must be over 4.
Minimum axial load
To prevent damage caused by sliding motion 
between the rollers and raceway, spherical roller 
thrust bearings must be subjected to a load more 
than the minimum load, Fa min.
Lubrication
Because there are many sliding surfaces in E type 
Spherical Roller Thrust Bearings (cage-to-guide-
sleeve and roller-ends-to-rib),oil lubricant (not 
grease) should be applied.
