1. Bearing Types and Features
7. Mounting is made easier because press
fitting can be performed with an arbor press
or the like.
8. Lubricating the bearing is easy and a
lubrication hole can also be provided upon
request.
9. If a closed type is used at the shaft end,
savings can be made on the housing end
cover.
10. The full complement roller bearing carries
the load on many rollers and thus
maximizes load capacity.
11. Among full complement roller bearings,
bearings whose rollers are held in place by
grease before assembly have the maximum
load capacity because the rollers have the
longest possible length.
12. The cage of the needle bearing accurately
guides the rollers at the pitch diameter of
the rollers.  The surface of the cage is
hardened to reduce frictional torque and
increase rigidity and wear resistance.
13. The unique structure of the cage allows
extensive space for storing lubricant, thus
enabling smooth lubricant circulation and
increasing grease life.
Needle roller bearings are a type of roller
bearings and are classified as either radial or
thrust depending on the direction of the load
they support.  Needle roller bearings include
bearings whose rollers slightly exceed the size
range of needle rollers as stipulated by ISO.
Needle roller bearings include drawn cup
and solid radial bearings, as well as
application-specific cam followers, roller
followers.  Thrust bearings include thrust needle
bearings.  Although not classified as a rolling
bearing, there is also a spherical sliding
bearing that supports radial and axial loads.
This catalog presents the various types of
needle bearings and their features.  For easy
reference, the numbers in each section from
1.1 through 1.0 correspond to the numbers in
Figs. 1.1 through 1.9.
1.1 Cage & Needle Roller Assemblies
1. The cage has a unique structure that
facilitates handling by holding the rollers
securely in place.
2. The outside surface of the cage serves as a
guide face and helps create favorable
lubricating conditions.
3. The cage guides the rollers accurately to
ensure that stable roller movement is
maintained.
4. The single-piece cage has high strength
and rigidity and facilitates the free
circulation of lubricant.
5. High load capacity is possible due to the
presence of many rollers of relatively long
length.
6. To prevent stress concentrations on both
ends of the rollers (edge loads), appropriate
crowning is applied.
1.2 Drawn Cup Needle Roller Bearings
1. NSK drawn cup needle roller bearings are
available in two types: caged and full
complement.  Drawn cup outer rings are
made of carefully selected alloy steel sheet.
They are surface-hardened after precise
pressing, giving them a unique structure.
2. The outer ring is precisely pressed and is in
tight line contact with the rollers.  Optimum
heat treatment gives the raceway surface
uniform strength and the ability to carry
heavy loads.
3. The low height of the bearings saves space
so machines can be made more compact
and lightweight.
4. The bent part of the drawn cup outer ring
securely holds the rollers and/or cage and
acts as a labyrinth seal that prevents both
the entry of dust and dirt and lubricant
leakage.  At the same time, it enhances the
strength of the outer ring end faces.
5. When the shaft has adequate hardness and
is finished to proper dimensional accuracy,
the inner ring can be omitted and space in
the radial direction can be saved.
6. As securing in the axial direction is
achieved by press fitting, a locating snap
ring, collar, housing shoulder or the like is
not required.  This simplifies the housing
structure and facilitates low-cost design.

1.5 Cam Followers and Roller
Followers
1. The thick-walled outer ring made of high-
carbon chromium bearing steel, which is
finished by grinding after hardening, has
high shock resistance and is highly resistant
to deformation.
2. The cam follower has lubrication holes in
three places.  Lubrication can be provided
easily from any of these three locations.
3. Crowning is applied to the rollers in order to
avoid edge loading.
4. The labyrinth seal structure reduces friction.
In addition, a special thrust washer is
integrated in order to enhance heat seizure
resistance.
5. Increasing shock resistance, the shaft of the
cam follower has a hardened raceway
surface.
6. The roller follower can carry heavy loads
because both ends are supported.
1.6 Needle Rollers
There are a variety of end faces available
from which an appropriate shape can be
selected for specific applications.
1. Rounded rollers are the most widely used.
2. Flat rollers have a longer effective load-
carrying length.
3. Crank pin rollers are suitable for where the
corner of the shaft or housing step is
considerably rounded.
4. Appropriate crowning can be applied for
various usage conditions.
NSK NEEDLE BEARING
BEARING TYPES AND FEATURES
A 8
1.3 Solid Needle Roller Bearings
1. The bearing ring can sustain high shock
loads because it is precisely ground after
being heat treated.
2. Providing high load capacity, many rollers
are held in the outer ring by strong
integrated ribs.
3. The unique single-piece cage is also
excellent for high speeds as the cage
accurately guides the rollers at the roller
pitch diameter at both ends of the rollers.
4. Considerable space is allotted for lubricant
and lubricant life is long.
5. The cage is surface treated, increasing
wear resistance and rigidity.
6. Appropriate crowning is applied to the
rollers to avoid edge load.
7. Outer rings provided with a lubrication
groove and lubrication hole facilitate the
replenishment of lubricant.
8. As the size variation per unit of roller
diameter is small, the distribution of the
roller load is favorable and bearing life is
long.
1.4 Thrust Bearings
1.4.1 Thrust Needle Bearings
1. Making compact design feasible, the height
of the cross-section is similar to that of a
conventional thrust washer.
2. The cage, which is made of two steel
sheets precisely pressed, holds and
accurately guides the rollers.  The cage is
surface hardened to increase wear
resistance and rigidity.
3. There are thrust washers of various
thicknesses available to meet the
requirements of different applications.

1.9 Drawn Cup Roller Clutches
There are three types with a clutch only: FC,
FCL and RC; and three types with a clutch and
bearing combined: FCB, RCB and FCBN.
1. The unique structure of the drawn cup outer
ring makes the clutch lightweight and
compact.
2. The height of the cross-section is the same
as standard drawn cup needle bearings
and the torque capacity is high.
3. Performance is accurate and friction torque
is low during overrunning.
4. Installation can be done in the same way as
for drawn cup needle bearings, that is, by
simply press fitting the unit into the housing.

1.7 Spherical Plain Bearings
1. Since the structure is composed simply of
an inner ring with spherical outside and an
outer ring with a spherical bore, this bearing
is ideal for applications where the inner and
outer rings are misaligned.
2. Carefully selected high-carbon chromium
bearing steel is used, and high load
capacity is achieved thanks to ideal
hardening.
3. Bearings with single-cut outer rings are not
separable even without snap rings.
4. Bearings with double-cut outer rings are
assembled by a wire snap ring into a single
body.
5. The lubrication grooves and lubrication
holes provided in the inner and outer rings
facilitate re-lubrication.
6. After phosphate coating, a coating of
molybdenum disulfide is applied to the
whole surface.
1.8 Needle Roller Bearings for
Universal Joints
Needle roller bearings for universal joints
include two types: drawn cup and solid.
1. While the tightening method is mainly used
for securing drawn cup needle bearings in
a yoke hole, another method employs a
rose washer and bearing assembly is
carried out using special equipment.
Universal joints made by assembling drawn
cup needle bearings have the following
characteristics:
(a) It is possible to impose a light preload
between the bearing inner bottom and
cross shaft end.
(b) It is possible to have the cross shaft,s
rotating center aligned with the shaft
center.
(c) Universal joints made in this way are
economical and contribute to making
products more compact and lightweight.
2. As solid needle bearings can sustain
heavier loads than drawn cup needle
bearings, universal joints with solid needle
bearings are suitable for medium and
heavy-duty motor vehicles.

2. Bearing Life and Basic Load Rating
2.3 Life Equation
The following relation exists between the
basic dynamic load rating, the bearing load and
the rating fatigue life of roller bearings:
........................(2.3)
where, L : Rating fatigue life (106-revolution
unit)
P : Bearing load (equivalent load)
(N), {kgf}
Cr, Ca : Basic dynamic load rating of
radial bearing and thrust bearing
(N), {kgf}
When the bearing is rotating at a certain
speed n (min－1), it is convenient to express the
fatigue life of the bearing in hours.  When
fatigue life is expressed in hours, 500 hours is
referred to as standard,
33.3min－1×60min×500h＝106rev
In other words, the basic dynamic load rating
C, which gives a life of 106 revolutions, gives
the life of 500 hours at 33.3min－1
Lh : Fatigue life hours of bearing (h)
....As shown in Fig. 2.2 and Appendix 13
fh : Fatigue life factor
....As shown in Fig. 2.2 and Appendix 13
fn : Speed factor
....As shown in Fig. 2.2 and Appendix 12
With the above, the relation between
equations 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 is obtained.
........................................(2.4)
...................(2.5)
......................................(2.6)
2.1 Bearing Life
Like other rolling bearings, needle roller
bearings cannot be used forever and can
fracture for various reasons.  If bearings are
incorrectly mounted, lubrication is improper or
bearings are exposed to dust and moisture due
to poor sealing, they will eventually fail to
perform satisfactorily.  Even if bearings are
properly mounted and operated correctly with
sufficient lubrication, when rolling bearings are
operated under load, the inner and outer ring
raceways and rolling elements are subjected to
repeated cyclic stress.  Because of metal
fatigue of the rolling contact surfaces of the
raceways and rolling elements, scaly particles
may separate from the bearing material.  This
phenomenon is called “flaking”.  Bearing fatigue
life is defined by the total number of revolutions
after which the bearing surface will start flaking
due to stress.  If the speed is constant, the
fatigue life is often expressed by the total
number of operating hours.  As shown in Fig.
2.1, even for seemingly identical bearings,
which are of the same type, size and material,
and receive the same heat treatment and other
processing, the rolling fatigue life varies greatly
even under identical operating conditions.  This
is because the flaking of materials due to
fatigue is subject to many other variables.
Consequently, “rating fatigue life” is used in
preference to actual rolling fatigue life.
Suppose a number of bearings of the same
type are operated individually under the same
conditions.  After a certain period of time, 10%
of them fail as a result of flaking caused by
rolling fatigue.  The total number of revolutions
at this point is defined as the basic rating life
or, if the speed is constant, the basic rating life
is often expressed by the total number of
operating hours completed.
2.2 Basic Dynamic Load Rating
The basic load rating is defined as the
constant load applied on bearings with
stationary outer rings that the inner rings or
shafts can endure for a rating life of one million
revolutions (106 rev).  The basic load rating of
radial bearings is defined as a central radial
load of constant direction and magnitude, while
the basic load rating of thrust bearings is
defined as an axial load of constant magnitude
in the same direction as the central axis.  The
basic load ratings of roller bearings are defined
in ISO 281 and can be calculated by Equation
2.1 and 2.2.  The basic load ratings Cr and Ca
listed in the dimension tables of NSK needle
bearings are calculated in accordance with
ISO, but amended with development of
bearing materials and manufacturing quality.

improvements in bearing steel.
NSK now uses vacuum degassed bearing
steel, and the results of tests by NSK show that
life is greatly improved when compared with
earlier materials.  The basic load ratings Cr and
Ca listed in the bearing tables were calculated
considering the extended life achieved by
improvements in materials and manufacturing
techniques.  Consequently, when estimating life
using Equation 2.9, it is sufficient to assume
a1 = 1.
The life adjustment factor for operating
conditions, a3, is used to adjust for various
factors, particularly lubrication.  If there is no
misalignment between the inner and outer rings
and the thickness of the lubricating film in the
contact zones of the bearing is sufficient, it is
possible for a3 to be greater than one; however,
a3 is less than one in the following cases:
・When the viscosity of the lubricant in the
contact zones between the raceways and
rolling elements is low.
・When the circumferential speed of the
rolling elements is very slow.
・When the bearing temperature is high.
・When the lubricant is contaminated by
water or foreign matter.
・When misalignment of the inner and outer
rings is excessive.
It is difficult to determine the proper value for
a3 for specific operating conditions because
there are still many unknowns.  Since the special
bearing property factor a2 is also influenced by
the operating conditions, there is a proposal to
combine a2 and a3 into one quantity (a2 ×a3),
and not consider them independently.  In this
case, under normal lubricating and operating
conditions, the product (a2 ×a3) should be
assumed equal to one.  However, if the viscosity
of the lubricant is too low, the value drops to as
low as 0.2.
If there is no misalignment and a lubricant
with high viscosity is used so sufficient fluid-film
thickness is secured, the product of (a2 ×a3)
can be as high as two.
When selecting a bearing based on the basic
load rating, it is best to choose a reliability
factor (a1) appropriate for the projected use and
an empirically determined C/P or fh value
derived from past results for lubrication,
temperature, mounting conditions, etc. in similar
machines.
2.4 Static Load Rating
2.4.1 Static Load Ratings
When subjected to an excessive load or a
strong shock load, rolling bearings may incur a
local permanent deformation of the rolling
elements and permanent deformation of the
rolling elements raceway surface if the elastic
limit is exceeded.  The nonelastic deformation
increases in area and depth as the load
increases, and when the load exceeds a certain
limit, the smooth running of the bearing is
impeded.
The basic static load rating is defined as that
static load which produces the following
calculated contact stress at the center of the
contact area between the rolling element
subjected to the maximum stress and the
raceway surface.
For roller bearings 4 000 MPa{408 kgf/mm2}
In this most heavily stressed contact area, the
sum of the permanent deformation of the rolling
element and that of the raceway is nearly
0.0001 times the rolling element,s diameter.  The
basic static load rating C0 is written C0r for radial
bearings and C0a for thrust bearings in the
bearing tables.
In addition, following the modification of the
criteria for basic static load rating by ISO, the
new C0 values for NSK,s roller bearings became
about 1.5 to 1.9 times the past values.
Consequently, the values of the permissible
static load factor, fs, have also changed, so
please pay attention to this.

BEARING LIFE AND BASIC LOAD RATING

2.3.1 Temperature Adjustment for Basic
Dynamic Load Rating
If rolling bearings are used at high
temperature, the hardness of the bearing steel
decreases.  Consequently, the basic load rating,
which depends on the physical properties of the
material, also decreases.  Therefore, the basic
load rating should be adjusted for higher
temperatures using the following equation.
Ct = ft･C ..............................................(2.7)
where, Ct : Basic load rating after
temperature correction
(N), {kgf}
ft : Temperature factor
(See Table 2.1)
C : Basic load rating before
temperature adjustment
(N), {kgf}
2.3.2 Hardness Factor, fH
The raceway surface should be HRC58 to 64
and hardened to the proper depth.  Methods for
hardening the raceway surface include full
hardening, carburized hardening or induction
hardening.  A decrease in hardness results in a
rapid reduction in the fatigue life of the bearing.
When hardness is lower than HRC58, it is
necessary to correct the basic dynamic load
rating by multiplying it by the hardness factor,
fH, shown in Fig. 2.3.
2.3.3 Correction of Basic Rating Life
As described previously, the equation for
calculating the basic rating life of roller bearings
is:
.........................................(2.8)
The L10 Life is defined as the basic rating life
with a statistical reliability of 90%.  Depending
on the machines in which the bearings are
used, sometimes a reliability higher than 90%
may be required.
However, recent improvements in bearing
material have greatly extended the fatigue life.
In addition, the development of the Elasto-
Hydrodynamic Theory of Lubrication proves that
the thickness of the lubricating film in the
contact zone between rings and rolling
elements greatly influences bearing life.  To
reflect such improvements in the calculation of
fatigue life, the basic rating life is adjusted
using the following adjustment factors:
Lna = a1a2a3 L10......................................(2.9)
where,Lna : Adjusted rating life in which
reliability, material improvements,
lubricating condition, etc. are
considered
L10 : Basic rating life with a reliability
of 90%
a1 : Life adjustment factor for
reliability
a2 : Life adjustment factor for special
bearing properties
a3 : Life adjustment factor for
operating conditions
The life adjustment factor for reliability, a1, is
listed in Table 2.2 for reliabilities higher than
90%.
The life adjustment factor for special bearing
properties, a2, is greater than one because of

3. Bearing Loads
3.1 Equivalent Load
While in some cases the loads applied to
bearings are purely radial or axial loads, in most
cases the loads are a combination of both.  In
addition, loads usually fluctuate in both
magnitude and direction.  For this reason, the
loads actually applied to bearings cannot be
used for bearing life calculations.  A hypothetical
load that has a constant magnitude and passes
through the center of the bearing (and will give
the same bearing life that the bearing would
attain under actual conditions of load and
rotation) should therefore be estimated.  Such a
hypothetical load is called the equivalent load.
In the case of radial needle bearings, as the
only load that can be applied is radial, the
dynamic equivalent load can be obtained from
the following equation:
P = Fr ...................................................(3.1)
where, P : Dynamic equivalent load (N),
{kgf}
Fr : Radial load imposed on bearing
(N), {kgf}
3.2 Calculation of Bearing Loads
The loads applied to bearings generally
include the weight of the body to be supported
by the bearings, the weight of the revolving
elements themselves, the transmission power of
gears and belting and the load produced by the
operation of the machine in which the bearings
are used.  These loads can be theoretically
calculated, but some of them are difficult to
estimate.  Therefore, it becomes necessary to
correct the estimates using empirically derived
data.
3.2.1 Load Factor
When a radial or axial load has been
mathematically calculated, the actual load on
the bearing may be greater than the calculated
load because of vibration and shock present
during operation of the machine.  Actual loads
may be calculated using the following
equations:
Fr = fw・Frc }.........................................(3.2)
Fa = fw・Fac
where, Fr, Fa : Loads applied on bearing (N),
{kgf}
Frc, Fac : Theoretically calculated load
(N), {kgf}
fw : Load factor
The values given in Table 3.1 are usually
used for the load factor, fw
3.2.2 Bearing Loads in Belt or Chain
Transmission Applications
The force acting on the pulley or sprocket
wheel when power is transmitted by a belt or
chain is calculated using the following
equations:
M = 9 550 000H/n .....(N・mm) }.........(3.3)
=
974 000H/n .....{kgf・mm}
Pk = M/r ...............................................(3.4)
where, M : Torque acting on pulley or
sprocket wheel (N・mm),
{kgf・mm}
Pk : Effective force transmitted by belt
or chain (N), {kgf}
H : Power transmitted (kW)
n : Speed (min－1)
r : Effective radius of pulley or
sprocket wheel (mm)
When calculating the load on a pulley shaft,
the belt tension must be included.  Thus, to

2.4.2 Permissible Static Load Factor
The permissible static equivalent load on
bearings varies depending on the basic static
load rating and also the application and
operating conditions.
The permissible static load factor, fs, is a
safety factor that is applied to the basic static
load rating, and it is defined by the ratio in
Equation 2.10.  The generally recommended
values of fs are listed in Table 2.3.  Conforming
to the modification of the static load rating, the
values of fs were revised, especially for
bearings for which the values of C0 were
increased, please keep this in mind when
selecting bearings.

2.5 Maximum Permissible Load of
Drawn Cup Needle Roller
Bearings Pmax
The drawn cup (outer ring) of a needle
bearing is made of a thin-wall special steel
sheet that is hardened by carburizing after
press-forming.  Dynamic loads beyond the
maximum permissible load, Pmax, in the Bearing
Tables should not be imposed.  For static loads,
the permissible load is up to 1.3 times Pmax.

In the case of a chain transmission, the
values corresponding to fb should be 1.25 to
1.5.
3.2.3 Bearing Loads in Gear Transmission
Applications
The loads imposed on gears in gear
transmissions vary according to the type of
gear.  In the simplest case of spur gears, the
load is calculated as follows:
M = 9 550 000H/n.......(N・mm) }.........(3.6)
=
974 000H/n.......{kgf・mm}
Pk = M/r................................................(3.7)
Sk = Pktan θ.........................................(3.8)
Kc = 
..........................(3.9)
where, M : Torque applied to gear
(N・mm), {kgf・mm}
Pk : Tangential force on gear (N),
{kgf}
Sk : Radial force on gear (N), {kgf}
Kc : Combined force imposed on gear
(N), {kgf}
H : Power transmitted (kW)
n : Speed (min－1)
r : Pitch circle radius of drive gear
(mm)
θ: Pressure angle
In addition to the theoretical load calculated
above, vibration and shock (which depend on
how accurately the gear is finished) should be
included by multiplying the theoretically
calculated load by the gear factor, fg.
The values of fg should generally be those in
Table 3.3.  When vibration from other sources
accompanies gear operation, the actual load is
obtained by multiplying the load factor by this
gear factor.
3.3 Average Load
3.3.1 Average of Fluctuating Load
When the load applied to bearings fluctuates,
an average load that will yield the same bearing
life as the fluctuating load should be calculated.
（1）When the relation between load and
rotating speed is divided into the following
steps (Fig. 3.1):
Load F1 : Speed n1; Operating time t1
Load F2 : Speed n2; Operating time t2
Load Fn : Speed nn; Operating time tn
Then, the average load, Fm, may be
calculated using the following equation:

While full complement roller bearings can be
operated at considerably high speeds (see the
limiting speeds shown in the Bearing Tables),
bearings with cages are recommended for high-
speed applications.  Bearings with cages are
also preferable for applications where shaft
deflection or mounting error is relatively high
because their rollers are accurately guided and
crowned.
4.1.2 Comparison between Drawn Cup and
Solid Bearings
Employing a thick, hardened bearing ring,
solid bearings can sustain high shock loads
and continuous loads.  Drawn cup bearings are
not to be used beyond the maximum
permissible load shown in the Bearing Tables.
Although solid bearings of high rigidity can
be used with double-cut, split housings, drawn
cup bearings are affected by bore accuracy
and housing rigidity due to their thin outer ring.
Therefore, double-cut, split housings should be
avoided.
When mounting solid bearings, positioning is
required to be in line with the shoulder of the
housing hole or a snap ring.  However, with
drawn cup bearings, as through-holes are
sufficient for housings, bore processing is easier
and more economical.
4.1 Bearing Types
It is important to select the needle roller
bearing that is most suited to the particular
application.  One must fully understand the
structure and characteristics of a selected
bearing to determine whether it is appropriate
for a given application.
When selecting needle bearings, the
following factors should be considered:
(1) Amount, direction and condition of bearing
load
(2)  Rotating speed and which ring is rotating
(3)  Required bearing life
(4)  Ambient temperature of bearing
(5)  Accuracy of bearings
(6)  Degree of friction
(7)  Noise
(8)  Vertical shaft or horizontal shaft
(9)  Lubricating method and sealing device
(10)  Mounting and dismounting
(11)  Space for mounting
(12)  Finishing accuracy, rigidity, and materials
of shaft and housing
(13)  Cost requirements
Weighing these factors along with the
characteristics of specific bearings, the best
bearing for a particular application can be
selected.
The characteristics of various NSK needle
roller bearings are compared in Table 4.1.
4.1.1 Comparison of Bearings with Cages
and Full Complement Bearings
Comparing bearings of the same size, full
complement bearings, both at rest and when
rotating, have a higher load rating and
maximum permissible load than bearings with
cages, and are therefore preferred for most
applications.
As the rollers are accurately guided in
bearings with a cage and no friction occurs
between the rollers, the friction torque is lower
than in the full complement roller bearings.
Under ideal lubrication conditions and normal
load, approximate friction torque can be
obtained with the following equation.

load, lubricating method, and cooling
conditions, including those of the bearing,s
surroundings.  When bearing load, P, exceeds
8% of the basic load rating, C, the limiting
speed shown in the Bearing Tables must be
corrected by multiplying it by the correction
factor in Fig. 4.1.
In the Bearing Tables, the limiting speeds for
oil lubrication are shown for each bearing.  For
grease lubrication, consider 60 to 70% of the oil
lubrication values as a guide.  Please consult
NSK for further details.
4.4 Internal Clearance of Rolling
Bearings
The internal clearance of rolling bearings
during operation is one of the key features
affecting bearing characteristics such as life
span, heat generation, vibration and noise.
Internal clearance is the space between the
raceway ring and the rolling elements.  The
distance the free ring moves when a specific
measured radial load is applied is defined as
the radial measured clearance.  In roller
bearings, since elastic deformation caused by
the measured load can be ignored, the
measured clearance and geometric clearance
(radial internal clearance) are considered to be
the same.
Values for the radial internal clearance of
metric solid needle bearings with
interchangeable components are listed in Table
4.3.  These are classified from smallest
clearance to largest into C2, CN, C3, C4 and
C5. When the clearance range of bearings with
interchangeable rings is too wide, matched
bearings with the clearances listed in Table 4.4
(page A23) are available.
The radial internal clearances of inch needle
bearings with inner rings, HJ + IR, are shown in
Table 4.5 (page A25).  HJ + IR needle bearings

4.2  Machinery in which Bearings are
Used and Projected Life
It is not advisable to select bearings with
unnecessarily high load ratings, for such
bearings may be too large and uneconomical.
In addition, the bearing life alone should not be
the deciding factor in the selection of bearings.
The strength, rigidity, and design of the shaft on
which the bearings are to be mounted should
also be considered.  Bearings are used in a
wide range of applications and the design life
varies with specific applications and operating
conditions.  Table 4.2 gives empirical fatigue life
factors derived from operating experience for
various applications.
4.3 Limiting Speed
Rolling bearings are subject to speed
limitations.  When bearings are operating, the
higher the speed, the higher the bearing
temperature due to friction.  The limiting speed
is the empirically obtained value for the
maximum speed at which bearings can be
continuously operated without failing from
seizure or generation of excessive heat.
Naturally, limiting speeds (in min－1) vary
depending on such factors as bearing type and
dimensions, cage type and material, bearing

4.4.4 Radial Internal Clearance of Drawn
Cup Needle Roller Bearings
Because the correct form and dimensional
accuracy of drawn cup needle bearings is
achieved only after press fitting into a specific
housing bore, the method for selecting the
internal clearance of solid needle bearings
cannot be applied to drawn cup bearings.
Please refer to page B39 for the internal
clearances of drawn cup needle bearings.
4.5 Bearing Accuracy
NSK needle roller bearings are manufactured
in conformity with the accuracy classes set
down by ISO.  Class 0 is adequate for general
use, while bearings with higher accuracy, such
as Classes 6, 5, and 4, are recommended for
use when extremely low runout is required,
when the rotating speed is high, and/or when
less friction and shaft fluctuation are required.
As various factors, such as bearing type,
internal clearance, lubrication, and mounting,
should be considered when selecting higher-
accuracy bearings, please consult NSK.
As defined by ISO, the boundary dimensions
for radial bearings, tolerances for boundary
dimensions and running accuracy, and limits for
chamfer dimensions are shown in Table 4.7.
Regarding high-accuracy bearings of Class 6
and higher, please consult NSK.

are wide and clearance values are determined
broadly based on previous experience to be on

deformation, is defined as the effective
clearance.  Theoretically, bearing life is longest
when the effective clearance is slightly negative.
It is, however, difficult to operate all bearings
under these ideal conditions and if the proper
negative clearance is exceeded, bearing life
significantly decreases.  The effective clearance,
therefore, should generally be set as positive.
Fitting conditions, temperature conditions and
mounting error should be taken into
consideration in clearance selection.
4.4.1 Fitting Condition
Radial clearance is reduced by expansion or
contraction of the bearing rings when fitting
either an inner or an outer ring onto a shaft or
into a housing with interference.  This decreased
value, obtained by the calculation shown in
Table 5.1 (page A31), is approximately 75 to
90% of interference.
As the fitting surface is finished with a certain
tolerance, it is advisable that calculation of the
decreased value in internal clearance due to
fitting be dealt with statistically.
4.4.2 Bearings and Circumference
Temperature Conditions
Frictional heat generated by bearing rotation
is released through shafts and housings.  Since
heat is released more readily through the
housing, the temperature of the inner ring and
rolling elements is higher than that of the outer
ring.  This difference in temperature is larger
when the shaft is heated or the housing is
cooled.  Radial internal clearance is reduced by
the difference in heat expansion resulting from
the temperature difference between the inner
and outer rings.  The value of this clearance
reduction in rolling bearings is calculated by the
following equation:
...............................(4.1)
where, δt: Decreased value of radial internal
clearance by temperature
difference between inner and
outer ring (mm)
α: Coefficient of linear expansion of
bearing steel (12.5 × 10
－6)
dt: Temperature difference between
inner and outer rings (°C)
D: Nominal outside diameter (mm)
d: Nominal bore diameter (mm)
4.4.3 Shaft Deflection and Mounting Error
of Bearings
When shaft deflection and mounting error are
large, it is necessary to select a larger bearing
clearance.  For metric solid needle bearings, for
example, when the fitting of the inner and outer
rings is tight (i.e., tighter than the values of k
and K) care should be taken to select a
clearance of C3 or CC3 and larger from Tables
4.3 and 4.4, in order to prevent insufficient
radial internal clearance.
For solid needle bearings, which are often
used without an inner ring, various radial
internal clearances are obtained by selecting
shaft tolerances, as shown in Table 4.6.

to be about (0.1 to 0.15) dT in case that the
shaft is cooled.  The decrease in the interference
of the inner ring due to this temperature
difference ddT may be calculated using Equation
5.4:
ddT ＝(0.10 to 0.15) dT・α・d
≒0.0015 dT・d × 10－3 (mm) ......(5.4)
where,ddT: Decrease in interference of inner
ring due to temperature
difference (mm)
dT: Temperature difference between
bearing interior and surrounding
parts (°C)
α: Coefficient of linear expansion of
bearing steel ＝12.5 × 10
－6 (1/°C)
d: Nominal bearing bore diameter
(mm)
In addition, depending on the temperature
difference between the outer ring and housing,
or difference in their coefficients of linear
expansion, the interference may increase.
5.1.5 Deformation and Stress Caused by
Fitting
When mounting a bearing with an
interference fit, deformation and stress of the
rings result.  Calculations of surface pressure,
stress, and expansion and contraction of inner
and outer rings during fitting are the same as
those of a thick cylinder to which is applied
internal or external pressure.  These
calculations are compiled and shown in Table
5.1.  The modulus of longitudinal elasticity and
Poisson,s ratio of shaft and housing are
calculated as the inner and outer rings are the
A 30
5. Shaft and Housing Design
The function of the bearing cannot be
achieved fully without adequate design of the
bearing abutment, even though appropriate
bearings can be selected from a wide range of
bearing types.  In particular, the raceway ring of
needle bearings is very thin compared with
other roller bearings, so special consideration
should be taken regarding shaft and housing
design and fitting.
5.1 Fitting
5.1.1 Purpose of Fitting
The purpose of fitting is to fix an inner ring or
outer ring into the shaft or housing and to
prevent harmful circumferential slipping, which
is called “creep.”  Creep between fitting
surfaces causes wear and results in abrasive
metallic particles entering the bearing, which
leads to abnormal temperature rise and
vibration.  Fitting is also necessary for obtaining
the correct form and dimensional accuracy for
drawn cup needle bearings.
5.1.2 Type and Volume of Load
It is necessary to know which ring, inner or
outer, rotates against the load.  In the case of
an inner ring rotating load, creep occurs when
the fitting between the inner ring and shaft is
not tight enough.  Because creep cannot be
prevented simply by fixing the inner ring axially,
the fitting for the inner ring and shaft needs to
be tight.  However, relatively loose fitting is
often employed to make mounting and
dismounting easier.  In this case, the fitting
surfaces must be well lubricated to prevent
fretting and scoring.
In the case of an outer ring rotating load, the
fitting between the outer ring and housing
should be tight.  For loads of indeterminate
direction, such as unbalanced loads, vibration
loads, and irregular dimensional loads, tight
fitting of both the inner and outer rings is
recommended.
In accordance with the size of the load, the
inner ring is compressed in the radial direction
and becomes relatively wider while interference
decreases. The interference must not, however,
be allowed to disappear due to the radial load.
The decrease in interference, ddF, is estimated
using the following equation:
......(5.1)
where,ddF: Decrease in interference of the
inner ring (mm)
d: Nominal bore diameter (mm)
B: Nominal inner ring width (mm)
Fr: Radial load applied on bearing
(N), {kgf}
5.1.3 Effective Interference and Finish of
Shaft and Housing
Since the roughness of fitted surfaces is
reduced during fitting, the effective interference
becomes less than the apparent interference.
The amount of this interference decrease varies
depending on the roughness of the surfaces
and may be estimated using the following
equations:
For ground shafts
...........................(5.2)
For machined shafts
...........................(5.3)
where, dd: Effective interference (mm)
dda: Apparent interference (mm)
d : Bearing nominal bore diameter
(mm)
According to Equations 5.2 and 5.3, the
effective interference of bearings with a bore
diameter of 30 to 150 mm is about 95% of the
apparent interference.
5.1.4 Interference Variation Caused by
Temperature Difference between
Bearing and Shaft or Housing
The effective interference decreases due to
the increasing bearing temperature during
operation. If the temperature difference between
the bearing and housing is dT (°C), then the
temperature difference between the fitted
surfaces of the shaft and inner ring is estimated

Table 5.1 does not apply to drawn cup
needle bearings.
5.1.6 Recommended Fitting
As discussed above, selecting appropriate
fitting requires knowledge of various conditions
such as the actual volume and type of load
applied to the bearing, temperature conditions,
and other conditions affected by fitting.
However, it is very difficult to obtain accurate
data for all factors involved.  Fitting, therefore, is
often determined based on previous experience
and records.  Standard fittings for needle
bearings are shown in Tables 5.2 and 5.3.
Generally, when mounting a bearing in a thin-
wall housing or on a hollow shaft, tighter fitting
is required.
A split housing cannot be used with drawn
cup needle bearings.  If there are no
alternatives, a bearing press-fitted into a
cylindrical sleeve can be used.  It is
recommended not to use fitting tighter than that
of JS7 (J7) for solid bearings in split housings.
The fitting examples shown in Tables 5.2 and
5.3 (page A33) can be applied to solid shafts
and steel or cast iron thick－wall housings.  For
mounting needle bearings on hollow shafts and
in thin-wall or light metal housings, fitting should
be tighter than the values shown in Tables 5.2
and 5.3.  When higher bearing accuracy is
especially required, it is necessary to enhance
the accuracy of the shafts and housings.
As correct form and dimensional accuracy of
the outer ring of drawn cup needle bearings are
obtained only after press fitting into a specific
housing bore, please refer to page B40 for
fittings for drawn cup needle bearings.
However, for the fittings for the inner ring and
shaft being used for drawn cup needle
bearings, refer to the values in Table 5.2.
Tolerances for shafts and housing bore
diameters are listed in Appendices 9 and 10 at
the end of this volume.

5.3 Materials and Heat Treatment of
Raceway Surface
The raceway rings and rollers of needle
bearings are repeatedly stressed on their
relatively small contact surfaces.  The materials
for raceway rings, rollers and shafts and
housings that function as raceways must
therefore have high hardness, resistance to
permanent deformation and long rolling fatigue
life.  These materials are also required to be
resistant to wear and shock, and have good
dimensional stabilization.  Common materials
used for shafts and housings that function as
bearing raceways include:
High-carbon chromium bearing steel
(for through hardening)
SUJ2 (JIS G 4805)
Carbon steel for machine construction
(for carburizing)
S15CK (JIS G 4051)
Chrome molybdenum steel (for carburizing)
SCM415 to 421 (JIS G 4053)
Chrome steel (for carburizing)
SCr415, 420 (JIS G 4053)
Nickel chrome steel (for carburizing)
SNC415 to 815 (JIS G 4053)
Nickel chrome molybdenum steel
(for carburizin)
SNCM220, 415, 420 (JIS G 4053)
Other materials, such as S50C and S55C,
can be utilized with through hardening or
induction hardening.
The hardened layer, which is tempered at 160
to 180°C after hardening, has to develop a
martensite structure that has an even
distribution of very fine carbides.  In the case of
cemented or induction hardening of the
raceway surface, the surface hardness should
not only be HRC58 to 64 (HRC60 to 64 is
preferable), but also the hardened layers with
Vickers hardness of HV653 (HRC58) and
HV550 (HRC52.3) have to reach appropriate
depths.  When the values of hardness are
below these values, bearing fatigue life
significantly decreases (see page A14).  The
hardened layer depth (up to HV550) after
grinding finish is estimated by using the
following equation:
t ≧(0.08 to 0.10) Dw ............................(5.5)
where,
t : Effective hardened layer depth
(mm)
Dw: Roller diameter (mm)
Core hardness is generally HRC30 to 45.
5.4 Abutment and Fillet Dimensions
The outer ring of solid needle bearings
should be positioned in the axial direction using
the housing shoulder, collar and snap ring.
When mounting, the unmarked side should
touch the housing shoulder.
The radius ra at the rounded fillet of the
housing should be less than the minimum value
of the bearing,s chamfer dimension r.  When
mounting the inner ring on the shaft, the same
consideration should be taken (refer to Table
5.5).

5.2 Accuracy and Roughness
5.2.1 Accuracy and Roughness of Fitting
Surfaces
Since the raceway rings of needle bearings
are extremely thin, the raceway surface is
greatly affected by the accuracy of the shaft
and housing.  For general operating conditions,
a turned finish, smooth bored finish, or reaming
finish is acceptable.  For high accuracy and low
noise under heavy load, however, a grinding
finish is required.
A finish roughness of less than1.6pmRa is
desirable.  As a split housing may deform the
outer ring of a thin-wall needle bearing, care
should be exercised with the bearing,s finish,
such as putting a relief on the machining
surface of the mating parts.  Accuracy and
roughness for machining surfaces are shown in
Table 5.4.
5.2.2 Accuracy and Roughness of the
Raceway Surface
The shaft and housing bore are often used as
raceway surfaces of needle bearings in order to
achieve the most compact bearing design and
enhance shaft rigidity, load capacity and
accuracy.  In this case, accuracy and
roughness of the raceway surface greatly affect
the life, noise and accuracy of bearings.
Therefore, shape, accuracy and roughness have
to be treated with great care.  In particular,
harmful circumferential waviness and a
polygonal shape are not desirable.  Accuracy
and roughness for raceway surfaces are shown
in Table 5.4.  These values may be changed
depending on the desired performance.
5.2.3 Shaft Inclination
Shaft inclination caused by external force
elastic deflection and mounting error should be
less than the values indicated below.  If shaft
inclination exceeds the values in the table,

6. Lubrication and Lubricating Methods
6.1 Friction and Lubrication
Low friction in a bearing means low power
loss and temperature rise, which together
enable machines to achieve higher speeds.
Friction in a machine may vary depending on
bearing type, structure, dimensions, as well as
the finishing accuracy of the rolling and sliding
contact surfaces.  It is also influenced by
operational conditions, such as bearing load,
rotating speed and lubrication.  With light load
and high-speed rotation, lubrication largely
affects the starting torque, while with heavy load
and low rotating speed, the load,s effect
dominates.  Torque converts itself into thermal
energy causing temperature rise in bearings.
The degree of temperature rise is determined
by the difference between the amount of heat
generated and that dissipated.  When bearing
temperature exceeds 120°C, the characteristics
of the bearing,s material are changed and the
lubricating agent is deteriorated.
6.1.1 Purposes of Lubrication
The main purposes of lubrication are to
reduce friction and wear inside bearings that
may cause premature failure.  The effects of
lubrication may be briefly explained as follows:
(1)   Reduction of Friction and Wear
In needle bearings, it is necessary to
lubricate the area where sliding occurs between
the raceway surface and rollers due to roller
skew and elastic deformation during operation
in order to reduce sliding friction and wear
between the cage and rollers, the cage and
guide surface of the rotating ring, and the roller
end face and the ring,s rib face.
(2)   Extension of Fatigue Life
The rolling fatigue life of bearings depends
greatly upon the viscosity and film thickness
between the rolling contact surfaces.  A heavy
film thickness prolongs the fatigue life, but it is
shortened if the viscosity of the oil is too low so
the film thickness is insufficient.
(3)   Dissipation of Frictional Heat and
Cooling
Circulation lubrication may be used to carry
away frictional heat or heat transferred from
overheating and the oil from deteriorating.
(4)   Others
Adequate lubrication also helps to prevent
foreign material from entering the bearings and
guards against corrosion or rusting.
6.2 Lubricants
6.2.1 Lubricating Grease
Grease is a semi-solid lubricant consisting of
a base oil and a thickener.  The main types and
general properties of grease are shown in Table
6.1.  It should be remembered that different
brands of the same type of grease may have
different properties.
(1)   Base Oil
Mineral oils or synthetic oils such as silicone
or diester oil are mainly used as the base oil for
grease.  The lubrication properties of grease
depend mainly on the characteristics of its base
oil.  Therefore, the viscosity of the base oil is just
as important when selecting grease as when
selecting an oil.  Usually, greases made with
low-viscosity base oils are more suitable for
high speeds and low temperatures, while
greases made with high-viscosity base oils are
more suited for high temperatures and heavy
loads. However, as the thickener also influences
the lubricating properties of grease, the
selection criteria for grease are not the same as
for lubricating oil.
(2)   Thickener
Thickeners for lubricating grease include
several types of metallic soaps, inorganic
thickeners such as silica gel and bentonite, and
heat-resistant organic thickeners such as
polyurea and fluoric compounds.  The type of
thickener is closely related to the grease
dropping point ( 1): generally, grease with a high
dropping point also has high-temperature
capability.  This said, grease does not have a
SHAFT AND HOUSING DESIGN
A 36
The shoulder height h should be less than
the width of the side face of the outer ring and
less than the thickness of the inner ring.  It
should also have sufficient surface contact.  The
shaft and housing shoulder need to be finished
with a right angle against the shaft center (Fig.
5.1).
The marked side of drawn cup needle
bearings should be in contact with the mounting
jig, and mounted onto the step-less through
hole.  Drawn cup needle bearings should not
be positioned in the axial direction by either a
snap ring or collar.  The side face of the drawn
cup outer ring has to be 0.25 mm or more
shorter than the housing,s side face in order to
protect the bending part of the outer ring,s side
face (Fig. 5.2).
Other abutment and fillet dimensions are
presented in the introductory section for each
series.  Please refer to the related sections as
required.

A 39
high working temperature unless its base oil is
heat-resistant.  The highest possible working
temperature for grease should be determined
considering the heat resistance of the base oil.
The water resistance of grease depends upon
the type of thickener.  Sodium soap grease or
compound grease containing sodium soap
emulsifies when exposed to water or high
humidity and therefore cannot be used where
moisture is prevalent.
(3)   Additives
Grease often contains various additives such
as antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, and
extreme pressure additives to give it special
properties.  It is recommended that extreme
pressure additives be used in heavy load
applications.  For long use without
replenishment, an antioxidant should be added.
(4)   Consistency
Consistency refers to the “softness” of
grease.  Table 6.2 shows the relation between
consistency and working conditions.
(5)   Mixing Different Types of Grease
In general, different brands of grease must
not be mixed.  Mixing grease with different types
of thickeners may destroy its composition and
physical properties.  Even if the thickeners are of
the same type, possible differences in additives
may cause detrimental effects.
6.2.2 Lubricating Oil
Highly refined mineral or synthetic oil is used
as lubricant for rolling bearings.  The first point
to consider when selecting lubricating oil is
appropriate viscosity.  This varies depending on
the type of needle bearings.  Under regular
operating conditions, lubricating oil with a
viscosity of 13 mm2/s (cSt) or more at the
operating temperature should be selected.  For
thrust bearings, oil with a higher viscosity
should be chosen.  Generally, higher rotational
speeds require lower viscosity and larger loads
and larger bearing sizes require higher
viscosity.
In addition to proper viscosity, characteristics
required of lubricating oil include cleanliness,
resistance to corrosion, high lubrication
performance, superior oxidation resistance,
fluidity at low temperatures and pressure
resistance.  Fig. 6.1 shows the temperature-
viscosity chart for general oil.  The viscosity
change at a given operating temperature, as
well as the appropriate viscosity can be
determined from this curve.  The method for
selecting lubricating oil under various operating
conditions is illustrated in Table 6.3.

6.3 Lubricating Methods
6.3.1 Comparison of Grease Lubrication
and Oil Lubrication
The lubrication methods for rolling bearings
are generally classified into grease lubrication
and oil lubrication.  Grease lubrication can last
from six months to two years before being
replenished.  It is therefore ideal for reducing
maintenance.  However, oil lubrication is
preferred if the design allows because of its
many advantages over grease, including higher
limiting speed, longer lubricant life and better
cooling properties.  Table 6.4 compares grease
and oil lubrication.
6.3.2 Grease Lubrication
With grease lubrication, the internal space in
the housing is required to be only 1.5 times the
bearing,s volume.  Generally, the bearing is fully
packed with grease before mounting and the
amount packed into the housing is 1/4 to 1/3
the volume of the free internal space.  When the
internal space of the housing is less than 1.5
times the bearing,s volume, it is appropriate that
the filling amount for the housing be 1/2 to 2/3
the volume of the free space including the
bearing itself.  Grease should be supplied not
only to the space inside the housing, but to the
inside of the bearing as well.
If too much grease is supplied, churning of
the grease will result and the bearing,s
temperature will rise.  This causes deterioration
and softening of the grease resulting in leakage.
Generally, once grease is packed, refilling isn,t
necessary for a long period of time.  However,
the housing should be designed for easy
refilling and changing of grease.  When frequent
refilling of grease is required, such as at high
rotating speeds, a grease nipple should be
installed and use of a grease gun for refilling is
advisable.
6.3.3 Replenishing Interval
Even if high-quality grease is used, there is
deterioration of its properties with time so
periodic replenishment is required.  Fig. 6.2
shows the replenishment time intervals for
various bearing types running at different
speeds.  This figure applies only if the
temperature of the bearing is less than 70°C;
the replenishment time interval must be reduced
by half for every 15°C temperature rise of the
bearings.
The refilling intervals shown in Fig. 6.2 are for
applications where the entry of damaging
foreign debris such as dust, dirt and water is
limited.  Therefore, when such damaging

7. Bearing Seals
To ensure the longest possible life of a
bearing, it may be necessary to provide seals
to prevent leakage of lubricant and entry of
dust, water and other harmful material like
metallic particles.  The seals must be free from
excessive running friction and the probability of
seizure.  They should also be easy to assemble
and disassemble.  It is necessary to select a
suitable seal for each application considering
the lubricating method.
Contact seals are effective because of the
contact they maintain with the shaft.  They are
made of synthetic rubber, synthetic resin, felt or
other materials, depending on operating
conditions and type of lubricant.  Oil seals with
synthetic rubber lips are the most common.
7.1 Oil Seals
Synthetic rubber oil seals are usually used in
environments where large amounts of dust, dirt,
water and other foreign matter can easily enter
bearings.  Oil seals are standardized in JIS
B2402.  Suitable oil seals for NSK drawn cup
needle roller bearings are listed in the bearing
tables on page B242.
When mounting a synthetic rubber oil seal,
lubricant should be applied to the seal lip
because wear and heat generation easily occur
if there is no oil film between the seal lip and
shaft.  When oil seals are used at high
peripheral surface speed or under high internal
pressure, the contact surface of the shaft must
be smoothly finished and the shaft eccentricity
should be 0.02 to 0.05 mm or less.
The contact surface of the shaft should be
hardened to enhance its resistance to wear.
Generally, hardness of the shaft surface should
be higher than HRC40.  However, under high-
wear conditions, it should be higher than
HRC55.
Permissible peripheral speeds and
temperature ranges are shown in Table 7.1,
and criteria for the relationship between shat
peripheral surface speed and the roughness of
contact surfaces are shown in Table 7.2.
7.2 Oil Grooves
Oil grooves, flingers and labyrinths function
as non-contact seals.  Sealing is achieved by
several grooves provided on either or both the
shaft and housing.  Applying grooves on both
surfaces is more efficient for oil lubrication.  The
clearance between the shaft and housing
should be as small as possible.  Recommended
clearance values are shown in Table 7.3.
The recommended groove width is
approximately 3 to 5 mm, with a depth of about
4 to 5 mm.
When using only grooves for sealing, three or
more of them should be used.  This sealing
method is frequently used to prevent leakage of

influences are present, it is necessary to
shorten the refilling interval.
6.3.4 Oil Lubrication
(1)   Oil Bath Lubrication
Oil bath lubrication is a widely used method
in the case of low or medium speeds.  The oil
level should be at the center of the lowest roller.
It is desirable to provide a sight  gauge so the
proper oil level may be maintained.
(2)   Splash Lubrication
With this lubricating method, oil is splashed
onto the bearing by a gear or rotating disc
installed near the bearing.  The entry of oil into
the bearing depends on the position of the
bearing, bearing type, how the splash is
produced, and other factors.  Improper
lubrication at the beginning of rotation occurs in
some cases due to the insufficient supply of oil.
The reduction gear with an oil reservoir and
device for maintaining the oil level shown in Fig.
6.3 provides an example of how to prevent such
insufficient initial-stage lubrication.
Another effective method of splash lubrication
involves an oil reservoir with a V-shaped oil
groove and the positioning of the oil drain in a
high location.  Additionally, installing a device
with a magnetic plug to protect against the
penetration of wear particles generated by
gears is effective.
(3)   Circulating Lubrication
Circulating lubrication is commonly used for
high-speed operation requiring bearing cooling
and for bearings used at high temperatures.  As
shown in Fig. 6.4, oil is supplied by the pipe on
the right side, it travels through the bearing and
drains out through the pipe on the left.  After
being cooled in a reservoir, it returns to the
bearing through a pump and filter.  The oil
discharge pipe should be larger than the supply
pipe so an excessive amount of oil will not back
up in the housing.
(4)   Drip Feed Lubrication
This method uses an oiler from which a small
amount of oil drips into the bearing.  The
amount of oil supplied varies depending on
bearing type.  For smaller bearings, the oil
supply rate is generally one drop every three to
eight seconds.  This method can be used at
relatively high speeds for normal or light loads.
(5)   Other Oil Lubrication Methods
Other methods include jet lubrication and oil
mist lubrication.  For needle bearings, however,
these are not commonly used because of the
limitation on limiting speed and space in the
vicinity of the bearing.

8. Bearing Handling
8.1 Precautions for Proper Handling of
Bearings
Rolling bearings are high-precision machine
parts and must be handled accordingly.  Even if
high-quality bearings are used, their expected
performance cannot be achieved if they are not
handled properly.  The main precautions to be
observed are as follows:
(1)   Keep Bearings and Surrounding Area
Clean
Dust and dirt, even if invisible to the naked
eye, have harmful effects on bearings.  It is
necessary to prevent the entry of dust and dirt
by keeping the bearings and their environment
as clean as possible.
(2)   Handle Bearings Carefully
Heavy shocks during handling may cause
bearings to be scratched or otherwise
damaged, possibly resulting in their failure.
Excessively strong impacts may cause
brinelling, breaking, or cracking.
(3)   Use Proper Tools
Always use the proper equipment when
handling bearings and avoid general-purpose
tools.
(4)   Prevent Corrosion
As perspiration from hands and various other
contaminants may cause corrosion, keep hands
clean when handling bearings.  Wear gloves if
possible.  Take care to prevent rusting of
bearings caused by corrosive gasses.
8.2 Mounting
Mounting methods vary depending on
bearing type and conditions.  It is important to
fully understand each bearing and handle it
properly.  In this section, general mounting
methods are described.  Please note that
special precautions apply when mounting drawn
cup needle bearings (see page B41).
(1)   Press Fits
Fitting with a press is very common.  The
mounting dolly is placed onto a raceway ring
(an inner or outer bearing ring) that is on the
insertion side, then the ring is pushed up into
position slowly by a press.  An example for an
outer ring is shown in Fig. 8.1.
(2)   Shrink Fits
When mounting an inner ring onto a shaft,
shrink fitting is widely used.  The maximum
heating temperature of the bearing must be no
BEARING SEALS

oil when the presence of dust and foreign
particles is relatively low.  Oil grooves are
efficient for both oil and grease lubrication at
low-speed operation.  Filling the groove with
grease of a consistency of approximately 200 is
most effective.
7.3 Flingers (Slingers)
Flingers use centrifugal force to throw off oil
and dust, and at the same time act as a pump
to prevent the leakage of oil and entry of dust.
As shown in Fig. 7.2, a flinger used for
preventing the entry of dust is effective when
combined with other bearing seals.  However,
due to the fact that the centrifugal force of the
flinger pulls the oil inside the housing, care
should be exercised during design.
7.4 Labyrinth Seals
Among non-contact methods, the labyrinth
seal is the most effective and appropriate for
preventing oil leakage from a high-speed shaft.
The clearance values shown in Table 7.4 for
labyrinth seals are recommended.  The sealing
effect can be enhanced by filling the clearance
with grease.  Various structures for labyrinth
seals exist.  An example is shown in Fig. 7.3.

are considered only as guide values.  When
designing withdrawal tools, rigidity tolerances
should be 5 to 6 times the values found in the
figures.
8.4 Operating Inspection
After mounting has been completed, a
running test should be conducted to determine
if the bearing has been properly mounted.  Any
sharp increase in speed to normal levels should
be avoided as this could cause damage in the
bearing in the event of improper mounting or
heat seizure of the bearing in the event of
incorrect lubrication.
During the operating inspection, it is
necessary to check for the following items to
determine if there are any abnormalities:
(1)   Manual Inspection
・Sticking (dust and dirt, flaws)
・Uneven torque (improper mounting)
・Excessive torque (inadequate clearance,
high seal friction)
(2)   Powered Operating Inspection
・Abnormal noise (dust and dirt, flaws,
incorrect lubrication, excessive or
insufficient residual clearance)
・Operating temperature saturation,
temperature rise per unit hours (incorrect
lubrication, improper mounting)
During the powered inspection, gradually
increase speed while ensuring that no
abnormalities appear at each stage.  Only the
powered operating inspection is necessary for
large bearings.
8.5  Dismounting
Bearings are dismounted for periodic
inspections and other purposes.  When the
bearing is planned to be reused after
dismounting or to have its condition examined,
dismounting has to be carried out with extra
care.  When the fit is tight, dismounting is
difficult.  Therefore, careful consideration should
be taken in designing the structure of the
bearing vicinity.
When dismounting bearings, specially
designed withdrawal tools (Fig. 8.5) or presses
(Fig. 8.6) are to be used.
NSK NEEDLE BEARING
BEARING HANDLING
A 46
more than 120°C.  When the bearing is cooled
down after mounting, the inner ring contracts in
the axial direction, creating a clearance
between the inner ring and shoulder.  To
prevent this clearance from occurring, the inner
ring and shoulder should be kept in tight
contact with each other using a nut.  The
relationship between heat temperature
differences, bearing dimensions and the amount
of inner ring expansion is shown in Fig. 8.2.
(3)   Driving Fits
When interference is low in bearings with
small dimensions, driving fitting is sometimes
used during mounting.  In this method, a
hammer (made of resin) is used to drive the
ring in.  The mounting dolly is placed on the
ring,s surface, and force must be applied
evenly to its entire surface.  However, this
method is not generally recommended because
it often causes bearing damage.
8.3 Insertion and Removal Force
Insertion force, which is the force to press the
bearing onto a shaft or into a housing with
interference, and removal force, which is the
force to remove the bearing from a shaft or
housing, are calculated using the following
equation.
K ＝μpmπd (or D)・B.........................(8.1)
where,
K: Insertion force or removal force
(N), {kgf}
pm: Surface pressure on the fitting
surface (refer to Table 5.1)
(N/mm2), {kgf/mm2}
d: Nominal bore diameter (mm)
D: Nominal outside diameter (mm)
B: Nominal inner (outer) ring width
(mm)
μ: Sliding friction coefficient of shaft
and inner ring, or of housing and
outer ring (from Table 8.1)
The value pm in equation 8.1 is calculated
from the value found in Table 5.1.  However, in
the case of an inner ring and shaft, the value k
in Table 5.1 varies, depending on bearing type
and dimension series, between 0.7 to 0.9.
Assuming k ＝0.8, the line graphs shown in Fig.
8.3 are calculated when the shaft is solid (i.e., 
k0 ＝0).
Likewise, the insertion and removal forces
calculated for outer rings and the housings at h
＝0.9 and h0 ≒0 are shown in Fig. 8.4.
The actual insertion and removal force may
significantly exceed calculated values due to
mounting error.  The values in Fig. 8.3 and 8.4

8.6 Cleaning
When a dismounted bearing is being reused,
the bearing should be cleaned to remove
harmful foreign matter such as sand metallic
particles, sludge and deteriorated lubricant.
Light oil or kerosene is generally used as a
cleaning agent.  The cleaning procedure should
be divided into a rough wash and a finishing
wash, and a container with an elevated metal
net should be used so that the bearing does
not contact the bottom of the container.
Maintaining the cleanliness of the cleaning oil
is very important.  It should therefore be
circulated through a filter at all times.

NSK cage & Needle roller assemblies consist of a complement of needle
rollers held in place by a cage.  Their unitized design makes for easy
handling and installation.  With no inner or outer ring, the low cross-section
provides maximum load-carrying capability within the smallest envelope.
Properly lubricated, they can operate at high speeds thanks to the unique
cage, which guides the rollers precisely.  The controlled contour rollers in
cage & Needle roller assemblies have an optimum profile which reduces
end stresses, allows operation under moderate misalignment and prolongs
bearing life.
DESIGN AND TYPES
The most common cage used in cage & Needle roller assemblies is the
M-type.  M-type cages are either pressed from steel plate or machined.
These cages undergo surface hardening after processing to attain high
wear resistance and rigidity.  The cages facilitate optimum lubrication
conditions because lubricant can be easily replenished.  Other cages
include those made by precision pressing, welded cages and polyamide
molded cages.  Welded cages, which are produced by welding pressed
steel, as especially suited for mass production.  Applying its considerable
experience and knowledge, NSK supplies cage & Needle roller assemblies
of the highest quality.
Codes for the various types of cage & Needle roller assemblies are
shown in Table 1.  There are many types of cage & Needle roller
assemblies other than those in Table 1, including split cages.  Cage &
Needle roller assemblies for engine connecting rods are included on page
B9 as one of a special series.

ACCURACY STANDARDS
NSK cage & Needle roller assemblies use rollers classified as JIS third
class or higher.  Roller accuracy is shown in Table 2.
APPLICATION
Mounting
(1)  With cage & Needle roller assemblies, the shaft and housing are
generally used as raceway rings.  It is important to satisfy the finish
accuracy and hardness requirements in Table 3.
(2) Guide width for cage & Needle roller assemblies
The tolerances for the guide width, b, are based on cage width, Bc, and
shown in Table 4 (see Fig. 1).
(3)  Fillet Radius
The fillet radius of the shaft and housing shoulder in contact with the cage
end surface should not interfere with the cage itself.

Cage & Needle roller assemblies for connecting rods used in small
general-purpose engines such as those in compact cars, motorcycles,
outboard marine motors, snow-mobiles and chain-saws operate in harsh
conditions characterized by shock loads, complex motion, high
temperatures, and lubrication difficulties.  Cage & Needle roller
assemblies FWF ... E, FBN ... E are specially designed for such
conditions.  Cage & Needle roller assemblies for connecting rods contain
a highly rigid and wear-resistant lightweight cage and high-accuracy
rollers with special crowning.
TYPES
Cage & Needle Roller Assemblies for the Large Ends of
Connecting Rods
FWF ... E
FWF ... E Cage & Needle roller assemblies for large ends of
connecting rods are lightweight and highly rigid.  Their outside surface is
accurately finished to maintain proper guide clearance during operation.
Special steel that is hardened to the proper depth by carbonitriding is
used as material for the cages.  Depending on operating conditions, 
wear resistance is enhanced by surface treatment with non-ferrous metal.
For integrated one-piece crankshafts, split cage & Needle roller
assemblies are also manufactured.
Cage & Needle Roller Assemblies for the Small Ends of
Connecting Rods
FBN ... E
Owing to their high static load rating, cage & Needle roller assemblies
for small ends of connecting rods contain many long rollers with
diameters of 1.5 to 2.5 mm, lowering the contact pressure within the load
zone.  Depending on the structure of the engine, a bore surface-guided
or outside diameter-guided cage is used.

APPLICATIONS
Specifications for Connecting Rods,
Crank Pins and Gudgeon Pins
The small and large end bores of the connecting rod, which function as the
raceway surface of the cage & Needle roller assemblies, and the outside
diameter of the crank pin and gudgeon pin must have the following specifica-
tions in order to obtain the beat performance, even under harsh operating
conditions, from cage & Needle roller assemblies for connecting rods.
(1)
Raceway Surface Roughness
The roughness of the raceway surface of the crank pin and gudgeon pin,
which can lead to premature wear under severe operating conditions, should
be approximately 0.1pmRmax.  Roughness for the large end bore and small
end bore of the connecting rod should be 0.25pmRa or less.
(2)
Raceway Surface Hardness and Effective Hardened Layer Depth
The surface hardness of the raceway should be HRC60 to 64.  The
effective hardened layer depth (depth to HV550) varies depending on load
conditions, but should range from 0.6 to 1.2 mm.
(3)
Raceway Accuracy
Requirements for out-of-roundness and cylindricity of the raceway are listed
in Table 1.
(4)   Parallelism for Large and Small End Bores of Connecting Rods
Improper parallelism between the large end bore and small end bore of the
connecting rod decreases engine performance.  The two bores therefore have
to be finished with a high degree of accuracy.  It is recommended that
parallelism is less than or equal to 0.04 mm for each 100 mm for normal and
low speeds, and less than or equal to 0.02 mm for each 100 mm for high
speeds.
(5)
Abutment Tolerance for Mounting
Radial internal clearance in cage & Needle roller assemblies for connecting
rod large and small ends should be determined by engine type,
characteristics, and operating conditions.  In general, h5 for the piston
diameter, G6 for the samall end bore, g5 or f5 for the crank pin diameter, 
and G6 for the large end bore should be applied.  When the radial internal
clearance has to be strictly limited, it is recommended to use the values in
Table 2.  As to the large end, the upper limit of the internal clearance
should be the target value under high-speed rotation.

NSK drawn cup needle roller bearings (with a cage and full complement of
rollers) have a unique outer ring structure.  They have the following features: the
thinnest outer ring among rolling bearings, high load capacity, high maximum
permissive load owing to the use of carefully selected special alloy steel plates, a
surface-hardened cage with high resistance to wear, high limiting speed, and ease
of mounting.
DESIGN AND TYPES
NSK drawn cup needle roller bearings consist of an outer ring made of carefully
selected alloy steel that is surface-hardened after precise pressing, rollers made of
vacuum-degassed bearing steel that are given a grinding finish after through-
hardening, and a cage that guides the rollers correctly on the pitch diameter. 
The bent lip of the drawn cup, which is the outer ring, improves rigidity, holds the
rollers and cage in place, and functions as a labyrinth seal to prevent foreign matter
from entering and lubrication from leaking.  The inside of the outer ring's bending part
is hardened, and has sufficient wear resistance against the contact of the roller or
cage.

DRAWN CUP NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS

INTERNAL CLEARANCE
The radial internal clearance when a drawn cup needle bearing is mounted in a
housing varies depending on the bearing, shaft and housing bore tolerances.
Therefore, the tolerances for the shaft and housing bore should be narrower when
reducing the range of radial internal clearance.
When the dimensional tolerance for each part is as shown in Fig. 1 (Example of F-
3020-1), the radial internal clearance ranges from 0.015 to 0.074 mm.
APPLICATION
Shaft and housing specifications
For drawn cup needle bearings, the shaft is generally used as a substitute for the
inner ring.  Since the outer ring of drawn cup needle bearings is made of a thin steel
plate, the correct shape and dimensional accuracy are achieved after press fitting the
regular housing.  The dimensional accuracy and hardness of the shaft and housing
bore directly affect bearing performance.  Therefore, the following specifications
should be satisfied.
(1)
Accuracy, Roughness and Hardness
Accuracy, roughness and hardness of the shaft and housing bore should satisfy the
specifications shown in Table 2.
(2)   Shaft Inclination
Shaft inclination due to deflection by external force and mounting error of the
bearing should be within the values found in Table 3.
NSK NEEDLE BEARING
The bearing numbers of NSK drawn cup bearings are shown in
combination with bearing codes and dimension numbers.
The bearing codes are shown in Table 1.
(Example) FJ-1612-OH
Special Specifications
The bearing is manufactured in accordance with special specifications depending
on operating conditions.  In this case, the code is indicated with the bearing number
followed by a hyphen and a letter or alphanumeric combination.
(Example) OH .... outer ring with oil hole
ACCURACY
Although standard drawn cup needle bearings perform well for general use,
higher-accuracy drawn cup needle bearings are sometimes required such as when
dispersion of radial internal clearance needs to be sharply decreased, when eccentric
effects should be minimized, or when using only a few bearings to share the load
evenly.  However, standard bearings are still sufficient for almost all other occasions.
Considering the higher cost of high-accuracy bearings, please consult NSK when
selecting such bearings.

MOUNTING
When an drawn cup needle roller bearing is pressed into a housing bore, it is
necessary to use an appropriate jig to prevent deformation of and damage to the
outer ring, as shown in Fig. 2.  The following precautions apply when mounting:
(1)
The marked-side face should be placed onto the shoulder of the jig.
(2)   A hand press should be used for press fitting.  Avoid using a hammer or other
such instruments. 
(3)   No snap ring or shoulder to determine the position of the bearing is necessary.
However, when using a housing with a shoulder, the bearing side face should not
touch the shoulder, in order to prevent bearing deformation.
(4)   The guide and locaing stopper (Fig. 2) are installed in order to apply press
fitting accurately.  The ball detent shown in Fig. 2 helps the jig hold the bearing
and prevent roller inclination while facilitating mounting work.
Inspection of Drawn Cup Needle Bearings
Deformation to a certain degree due to heat treatment is inevitable even though the
outer ring of drawn cup needle bearings is processed by precise deep drawing.
However, once the bearing is pressed into the regular housing, this deformation is
corrected and the bearing performs to the full potential.  Therefore, it is not
appropriate to measure the drawn cup outside diameter before mounting.  Correct
inspection is carried out according to following procedures:
(1)   The bearing that is to be subject to the test is pressed into a ring gauge of given
dimensions.
(2)   The inscribed circle diameter at the GO and NO-GO plug gauges is inspected.
Metric inspection gauge dimensions are shown in Table 5.
Table 6 shows tolerance for the roller inscribed circle diameter based on ISO
standards.
For bearings based on ISO standards, "-1" is added at the end of the bearing
number.  Table 7 shows inch inspection gauge dimensions.
NSK NEEDLE BEARING
DRAWN CUP NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS
B 40
(3)   Housing Rigidity
To maintain the accuracy of drawn cup needle bearings, it is necessary to design
the housing thick enough to minimize deformation when load is applied.
Split housings can only be used with drawn cup needle bearings after press fitting
the bearing into a cylindrical sleeve.
FITTING
Drawn cup needle bearings perform as designed only after proper fitting.  It is
necessary to use the fitting tolerances shown in Table 4 for the shaft and housing bore.
The figures in Table 4 are for fits when housing materials are rigid steel or cast iron.
The fit should be adjusted as follows in accordance with operating conditions:
(1)
Oscillating motion
In order to reduce radial internal clearance, the shaft's fitting tolerance should be
js6 ( j 6).
(2)
Outer ring rotation
For metric bearings, the fitting tolerances of the shaft and housing bore should be
f6 and R7, respectively.
For inch bearings, 0.013 mm should be reduced from both fitting tolerances of
shaft and housing bore.
(3)   The housing is made from light alloy or steel with a thickness of less than
6 mm.
The fitting tolerances of housing bore should be minimized to approximately 0.013
to 0.025 mm, provided that the optimized value should be determined by mounting
into the actual housing because the value may vary depending on housing material
and shape.  Please contact NSK for details.

Drawn Cup Needle Bearings with Seals
Drawn cup needle roller-bearing with seals can be sealed on one or both sides.
The bearings are packed with lithium soap-based grease and can be operated
under regular conditions in normal operating ranges for long periods without
replenishment.  The seale made of nitrile synthetic rubber reinforced with a steel
plate and serves as a guide for the side face of the cage.  The operating
temperature range is limited because of the rubber seal, ranging from -10°C to
+100°C for continuous use from -25°C to +120°C for short periods of use.
The various types of drawn cup needle bearings with seals are shown in
Table 8.

Solid needle roller bearings are high-accuracy bearings with maximum
load capacity within a limited space for various operating conditions.
Made of carefully selected vacuum-degassed bearing steel or carburizing
steel, the raceway rings are finished with accurate grinding after heat
treatment.  The outer rings have strong integrated ribs and contain high-
accuracy rollers that have the proper crowning finish.  Lightweight and
extremely strong, the cage guides the rollers accurately and smoothly.
DESIGN AND TYPES
Solid needle roller bearings come in various types ranging from the light
to heavy load use of the metric bearings to heavy load use of inch
bearings.  Each type is available in series with and without an inner ring,
and both series are shown in the same bearing table.  Types of solid
needle roller bearings are shown in Table 1, while the composition of
bearing numbers is shown in Table 2.
Among NSK solid needle roller bearings, the RNA, NA49, 59, 69 and 48
series follow the international dimension system that conforms to ISO
standards.
HJ, HJ ＋IR series of inch bearings are widely used globally and conform
to the MIL standards of the U.S.A.
RLM and LM types are bearings whose section height is close to that of
drawn cup needle bearings.

Table 2   Bearing Numbers for Solid Needle Roller Bearings
Remarks
For full complement RLM, LM, RNA and NA, the letter "V" is followed by the bearing number.
RNAF and NAF are different from other solid bearings in that they have a
separable inner ring, outer ring, and cage and rollers, which can all be
combined to allow the optional radial internal clearance to be chosen.  For
most operating conditions, they can be easily mounted.
Bearings with seals are also manufactured; please consult NSK.
Typical structure and features of solid needle roller bearings are shown in
Fig. 1.
ACCURACY
All NSK solid needle roller bearings, excluding inch bearings HJ and HJ
+ IR, conform to ISO, and dimensional accuracy and rotating accuracy are
in accordance with ISO (refer to pages A26 and A27).  When highly
accurate bearings are especially required, bearings in Class 6 or higher are
also available.
Tolerance values for inch bearings HJ and HJ + IR are shown in Table 3.
Tolerances for inscribed Circle Diameter
NSK metric needle roller bearings are primarily manufactured within the
inscribed circle diameter tolerance class F6 (refer to Table 4 on page B92).
RLM and LM types that have a small section height, however, are whithin
F7.  Tolerances for the inscribed circle diameter of inch needle bearings
are shown in Table 5 on page B93.

Table 9   Abutment and Fillet Dimensions for RNAF and NAF
Units: mm
Fitting
Depending on the application, the outer ring of NSK solid needle roller
bearings is used with either a transitional fit or a tight fit.
Recommended fittings for solid needle roller bearings are shown in
Table 8.
Please refer to Tables 5.2 and 5.3 on page A33 to fully consider operating
conditions and choose the appropriate fittings.
For needle bearings without an inner ring, various radial inner clearances
are achieved by selecting the proper shaft tolerance from Table 4.6 on page
A25.
Mounting
Solid needle roller bearings generally require the shaft and housing
shoulder to fix the inner and outer rings and prevent them from moving in
the axial direction during operation (Fig. 2).
The unmarked surface of both the inner and outer rings should be placed
onto the shaft or housing shoulder when mounting.  The diameter of the shaft
shoulder should be smaller than the outside diameter of the inner ring.
Because the RNAF and NAF types do not have ribs, abutment and fillet
dimensions should be carefully observed when designing the bearing
surroundings.  Examples of mounting, abutment and fillet dimensions are
shown in Fig. 3 and Table 9.

For use when shafts cannot be finished with proper accuracy and
hardness, NSK produces inner rings that are made from carefully selected
bearing steel and finished with heat treatment and grinding work.
TYPE
The various types of inner rings for needle roller bearings are shown in
Table 1.
ACCURACY
Dimensional accuracy of the inner rings of NSK needle roller bearings
conforms with ISO (refer to pages A26 and A27).  Tolerances for inch inner
rings are shown in the dimensional table for drawn cup bearings, and in
Table 3 on page B92 for solid bearings.
MOUNTING
The inner ring is mounted with the unmarked side placed onto the shaft
shoulder.
Fitting tolerance for the drawn cup needle bearing shaft should be h6 or
js6 (j6).  When requesting a tight fit for the inner ring, please consult NSK.
Each shaft fitting tolerance for the inner ring for solid needle bearings is
shown in Table 5.2 on page A33.

Thrust needle bearings type comes in metric and inch designs.
The cage & Needle roller assembly for the thrust needle bearing is a
cage that has two pieces joined together (refer to Fig. 1), to which surface
hardening is applied after the precision press processing of a steel plate,
and in which high accuracy rollers are incorporated, in order to achieve
rigidity and wear resistance.  Many rollers are retained securely in the cage,
taking large axial load, and yet rotating smoothly.  Mounting space is so
small that it is easy to replace a conventional sliding thrust washer.
Different thicknesses of various types of thrust raceway washers are
available in this cage & Needle roller assembly, which allows selection of
the appropriate thickness suited for bearing peripheral mounting conditions.

Several types of thrust bearings are shown in Table 1.
For inch bearings, the dimension number is expressed in integers in units
of 1/16 inch.
Raceway washers are available for use when the raceway surface cannot
be hardened by heat treatment and ground to the proper finish.
Types of raceway washers used for cage & Needle roller assemblies in
thrust needle bearings are shown in Table 2.
Other than the rings shown in Table 2, raceway washers with flanges at the
bore or outside are also available.
Accuracy
Thrust Needle Bearings
NSK metric FNTA cage & Needle roller assemblies conform with ISO
criteria, and the fitting tolerance of the cage born diameter is E11 and that
of the outside diameter is c12.
The dimensional tolerances for inch NTA cage & Needle roller
assemblies, and metric and inch thrust raceway washers are shown in the
dimensional table.  The accuracy class of the rollers is Class 3 of ISO.

Table 4   Recommended Fitting for Thrust Bearing
Units: mm
Remarks
Dc in the table to the bore and outside surface of the cage.
Please consult NSK regarding fitting of bearing types other than those shown in Table 4.
Application
Thrust Needle Bearings
When using FNTA and NTA cage & Needle roller assemblies, using the
gear side as a raceway ring saves bearing space (refer to Fig. 2).
In general, the accuracy, surface roughness, and hardness of the raceway
components should satisfy the specifications shown in Table 3.
When a cage & Needle roller assembly cannot be used by itself, a thrust
raceway washer should be employed.  The raceway washer should be
selected after considering washer support face and the volume of the load.
The thrust raceway washer should be set to prevent sliding between the
contact surfaces.
When the area supporting the raceway washer is sufficiently large, a thin
raceway washer, such as the FTRA and TRA types, can be used.  It should
be noted that even if the washers of the FTRA and TRA types are warped, an
axial load of more than approximately 196 N｛20 kgf｝will flatten them.
When the support face of the shaft or housing is small (refer to Fig. 3).
FTRE and TRD types, which are thick-wall raceway washers, or any of the
other thicker types should be used.  In any case, to bring out the full
performance of the bearing, the squareness of the support face should be
ensured and sufficient space is needed in the support face.
For squareness of the raceway washer support face, the values shown in
Table 3 are applied.  Please consult NSK regarding shape and accuracy.
Bearing Guide
The cages used in FNTA and NTA cage & Needle roller assemblies are
guided by the shaft along their extended cage bore.
Bore diameter tolerance is smaller than that for the outside diameter, and
as relative speed at the guide face is slow, the bore guiding method is
effective.  When the outside of the cage is guided, it is necessary for the
housing guide surface to be hardened, at least on its surface, to protect it
from wear.
Fitting
Recommended fittings for thrust needle bearings is shown in Table 4.

Accessories
NSK cam followers include a sealing plug but the nut, washer and
grease nipple are available as accessories.  When ordering, please add the
part code shown in Table 5 after the bearing number.
Applications
Fitting
The recommended fittings for the mounting area of cam follower studs
are shown in Table 6.  Since cam followers use cantilever mounting, the
fitting for the stud and mounting hole should be assembled with as little
play as possible.  In case there is interference in the fitting of the stud and
mounting hole, the center of the stud end should be inserted with a press.
The side plate should be securely fixed onto the plane surface square to
the center axis, without play.  In order to get a sufficient support face for
the side plate, the dimension of the shoulder should be larger than the
value of F shown in the bearing table.  Play in the mounting part should be
avoided because it would not only cause inclination to the stud but also
create considerable deflection when a load is imposed.  The load would
also be unevenly imposed on the rollers due to edge contact between the
outer ring and track (on which the outer ring runs).
Maximum Permissible Load
The maximum radial load that the cam follower can carry is determined by
the bearing strength and shear strength of the stud rather than the load rating
for needle bearings.  This value is given in the bearing table as the maximum
permissible load.
The cam follower can deliver a performance of the maximum strength of
stud by mounting securely to the side plate so as to minimize overhang.  It is
necessary, therefore, to minimize chamfering at the corner of the stud
mounting hole and avoid burrs.
Permissible Track Load
The permissible load of the track is determined by compression strength or
hardness.  The permissible load of the track shown in the bearing table is
the value of a track made of steel with a hardness of HRC40.
Table 7 indicates the permissible load coefficient of the track for each
hardness.
The permissible load of the track for each hardness can be obtained by
multiplying the permissible load of the track shown in the bearing table by
the permissible load coefficient of the track corresponding to each hardness.
Maximum Clamp Torque
Since the stud of the cam follower receives bending stress and tensile
stress from the bearing load, the screw clamp torque should not exceed the
value shown in the bearing table.  The clamp torque (maximum) in the
bearing table is the value when the thread is lubricated and the value when
dry should be approximately doubled.
Pre-packed Grease
The cam follower with a seal is pre-lubricated with lithium soap-based
grease and the working temperature range is -10 to +110°C.

The roller follower with a thick-wall outer ring and crowned roller has a
large load capacity which enables it to carry shock loads.  Handling is easy
since it it non-separating and applications such as track rollers, cams and
rocker arms are wide.
Types
NSK roller rollowers are available in the types shown in Table 1.  All of
the bearings in Table 1 have a cylindrical outside.  Bearings of the
following specifications are available and can be manufactured upon
request:
1.  Outer ring with a spherical exterior
In this case, your order should be placed in the following manner:
(1) For metric bearings, R should be added to the end of bearing
number.
Examples: FYCR-5R,
FYCJ-5R
FYCRS-5R, FYCJS-5R
(2) For inch bearings, C should be added to the end of the bearing
type code.
Examples: YCRC-12
YCRSC-12
Spherical radius of outer ring is shown in page B193.
2.  Exposed surface treated with a black oxide layer
In addition to the above, products of special shape and specifications are
available and can be manufactured upon order.  Please contact NSK for
further details.

Table 5   Spherical Radius, R, of Inch Bearing Outside
Units: mm
Note (1)  While YCRC bearing numbers are listed here, the values of
R also apply to YCRSC bearings.
Accuracy
NSK metric roller followers are manufactured in compliance with ISO
Class 0 (refer to pages A26 and A27), and inch followers in compliance
with the tolerances shown in Table 2.  Running accuracy complies with
ISO Class 0 in both cases.
The deviations for the above apply to the bearings before surface
treatment.
Applications
Fitting
Roller followers are generally used with a transition or loose fit for the shaft
because their outer ring rotates.  With heavy loads, however, it is
recommended to harden the shaft and use it with a tight fit.  In order to
prevent the bearing from moving in the axial direction, both ends of the inner
ring should be securely fixed to the plane surface, square to the center axis.
In order to sufficiently support the side plate, the dimension of the shoulder
should be larger than the value of F in the bearing table.
Recommended fittings are shown in Table 3.
Permissible Track Load
Permissible track load values are the same as those for cam followers.
Please refer to the explanation on permissible track load on page B181. 
Pre-Packed Grease
Roller followers with seals are pre-lubricated with lithium soap-based
grease and the working temperature range is -10 to +110°C.
Spherical Radius of Outer Ring Outside
Spherical radii for metric bearings are shown in Table 4 and for inch
bearings in Table 5.

NSK needle rollers are made of carefully selected degassed bearing steel
and given a precise grinding finish after heat treatment.  Provided with the
following characteristics, they have a wide range of applications, including
gears, small engines and universal joints:
(1)   Most economical when applied as a full complement bearing
(2)   Very high load capacity
(3)   Smaller mounting space
(4)   Rollers with special crowning
Types
Needle rollers come in the types shown in Table 1.
Accuracy
NSK metric needle rollers are manufactured in compliance with ISO.
Dimensions are shown in Table 2 and dimension accuracy in Table 3, 4
and 5.
Inch needle rollers are manufactured with a standard diameter tolerance
of 0 to －5pm.  Needle rollers with a diameter tolerance of 0 to －3pm and
0 to －2pm are also available and manufactured upon request.  Please
consult NSK for further details.

Applications
When a needle roller is applied as a full complement bearing, past
performance generally demonstrates that the application of 35 rollers or less
at a ratio of roller length, Lw, to roller diameter, Dw, of 4 ≦Lw/Dw ≦8
produces good results.  However, with combinations other than the above,
many application results have been obtained.  In general, good performance
can be produced by applying fewer rollers with a larger roller diameter for
normal rotation, and more rollers with smaller roller diameter for oscillation.
Needle Roller Design Guidelines
A standard needle roller is used as a full complement bearing.  It is
possible to easily obtain the approximate shaft diameter and housing bore
diameter for each value of roller diameter and number of rollers from the
graphs in Fig. 1 to Fig. 4 (B204－B206).  For detailed design, shaft
diameter and housing bore diameter can be obtained in accordance with
the design standard shown in Table 6.  For these calculations, the
recommended radial internal clearance, dr, and circumference clearance,
dc, for each application condition are shown in Table 7 and Table 8 and
the Kordal coefficient, K = 1/sin (180°/Z), in Table 9.  For each shaft
and housing bore tolerance class, H6 and h5 are recommended.

Table 10   Keystone Constant
Assembly of Rollers by Keystone
When it is necessary to hold the rollers with the keystone method during
the process of installing them in the housing, whether or not the rollers are
securely held can be checked by the following equation:
Dw (min) × Y ＞D (max)
where,
Dw (min) : Minimum roller diameter dimension 
D (max) : Maximum housing bore dimension
Y
: Keystone constant (refer to Table 10)
Specifications of Shaft and Housing
As needle rollers are applied directly to the
shaft and housing bore, it is necessary to have
the shaft and housing bore conform to uniform
specifications.  For these specifications, please
refer to the section on cage and roller
assemblies on page B7.

Spherical plain bearings are self-aligning.  They are designed to carry
heavy radial loads and combinations of radial and axial loads and to adjust
the inclination of the inner ring and outer ring.
They are widely used in industrial and construction machinery and
equipment that is characterized by low-speed oscillation and operation.
Design and Types
The simple structure consists of an inner ring with a spherical outside
surface of the same diameter mounted to a single or double-cut split outer
ring with a ground, spherical bore surface.  Both inner and outer rings are
made of high-carbon chromium bearing steel, fully hardened to HRC55 or
more, and given a precise grinding finish.  All the surfaces of the inner and
outer rings are given phosphate surface treatment and covered with a coating
of molybdenum disulfide.
The bearing codes and the details are shown in Table 1.  Bearing numbers
are formulated as follows.  (Please note that inch bearings have their own
bearing number formula that differs from metric bearings.)
Although the bearing table shows FSF and SF bearings with single-cut
outer ring, FSBB and SBB types with a double-cut split outer ring are also
available.
Special spherical plain bearings, e.g., thrust spherical plain bearings,
extended inner ring spherical plain bearings and spherical plain bearings
made of special materials are also available.  Please contact NSK for further
details.

Accuracy
The dimensional tolerances of NSK's metric spherical plain bearings are
in accordance with the accuracy of ISO of radial bearings (refer to pages
A26 and A27).  However, dimensional tolerance values are before surface
treatment and outer ring splitting.  For FSBB bearings, the dimensional
tolerance of the inner ring bore diameter is the value after surface
treatment.
The dimensional tolerances of Inch spherical plain bearings are shown in
Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.
Applications
Dynamic Load Capacity (Cd)
The dynamic load capacity shown in the Bearing Table indicates the
maximum load that the bearing can carry under the following conditions:
1.
Intermittent motion and load
2.
Appropriate lubrication and periodic oiling
3.
Appropriate fittings
4.
Proper design of shaft and housing
In the case of continuous operation with the same load, however, the
bearing load is required to be 75% of the dynamic load capacity or less.
For the permissible sliding speed of bearings, which depends on bearing
load, lubrication, heat generation, sliding contact surface condition and other
factors, the PV value is shown here as a guide:
PV ≦24.5 (N/mm2・m/min)
PV ≦2.5 {kgf/mm2・m/min}
where,
P (N/mm2):  Value obtained from the bearing load divided by the
projected area of sliding surface
V (m/mim):  Sliding speed
Special care is needed in lubrication, fitting and other areas in connection
with such motion as high-frequency micro oscillation.  Please consult NSK for
further details.
Maximum Permissible load (Cs)
The maximum permissible load shown in the bearing table is the maximum
static load that can be imposed on the bearing.  If the load carried by the
bearing is close to the maximum permissible load, the stress produced on the
shaft or housing may reach its limit.  Care should be taken accordingly.
Radial Internal Clearance
Depending on bearing dimensions, bearings are manufactured with radial
internal clearance of between 0.09 mm to 0.27 mm before mounting.
Permissible Misalignment
Generally, the permissible misalignment of a spherical sliding bearing is
limited by the bearing's surrounding structure.  Shown in the bearing table is
the angle that allows inclination without any reduction in the permissible load
on a single spherical plain bearings.

Fitting
Recommended fittings for application of spherical plain bearings are
shown in Table 3.
Design of Shaft and Housing
Shaft
In general, because oscillating and rotating motion is generated between
the shaft and inner ring bore surface as the load becomes larger, it is
important to establish a standard shaft hardness and surface roughness.  It is
required, therefore, for the shaft to have a hardness of HRC58 or more and a
routhness of 0.8pmRa.  In addition, in order minimize shaft deflection, the
support part of the shaft should be placed close to the inner ring.
With axial loads, the shoulder of the shaft in contact with the side face of
the inner ring, which serves to support the load, requires sufficient strength
and hardness.  When rotating or oscillating motion is involved, the surface in
contact with the side face of the inner ring should be finished to a roughness
of 0.8pmRa.
Housing
The housing should be rigid enough to avoid deformation caused by
external load.
The critical points of design when using the housing shape shown Fig. 1
are as follows.  In case the external load works in the X direction, the
compressive strength of the housing materials should be greater than the
value of the load divided by the bearing projected area (C × D).
When the external load works in the Y direction, the tensile strength of the
housing should be greater than the value of the imposed load multiplied by
.  The values of coefficient K are shown in Table. 4.

Lubrication
The inner and outer rings are provided with an oil groove and oil hole.
Lubricant should be supplied to the fitting and spherical surface of the shaft
through either the shaft or housing.  The lubrication interval varies depending
on conditions such as magnitude of load, oscillating speed, oscillating angle,
ambient condition and sealing condition.
As the load capacity of the bearing is determined by the oil film strength of
the lubricant to be used, selection of lubricant is important.  In general, a
lubricant containing extreme pressure additives is recommended.

Needle roller bearings for universal joints are available as drawn cup and
solid.  The drawn cup needle bearing has a large load capacity in spite of
its small cross-sectional height.  Since the material for the drawn cup 
(outer ring) is a special alloy steel sheet developed by the bearing performs
well regarding fatigue and shock resistance.  If this drawn cup needle
bearing is applied, an economical universal joint with a large torque
capacity can be designed.
A method for fixing a drawn cup needle bearing to the yoke hole is the
tightening method (staking method).  In some cases, the method of fixation
with a rose washer is adopted.  In any case, mounting is carried out using
dedicated assembly equipment.
As the universal joint uses solid needle bearings in many cases and has
demonstrated a high shock resistance, the bearing is particularly well-suited
for use in universal joints in medium and large trucks.

Types
Needle rolling bearings for universal joints are available in the types in
Table 1.
Drawn Cup Needle Roller Bearings for Universal Joints
These bearings are assembled into universal joints with their own dedicated
assembly equipment.
Universal joints have the following characteristics:
(1)
It is possible to give a light preload between the joint spider end face
and the bearing bottom.
(2)
It is possible to align the joint spider rotating center with the shaft
rotating center as necessary.
(3)
Smaller size, lighter weight and working energy efficiency contribute to a
reduced cost.
Fitting
For each fitting tolerance of the joint spider and yoke hole, k6 and F7 are
recommended respectively.
Accuracy, Roughness and Hardness of the Joint Spider and Yoke Hole
Drawn cup needle bearings form a correct raceway track for the needle
rollers only after press fitting into a yoke hole of specified dimensions.  It is
therefore necessary to finish the yoke hole accurately according to the
dimensions specified.  Accuracy, roughness and hardness of the joint spider
and yoke hole are the same as standard drawn cup needle bearings (please
refer to page B39).  However, yoke hardness is required to be HRC23 to 28.
Solid Needle Roller Bearings for Universal Joints
These bearings have proven past performance and are fixed to the yoke
hole with a snap ring or detent plate.  Because they are solid with a thick-wall
outer ring, the bearing is well-suited for use in universal joints in medium and
large vehicles on which a heavy load is imposed.
Accuracy
The dimensional tolerance of each part varies depending on each bearing.
Please consult NSK for details.
Fitting
As for the fittings between the bearing outside diameter and yoke hole, a
transient or tight fit is commonly applied and the shaft diameter should be
determined so that the radial minimum internal clearance is maintained at
about 0.005 mm.  For each bearing number, please consult NSK.
Code
Details
ZY
Closed end drawn cup needle bearing that is fixed
to the yoke by tightening or with a rose washer.
Closed end solid needle bearing that is fixed to
the yoke with a snap ring or a detent plate. The
outer ring has a sealing structure that varies
depending on the fixation method.

Table 1   Types of Drawn Cup Roller Clutches
Remarks
Drawn cup metric roller clutches have a standard structure of a spring pushing multiple rollers.  In addition, the K
type with a structure of a spring pushing a single roller is available for low torque (K is attached to the end of the
product number).

Drawn cup roller clutches are very compact one-way clutches with a
unique drawn cup outer ring.  In spite of their lightweight and small section
height, torque capacity is high.  Operation is accurate and the friction
torque when overrunning is small.  Mounting is as eazy as drawn cup
needle bearings.
Design and Types
Drawn cup roller clutches are composed of an outer ring, which forms
the cam face on the drawn cup bore surface by precise deep drawing, as
well as rollers, a cage and a spring.
The types of drawn cup roller clutches are shown in Table 1 and the
states of engagement and overruns are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
The metric FCP series for low-torque transmissions and plastic housings
are available.  Please consult NSK for further details.

Clutch Overrun
By the relative rotation of the clutch and the
shaft mounted to housing, the roller operates free
from the wedge face and overruns.  In this case,
the housing and the clutch overrun in a clockwise
direction and the shaft overruns in a
counterclockwise direction.
Fig. 1
Clutch in Engagement
With the force of the spring mounted inside
the clutch produced by the relative rotation of the
clutch and the shaft mounted to the housing, the
roller contacts the wedge face and engages it.
The engagement directions are opposite
depending on whether the shaft or housing is
driven.

Table 3   Fittings for Drawn Cup Roller Clutches
Applications
Specifications of Shaft and Housing
(1)
Accuracy, Roughness and Hardness
Drawn cup roller clutches do not usually use an inner ring but use the shaft
as the raceway ring.  Made of a thin steel plate, they perform best only with
press fitting into a normal housing.  Therefore, the dimensional accuracy and
hardness of the shaft and housing are required to satisfy the specifications
shown below (Table 2).
(2)
Housing Rigidity
In order to obtain the best performance from drawn cup roller clutches, the
housing must have sufficient thickness and be designed to avoid deformation
even if torque and radial loads are imposed.  Special attention should be
paid material quality and wall thickness of the housing.  Housing material
usually consists of steel.  However, if cast iron housing is used, the
maximum load torque value must not exceed 70% of torque capacity. 
For aluminum housing, the same value must not exceed 50% of torque
capacity.
Even with steel housings, the outside diameter shoud be larger than the
minimum outside diameter dimension of the housing shown in the bearing
table.
Fitting
Drawn cup roller clutches can perform as designed only when used with
standard fittings.  Therefore, the shaft and housing bore should be finished to
the recommended fitting dimensions shown in Table 3.  The recommended
values shown in Table 3 are for steel, provided that the housing outer
diameter is larger than the minimum dimension shown in the bearing table.
Depending on application conditions, a fitting change may be required.

Mounting
For press fitting of drawn cup roller clutches into the housing bore, it is
necessary to prevent the outer ring from deformation and damage by using
an appropriate jig as shown Fig. 4.  Precautions for mounting are described
below:
(1)
Use a hand press or similar for press fitting.  Avoid applying blows with
a hammer or similar instrument.  (Fig. 3)
(2)
Place the roller clutch side face on the marked side onto the jig
shoulder.  For accurate press fitting, provide a stopper for the locations
and guide.  (Fig. 4)
(3)
A snap ring and shoulder for positioning the roller clutch are not
required.  When press fitting the roller clutch into the housing with a
shoulder or a closed and, care should be taken not to have the side face
of the roller clutch contact the shoulder or the bottom.  (Fig. 5)
(4)
When assembling the shaft, keep rotating it while mounting.  A large
chamfer for the corner of the shaft is advisable.  (Fig. 6)
Operating Temperature and Engagement Speed
The operating temperature of drawn cup roller clutches should be 90°C or
less for a standard plastic spring and 120°C or less for a stainless steel
spring.
When engagement speed exceeds 200 cycles per minute and when
operation of the spring is impaired by low temperatures, a clutch with a
stainless steel spring must be applied.
Lubrication
Oil lubrication is generally recommended and, in the conditions described
below, it is required.
○Overrunning
○High engagement speed
○Very low transmitting torque
○High operating temperature
As grease lubrication is common, NSK produces bearings packed with
standard grease.
Grease containing extreme pressure additives should be avoided as it may
cause slippage.
Hardening of grease due to deterioration and formation of sludge impair
the lock performance of the clutch.  Extreme caution must be taken for
deterioration of lubricant.
Please consult NSK regarding the lubricant to be applied.
Engagement Direction
Clutch engagement takes place when rotating the housing in the direction
of the arrow (←LOCK) marked on the side face of the drawn cup outer ring.
(Refer to Fig. 7)
Cautions in Application
Some machines using a one-way clutch generate inertia during operation.
In such cases, it is necessary to accurately determine the load torque
imposed on the clutch.
In some cases, the torque actually imposed on the clutch is a far greater
value than the value calculated based on the power source such as a motor
or brake.  Sometimes the transient response at the instant the clutch is
locked, in particular, is this excessive load torque.  (This is caused by the
inertia force of the whole motion system surrounding the mounted clutch and
therefore can hardly be calculated beforehand.)
If such a case is anticipated, it is necessary to select a clutch after
measuring the impact value and correctly grasping the torque imposed on the
clutch.  In any case, the torque imposed on the clutch should not exceed the
torque capacity as shown in the bearing table.
If vibration is involved, the clutch function may be destroyed.  Therefore,
either refrain from using roller clutches when vibration is involved or attach an
effective protection device.  Furthermore, for those parts where an accident
may cause injury or critical damage, add effective protection devices to the
existing equipment.

OIL SEALS FOR NEEDLE BEARINGS
Pages
Single-Lip Synthetic Rubber Seals ............................................................................................................. B242
Double-Lip Synthetic Rubber Seals............................................................................................................ B242
Needle roller bearing oil seals are manufactured to meet the section
height of drawn cup needle bearings.  It is possible, therefore, to mount
them onto the side face of a needle bearing without specially machining the
housing bore.
The oil seals of VC and KC bearings serve as packing because their
outside circumferences are rubber and facilitate easy mounting.
Types
The types of needle roller bearing oil seals are shown in Table 1.
Accuracy
The dimensional tolerance of oil seals complies with ISO6194 (JIS B 2402).
The outside diameter and the width tolerances are shown in Table 2 and
Table 3, respectively.

Fig. 3  Typical Examples of Oil Seal Mounting
APPLICATIONS
Mounting
When single-lip VC bearings are mounted, the lip should be bent inward to
prevent lubricant leakage and outward to prevent entry of foreign matter.
Double-lip KC bearings, which have good sealing properties and high
resistance to foreign particles, emphasize the prevention of entry of foreign
matter and are provided with sufficient interference, so the main lip should be
bent outward.
As wear and heat are easily generated if there is no oil film between the
seal lip and the shaft, a coating of oil must be applied to the seal when
mounting.
When press fitting the seal into the housing as prescribed, any shock that
may cause deformation to the seal should be avoided.  It is recommended to
use a press-fitting jig that is capable of equally pushing the whole back face
of the seal (Fig. 1).
Mounting on Shaft
If there is no slope in the shaft end or there is a key way or screw thread,
the lip can be protected from any damage or peeling by using a bush as
shown in Fig. 2, since the bore diameter of the seal is less than the shaft
diameter.
Coating grease onto the lip can make mounting easier and protect it.  It is
recommended that the shaft end to which the seal is mounted should be
chamfered at about 30 degrees.
Limiting Speed
Limiting speed, which varies depending on the eccentricity of the shaft in
contact and roughness of the finished face, is generally 10 m/sec for VC and
6 m/sec for KC bearings.  In the case of outer ring rotation, it should be harf of
the above values.  The maximum operating temperature is about 120°C for
short periods of operation.
A typical example of oil seal mounting is shown in Fig. 3.

1 lb＝0.45359237 kg
Appendix 2  N-kgf Conversion Table
Appendix 3  kg-lb Conversion Table
(Method of using this table)
For example, to convert 10N into kgf, read the figure in the right
kgf column adjacent to the 10 in the center column in the 1st
block.  This means that 10N is 1.0197kgf.  To convert 10kgf into N,
read the figure in the left N column of the same row, which
indicates that the answer is 98.066N.
(Method of using this table)
For example, to convert 10kg into lb, read the figure in the right lb
column adjacent to the 10 in the center column in the 1st block.
This means that 10kg is 22.046lb.  To convert 10lb into kg, read
the figure in the left kg column of the same row, which indicates
that the answer is 4.536kg.

Appendix 4  °C-°F Conversion Table
Appendix 5  Viscosity Conversion Table
(Method of using this table)
For example, to convert 38°C into °F, read the figure in the right °F
column adjacent to the 38 in the center column in the 2nd block.
This means that 38°C is 100.4°F.  To convert 38°F into °C, read the
figure in the left °C column of the same row, which indicates that
the answer is 3.3°C.
