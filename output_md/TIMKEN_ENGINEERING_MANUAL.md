SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE  
OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS  
AND COMPONENTS
Timken guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated rolling 
bearings, components and assemblies are set forth below. 
Shelf life information is based on test data and experience. 
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/
component design life as follows:
SHELF LIFE POLICY
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation. The 
shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design life. It 
is impossible to accurately predict design life due to variations 
in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating conditions, 
installation conditions, temperature, humidity and extended 
storage.
Shelf life values, available from Timken, represent a maximum 
limit – and assume adherence to the Timken suggested storage 
and handling guidelines. Deviations from Timken’s storage and 
handling guidelines may reduce shelf life. Any speciﬁcation or 
operating practice that deﬁnes a shorter shelf life should be 
used. Timken cannot anticipate the performance of the grease 
lubricant after the bearing or component is installed or placed 
in service.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for its 
ﬁnished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
hereinafter referred to as “Products”):
 t  Unless directed otherwise by Timken, Products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 t  Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on  
the packaging.
 t Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 t  After a Product is removed from its packaging, it should be 
placed into service as soon as possible.
 t  When removing a Product that is not individually  
packaged from a bulk pack container, the container should 
be resealed immediately after the Product is removed.
 t  Do not use Product that has exceeded its shelf life as  
deﬁned in Timken’s shelf life guidelines statement.
 t The storage area temperature should be maintained  
between 0º C (32º F) and 40º C (104º F); temperature  
ﬂuctuations should be minimized.
 t The relative humidity should be maintained below 60  
percent and the surfaces should be dry. 
 t The storage area should be kept free from airborne  
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt,  
harmful vapors, etc.
 t The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration.
 t  Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Inasmuch as Timken is not familiar with a customer’s 
particular storage conditions, these guidelines are strongly 
suggested. However, the customer may very well be required 
by circumstance or applicable government requirements to 
adhere to stricter storage requirements.

Most bearing 
types are typically 
shipped protected 
with a corrosion-
preventive compound 
that is not a lubricant. 
Such bearings may be 
used in oil-lubricated 
applications without 
removal of the corrosion-
preventive compound. When 
using some specialized grease 
lubrications, it is advisable to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before 
packing the bearings with suitable grease.
Some bearing types in this catalog. are pre-packed with 
general purpose grease suitable for their normal application. 
Frequent replenishment of the grease may be necessary for 
optimum performance. Care must be exercised in lubricant 
selection, however, since different lubricants are often 
incompatible. 
When speciﬁed by the customer, other bearings may be 
ordered pre-lubricated.
Upon receipt of a bearing shipment, ensure that the bearings 
are not removed from their packaging until they are ready 
for mounting so that they do not become corroded or 
contaminated. Bearings should be stored in an appropriate 
atmosphere in order that they remain protected for the 
intended period.
Any questions concerning shelf life or storage should be 
directed to your local sales ofﬁce. 
Proper maintenance and handling practices are critical. 
Always follow installation instructions and 
maintain proper lubrication.
Never spin a bearing with compressed air. 
The rollers may be forcefully expelled.
     WARNING
Failure to observe the following warnings could 
create a risk of death or serious injury.

INTRODUCTION
8  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
INTRODUCTION 
Timken is a leader in the advancement of bearing 
technology. Expert craftsmanship, well-equipped 
production facilities, and a continuing investment in 
technology programs ensure that our products are 
synonymous with quality and reliability. Today, our 
plants manufacture several bearing types over a 
broad range of sizes.
Anti-friction bearings inherently manage broad ranges 
of speed and many combinations of radial and thrust 
loads. Other important environmental conditions, such 
as low and high temperature, dust and dirt, moisture, 
and unusual mounting conditions, affect bearing 
operation.
This engineering section is not intended to be 
comprehensive, but does serve as a useful guide in 
bearing selection.
Where more complex bearing applications are 
involved, your Timken engineer should be consulted. 
The following topics are covered within this manual:
 t Bearing design types.
 t Cage design types.
 t Life analysis procedure.
 t Bearing tolerances.
 t Fitting practice and mounting recommendations.
 t Operating temperatures.
 t Speed ratings.
 t Lubrication recommendations.
 t Seal design options.

BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  9
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
The ﬁrst step in bearing selection is to identify the best bearing type for the application.  
Each bearing type has advantages and disadvantages based on its internal design. Table 1,  
on page 10, ranks the different bearing types on various performance characteristics.
The next step is to assess the bearing size constraints including the bore, outside diameter 
(O.D.) and width. This is done by deﬁning the minimum shaft diameter, maximum housing 
diameter and available width for the bearing in the application. At this point, bearings may be 
selected from the manual that ﬁt within the deﬁned size constraints. Several bearings with 
different load-carrying capacities may be available that ﬁt within the envelope.
The third step is to evaluate the known environmental conditions 
and application requirements. Environmental conditions include 
factors such as ambient temperature, applied load, bearing 
speed and cleanliness of the environment immediately 
surrounding the bearing. Application requirements such 
as bearing ﬁts, bearing setting, lubricant type, cage type 
and ﬂange arrangements are determined based on the 
speed, temperature, mounting conditions and loading 
conditions within the application.
Lastly, bearing life calculations are performed that take 
into account all of the environmental and application 
conditions. If more than one bearing has been evaluated 
up to this point, selection is based on the bearing that 
provides the best overall performance for the application. A 
detailed explanation of this analysis procedure is included in the 
following sections. For assistance, contact your Timken engineer for a 
comprehensive computer analysis of your bearing application.

RADIAL BALL BEARINGS 
Although radial ball bearings are designed primarily to support a 
radial load, they perform relatively well under thrust or combined 
radial and thrust load conditions.
Deep-groove ball bearings, commonly called Conrad or non-
filling-slot bearings, are assembled by displacing the inner 
ring relative to the outer ring and inserting balls into the space 
between the rings. By this method, only slightly more than half 
the annular space between the inner and outer rings can be ﬁlled 
with balls. Thus, capacity is limited. 
To increase capacity, a ﬁlling slot or notch can be cut into the 
inner ring, permitting the insertion of balls. Once the balls have 
been inserted, the slot is ﬁlled by an insert. The increased number 
of balls increases radial load capacity, but thrust load capacity 
is sacriﬁced because of the ﬁlling slot.
The non-ﬁlling-slot or Conrad bearing is designated by the sufﬁx 
K and the ﬁlling slot bearing is designated by the sufﬁx W.
BALL BEARINGS WITH SNAP RINGS (WIRELOC)
Single-row radial ball bearings, including those with seals or 
shields and open and shielded double-row types, are available 
with snap rings. The snap ring protrudes from a groove in the 
outer ring and acts as a shoulder to maintain bearing position. It 
is designed for mounting in through-bored housings. This feature 
is designated by adding the sufﬁx G to the standard bearing 
number. Single-shielded or sealed bearings with snap rings can 
be supplied with the snap ring on the same side or opposite the 
shield or seal position.
These bearings are advantageous in automobile transmission 
design and in all applications where compactness is essential, or 
where it is difﬁcult and costly to machine housing shoulders. The 
snap ring provides an adequate shoulder for the bearings without 
a sacriﬁce in bearing capacity. The thrust capacity of the snap 
ring in shear exceeds the thrust capacity of the bearing.
Typical designs illustrating how mounting simpliﬁcation can be 
accomplished through the use of snap ring bearings are shown 
below.

DOUBLE-ROW
Double-row, angular contact ball bearings are used effectively 
where heavy radial, thrust or combined loads demand axial 
rigidity of the shaft. This type is similar to a duplex pair of single-
row bearings by virtue of its two rows of balls and angular-contact 
construction, which provide greater axial and radial rigidity than 
can be obtained by using a single-row radial bearing.
With the exception of small sizes, double-row ball bearings are 
made in the ﬁlling slot construction, and therefore, do not have 
as much thrust capacity as equivalent size single-row, angular 
contact bearings mounted in duplex pairs. Fixed and ﬂoating 
mountings of double-row bearings are shown. Smaller sizes are 
supplied with polymer retainers.
Fig. 4. Typical mountings for double-row, angular contact ball 
bearings.
ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS 
SINGLE-ROW
Single-row, angular contact ball bearings are designed for 
combination loading with high thrust capacity in one direction, 
and are suggested for applications where the magnitude of the 
thrust component is high enough to preclude the use of radial- 
type ball bearings. They are dimensionally interchangeable with 
single-row radial bearings of corresponding sizes. 
The angular contact ball bearing has a relatively large contact 
angle, high ring depths, and a maximum complement of balls 
assembled through a counterbore in the outer ring. These 
features provide bearings with signiﬁcantly more thrust capacity 
than radial bearings of the same size.
Angular contact bearings are used in such applications as gear 
reducers, pumps, worm drives, vertical shafts and machine tool 
spindles, where they are frequently mounted in various single-
row arrangements.

bearings.

PRECISION BEARINGS

MINIATURE AND THIN-SECTION  
BALL BEARINGS
Timken produces precision ball bearings and assemblies in 
miniature, instrument and thin-section series. All are manufactured 
with quality steel, tolerances and features that meet demanding 
application challenges. These precision bearings and assemblies 
are found in surgical and diagnostic imaging devices, precision 
pumps, measurement and material handling equipment, as well as 
guidance, weapons and space applications. Standard sizes range 
from 1 mm to 279.40 mm bore (0.0250 in. to 11.000 in. bore).
Radial ball bearings
These Conrad bearings are available 
in ISO P5/ABEC 5 to ISO P4/ABEC 7 
precision levels as a standard catalog 
offering. The deep-groove construction 
allows for handling of radial, thrust or 
combination loads. These are offered 
primarily with 440C stainless-steel rings 
and balls with one-piece fully machined 
snap-in phenolic cages. In addition to 
52100, other material and cage options 
are available, as well as shields and
seals, and ceramic or titanium carbide-coated balls. Flanges 
are offered on miniature product. Typical applications include 
guidance systems, medical (surgical instruments and devices) 
and robotic joints.
Angular contact ball bearings
Angular contact ball bearings offer 
maximum ball complement with a one-
piece precision-machined retainer. The 
increased ball complement, combined 
with a relatively high contact angle, 
maximizes axial stiffness. Angular 
contact ball bearings are manufactured 
to the same tolerances and standards 
as the radial ball bearings. Rings and 
balls are normally 440C stainless steel, 
but other material options are offered.
Steel and ceramic balls are available as standard. Typical 
applications use preloaded pairs for maximum stiffness, 
high speeds and precise positioning. These include surgical 
handpieces, control moment gyros and other high-speed or high-
stiffness applications.
Fractured ring ball bearings
These bearings have outer rings that 
are radially fractured in one location. 
This permits the ring to be opened for 
complete ﬂexibility in the choice of ball 
complement and cage in a deep-groove 
radial bearing. High-strength stainless-
steel holding bands are pressed on 
the ground shoulders to retain tight 
abutment and alignment of the fractured 
surface during handling and normal 
operation. Full complement and retainer 
conﬁgurations are available. 
Typical applications have a limited radial cross section and a 
limited axial width. These applications require a bearing with 
maximum radial capacity, as well as axial capacity in both 
directions.
Pivot ball bearings
Designed for space constrained environments where low torque 
is required, pivot bearings use the mating shaft for the inner 
raceway. These bearings achieve maximum power density with 
a full complement of larger balls, no cage or inner ring. Shields 
are available for the standard line. Typical applications are in 
guidance systems, such as commercial gyroscopes. 
Thrust ball bearings
These bearings are designed for applications where high axial 
load, low speed and relatively high torque are allowable. The 
standard offering has all stainless steel components for use 
where inert materials are required. Stainless steel allows 
operation as a fuel control governor.

PRECISION BEARINGS – continued 
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Timken’s high-precision tapered roller bearings consist of 
carefully matched components that offer an added degree of 
ﬁne-tuning in the bearing setting and adjustment procedure to 
maximize customer machine productivity. Timken manufactures 
high-speed designs with a variable preload capability for optimum 
performance. Timken also manufacturers Precision Plus bearings – 
having an overall radial runout less than a single micron. 
TS and TSF single-row bearings
These bearings are similar in design to the types described on 
page 16. They are only produced in high-precision quality, to be 
used in machine tool spindles, printing press cylinders and other 
applications where accuracy of rotation is required.
TSHR - Hydra-RibTM  bearing with 

preload adjustment device
For many applications, notably in the 
machine tool industry, bearings are 
required to run at high speeds with a 
controlled preload setting. The Hydra-
Rib™ bearing has a ﬂoating outer ring 
rib controlled by hydraulic or pneumatic 
pressure, which ensures that the 
required bearing preload is maintained 
irrespective of the differential expansions 
or changes in loading taking place within 
the system.
TXR - crossed roller bearing
A crossed roller bearing is two sets of bearing rings and rollers 
brought together at right angles with alternate rollers facing 
opposite directions. TXR bearings have a section height not 
much greater than that of a TS bearing. The steep angle, tapered 
geometry of the bearing causes the load-carrying center of each 
of the rings to be projected along the axis, resulting in a total 
effective bearing spread many times greater than the width of 
the bearing itself. This type of bearing offers a high resistance to 
overturning moments.
The normal design of the bearing 
is type TXRDO, which has a double 
outer ring and two inner rings, 
with rollers spaced by polymer 
cages. Crossed roller bearings 
are manufactured in precision 
classes.
SUPER PRECISION BALL BEARINGS 
The Timken line of super precision 
machine tool ball bearings is designed 
to meet ISO and ABEC tolerance levels. 
However, Timken manufactures all 
super precision ball bearings to surpass 
ISO/ABMA criteria to ensure that the 
end users receive only the highest 
quality product to maximize machine 
performance. Spindle bearings are the 
most popular type of super precision 
ball bearing used within the machine
tool industry. These angular contact bearings are used primarily 
in precision, high-speed machine tool spindles. Timken 
manufactures super precision machine tool bearings in four 
metric ISO dimensional series. In addition, because of specialized 
variations of bearing design and geometry, Timken offers a total 
of seven angular contact bearing types within these four basic 
series:
 t ISO 19 (9300WI, 9300HX series).
 t ISO 10 (9100WI, 9100HX, 99100WN series).
 t ISO 02 (200WI series).
 t ISO 03 (300WI series).
Multiple internal geometries are available to optimize either load-
carrying capacity or speed capability with part number sufﬁxes 
designated as: WI, WN, HX or K. WI-type bearings are designed to 
maximize capacity of the various bearing cross sections and are 
used in low to moderate speeds. The HX is Timken’s proven high-
speed design. It has a signiﬁcant advantage at higher speeds, 
generating less heat and less centrifugal loading forces. The 
WN-type is generally a compromise between the WI and HX as 
it offers higher speed capability than the WI, but lower capacity, 
higher stiffness and lower speed capability than the HX design.
Most of the bearing types are available in either 15 degree 
(2MM) or 25 degree (3MM) contact angles. In addition, Timken 
now stocks more ceramic ball sizes than ever for the highest 
speed requirements. The K-type deep-groove (Conrad) super 
precision radial ball bearing is generally used in applications 
where capacity and stiffness do not require sets containing 
multiple bearings. By virtue of the single-row, radial deep-groove 
construction, and super precision level tolerances, these are 
capable of carrying thrust loads in either direction. Also, they

Easiest of all to install, wide inner ring ball bearings with self-
locking collars are available in various sizes. These bearings, 
shown with various seal and inner ring width variations, serve 
many purposes in farm and industrial applications.
SETSCREW SERIES BEARINGS 
The GYA-RRB and the GY-KRRB series are extended inner ring and 
wide inner ring type bearings with specially designed setscrews 
to lock on the shaft. These bearings can be purchased so that 
they can be relubricated. Positive contact land-riding R-Seals 
provide protection against harmful contaminants and retain 
lubricant. Extended inner ring bearings are used when space is 
at a premium and overturning loads are not a problem. The wide 
inner ring setscrew series is available when additional surface 
contact on the shaft is a requirement for added stability.
Fig. 14. YA-RR series.
CONCENTRIC COLLAR
Using the concentric collar, the bearing is locked to the shaft by 
two setscrews, 120 degrees apart, tightened in the collar and 
passing through drilled holes in the inner ring. These units are 
suited for applications where space is limited and reversing shaft 
rotation is encountered.
Fig. 15. GC-KRRB series.
BALL BEARINGS WITH  
LOCKING DEVICES
By virtue of their independent locking devices, these bearings 
are suitable for mounting on straight shafting (no shoulders, 
etc.). They are often supplied with spherical outer rings for self-
alignment at mounting. Mounted alignment is usually required 
because these bearings are generally assembled into pillow 
blocks or ﬂanged cartridges, or other housings bolted to pedestals 
or frames independent of each other.
SELF-LOCKING (ECCENTRIC) COLLAR 
Timken invented the eccentric self-locking collar to facilitate 
mounting of wide inner ring bearings. The self-locking collar 
eliminates the need for locknuts, lock washers, shoulders, sleeves 
and adapters.
The locking collar has a counterbored recess eccentric with 
the collar bore. This eccentric recess engages or mates with an 
eccentric cam end of the bearing inner ring when the bearing is 
assembled on the shaft.
The collar is engaged on the inner ring cam of the bearing. This 
assembly grips the shaft tightly with a positive binding action that 
increases with use. No adjustments are necessary. The collar 
setscrew provides supplementary locking.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS 
SINGLE-ROW BEARINGS
TS - Single-row
This is the basic and the most widely 
used type of tapered roller bearing. It 
consists of the inner ring assembly and 
the outer ring. It is usually ﬁtted as one 
of an opposing pair. During equipment 
assembly, single-row bearings can 
be “set” to the required clearance 
(endplay) or preload condition to optimize 
performance.
TSF - Single-row,  
          with ﬂanged outer ring
The TSF type is a variation on the basic 
single-row bearing. TSF bearings  have 
a ﬂanged outer ring to facilitate axial 
location and accurately aligned seats in 
a through-bored housing.
TDI
DOUBLE-ROW BEARINGS
TDO - Double outer ring
This has a one-piece (double) outer ring 
and two single inner-rings. It is usually 
supplied complete with a inner-ring 
spacer as a pre-set assembly. This 
configuration gives a wide effective 
bearing spread and is frequently chosen 
for applications where overturning 
moments are a significant load 
component. TDO bearings can be used 
in ﬁxed (locating) positions or allowed to 
ﬂoat in the housing bore, for example, to 
compensate for shaft expansion. TDOCD 
outer rings also are available in most 
sizes. These outer rings have holes in the 
O.D. that permit the use of pins to prevent 
outer ring rotation in the housing.
TDI  - Double inner ring
TDIT - Double inner ring with tapered bore
Both comprise a one-piece (double) inner ring and two single 
outer rings. They are usually supplied complete with an outer- 
ring spacer as a pre-set assembly. TDI and TDIT bearings can be 
used at ﬁxed (locating) positions on rotating shaft applications. 
For rotating housing applications, the double inner ring of type 
TDI can be used to ﬂoat on the stationary shaft. Type TDIT has 
a tapered bore to facilitate removal when an interference ﬁt is 
essential, yet regular removal is required.

SPACER ASSEMBLIES
Any two single-row bearings (type TS) can be supplied as 
a double-row, pre-set, ready-to-ﬁt assembly by the addition 
of spacers, machined to pre-determined dimensions and 
tolerances. 
Spacer assemblies are provided in two types: "2S" and "SR". This 
concept can be applied to produce custom-made double-row 
bearings to suit speciﬁc applications. In addition to providing 
a bearing that automatically gives a pre-determined setting at 
assembly without the need for a manual setting, it is possible 
to modify the assembly width to suit an application, simply by 
varying the spacer widths.
Fig. 21. Spacer assemblies. 
2S - Two single-row assembly
Often referred to as snap-ring assemblies, type 2S consist of 
two basic single-row bearings (type TS). They are supplied 
complete with inner-ring and outer-ring spacers to give a pre-
determined bearing setting when assembled. Type 2S have a 
speciﬁed setting range to suit the duty of the application. They 
have an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring, which also serves as 
the outer-ring spacer, to give axial location in a through-bored 
housing.
SR - SET-RIGHTTM assembly
Type SR are made to a standard setting range, based on Timken’s 
SET-RIGHT™ automated setting technique suitable for most 
industrial applications. They have two spacers and an optional 
snap-ring that may be used for axial location. Because both types 
are made up of popular sizes of single-row bearings, they provide 
a low-cost option for many applications.

These three bearing types are similar to the TDO with a one-piece 
(double) outer ring and two single inner rings. The inner ring 
front faces are extended so they abut, eliminating the need for a 
separate inner-ring spacer. Supplied with a built-in clearance to 
give a standard setting range, these bearings provide a solution 
for many ﬁxed or ﬂoating bearing applications where optimum 
simplicity of assembly is required.
Types TNASW and TNASWE are variations having chamfers 
and slots on the front face of the inner ring to provide lubrication 
through the shaft. Type TNASWE have extended back face ribs 
on the inner rings which are ground on the O.D. to allow for the 
use of a seal or stamped closure. These designs are typically 
used on stationary shaft applications.

Type TDIA is similar to type TDIE with a cylindrical bore. There 
is a provision for a locking collar at one end only. The compact 
conﬁguration is suited to pillow blocks and similar applications. 
On all types, the hardened and ground O.D. of the inner ring

HIGH-SPEED BEARINGS 
TSMA - Single-row with axial oil
TSMR - Single-row with radial oil
Some applications require extreme high-speed capability where 
special lubrication methods must be provided.
The TSMA and TSMR are single-row 
bearings with provisions for lubrication of 
critical roller-rib contact area to ensure 
adequate lubrication at high speeds. 
The TSMA concept works by capturing 
oil in a manifold (attached to the inner 
ring), which is then directed to the 
rib-roller contact through holes drilled 
axially through the large inner ring rib. 
The TSMR functions in a similar manner 
with the difference being that holes are 
drilled radially from the inner ring bore 
to the large rib face. Oil is captured in 
a circumferential groove in the inner 
ring bore. It is directed to the rib-roller 
contact area through radial holes. 
OTHER DOUBLE-ROW BEARINGS
Type TDIE  - Extended double inner ring
Type TDIA  - Extended single inner ring
These double-row bearings are designed for applications where 
it is required to lock the loose-ﬁtted inner ring to a shaft, with 
provision also for effective closure or sealing. Typical applications 
include pillow blocks, disc-harrow and similar agricultural 
machinery shafts and line shafts.

FOUR-ROW BEARINGS
Four-row bearings combine the inherent high-load, radial/thrust 
capacity and direct/indirect mounting variations of tapered roller 
bearings into assemblies of maximum load rating in a minimum 
space. Their main application is on the roll necks of rolling mill 
equipment.
All four-row bearings are supplied as pre-set matched assemblies, 
with all components numbered to ensure correct installation 
sequence.
Type TQO  -  Quad taper
Type TQOW  -  Quad taper with lubrication slots
These pairs of directly mounted bearings consist of two double 
inner rings, two single and one double outer ring, with an inner- 
ring spacer and two outer-ring spacers. These types are used on 
roll necks of low- and  medium-speed rolling mills, applied to the 
necks with a loose ﬁt. When the ﬁllet and/or ﬁller rings do not have 
lubrication slots, they are provided in the faces of the bearing 
inner rings (type TQOW). Slots in the inner-ring spacer permit 
lubricant to ﬂow from the bearing chamber to the roll neck. The 
inner-ring spacers also are hardened to minimize face wear.
Fig. 26. Four-row 
bearing assemblies.
Sealed roll neck
The sealed roll neck bearing is similar to the TQO. A specially 
designed sealing arrangement is incorporated in the bearing 
to endure highly contaminated environments. The special seal 
design is built into the bearing to prevent ingress of contamination 
from outside the bearing envelope and extend the useful 
bearing life.
TQITS
TQITSE
TQO/ TQOW
Type TQITS
Type TQITSE
The main feature of these bearings is a tapered bore – the taper 
being matched and continuous through the inner rings. This 
permits an interference ﬁt on the backup rolls of high-speed mills, 
where a loose inner ring ﬁt of a straight bore type TQO bearing 
could result in excessive neck wear.
These four-row bearings consist of two pairs of indirectly 
mounted bearings: two single and one double inner ring, four 
single outer rings and three outer-ring spacers. The adjacent 
faces of the inner-rings are extended so that they abut, 
eliminating the need for inner-ring spacers. The indirect mounting 
of the bearing pairs increase the overall effective spread of the 
bearing, to give optimum stability and roll rigidity.
Type TQITSE is the same as TQITS, but has an extension to the 
large bore inner ring adjacent to the roll body. This not only 
provides a hardened, concentric and smooth surface for radial 
lip seals, but also improves roll neck rigidity by eliminating a ﬁllet 
ring. This allows the centerline of the bearing to move closer to 
the roll body. It also permits shorter and less costly rolls.

THRUST BEARINGS
Standard types of thrust bearings manufactured by Timken are 
included in this section. Each type is designed to take thrust 
loads, but four types (TVL, DTVL, TTHD and TSR) accommodate 
radial loads as well. All types reﬂect advanced design concepts, 
with large rolling elements for maximum capacity. In roller thrust 
bearings, controlled-contour rollers are used to ensure uniform, 
full-length contact between rollers and raceways with resultant 
high capacity. Thrust bearings should operate under continuous 
load for satisfactory performance.

THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Thrust ball bearings are used for lighter loads and higher speeds 
than thrust roller bearings. Types TVB, TVL and DTVL are shown 
in ﬁg. 30.
Type TVB thrust ball bearing is separable and consists of two 
hardened and ground steel rings with grooved raceways, and 
a cage that separates and retains precision-ground and lapped 
balls. The standard cage material is brass, but this may be varied 
according to the requirements of the application. Timken standard 
tolerances for type TVB bearings are equivalent to ABEC 1 where 
applicable, but higher grades of precision are available.
Type TVB bearings provide axial rigidity in one direction and their 
use to support radial loads is not suggested. Usually the rotating 
ring is shaft-mounted. The stationary ring should be housed with 
sufﬁcient O.D. clearance to allow the bearing to assume its proper 
operating position. In most sizes, both rings have the same bore 
and O.D. The housing must be designed to clear the O.D. of the 
rotating ring, and it is necessary to step the shaft to clear the 
bore of the stationary ring.
Type TVL is a separable angular contact ball bearing primarily 
designed for unidirectional thrust loads. The angular contact 
design, however, will accommodate combined radial and thrust 
loads since the loads are transmitted angularly through the 
balls.
The bearing has two hardened and ground steel rings with 
ball grooves and a one-piece brass cage that spaces the ball 
complement. Although not strictly an angular ball bearing, the 
larger ring is still called the outer ring, and the smaller the inner 
ring. Timken standard tolerances for type TVL bearings are 
equivalent to ABEC 1 where applicable, but higher grades of 
precision are available.
Usually the inner ring is the rotating member and is shaft mounted. 
The outer ring is normally stationary and should be mounted with 
O.D. clearance to allow the bearing to assume its proper operating 
position. If combined loads exist, the outer ring must be radially 
located in the housing.
Type TVL bearings should always be operated under thrust load. 
Normally, this presents no problem as the bearing is usually 
applied on vertical shafts in oil ﬁeld rotary tables and machine 
tool indexing tables. If constant thrust load is not present, it should 
be imposed by springs or other built-in devices.
Low friction, cool running and quiet operation are advantages of 
TVL bearings, which may be operated at relatively high speeds. 
TVL bearings also are less sensitive to misalignment than other 
types of rigid thrust bearings.
DTVL is similar in design to TVL except the DTVL has an additional 
ring and ball complement permitting it to carry moderate thrust 
in one direction and light thrust in the other direction.

THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Type TSR
The TSR thrust spherical roller bearing design achieves a 
high thrust capacity with low friction and continuous roller 
alignment. The bearings can accommodate pure thrust loads as 
well as combined radial and thrust loads. Typical applications 
are air regenerators, centrifugal pumps and deep well pumps. 
Maximum axial misalignment between inner and outer ring is 
±2.5 degrees.
Fig. 32. Thrust spherical roller bearing, type TSR.
THRUST TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Type TTHD
Type TTHD thrust tapered roller bearings have an identical pair 
of hardened and ground steel rings with conical raceways and a 
complement of controlled-contour tapered rollers equally spaced 
by a cage. The raceways of both rings and the tapered rollers 
have a common vertex at the bearing center. This assures true 
rolling motion.
TTHD bearings are well-suited for applications such as crane 
hooks, where extremely high thrust loads and heavy shock must 
be resisted and some measure of radial location obtained.            
For very low-speed, heavily loaded applications, these bearings 
are supplied with a full complement of rollers for maximum 
capacity. For application review of the full complement type TTHD 
bearing, consult your Timken engineer.
Fig. 33. Thrust tapered roller bearing, type TTHD.
THRUST CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Thrust cylindrical roller bearings withstand heavy loads at 
relatively moderate speeds. Standard thrust bearings can be 
operated at bearing O.D. peripheral speeds of 3000 fpm (15 m/s). 
Special design features can be incorporated into the bearing and 
mounting to attain higher operating speeds.
Because loads are usually high, extreme-pressure (EP) lubricants 
should be used with cylindrical roller thrust bearings. Preferably, 
the lubricant should be introduced at the bearing bore and 
distributed by centrifugal force.
All types of thrust roller bearings are made to Timken Standard 
Tolerances. Higher precision may be obtained when required.
Type TP thrust cylindrical roller bearings have two hardened and 
ground steel rings, with a cage retaining one or more controlled-
contour rollers in each pocket. When two or more rollers are 
used in a pocket, they are of different lengths and are placed in 
staggered position in adjacent cage pockets to create overlapping 
roller paths. This prevents wearing grooves in the raceways and 
helps prolong bearing life.
Because of the simplicity of their design, type TP bearings are 
economical. Shaft and housing seats must be square to the axis 
of rotation to prevent initial misalignment problems.
Fig. 31. Thrust cylindrical roller bearings.
Type TPS bearings are the same as type TP bearings except one 
ring is spherically ground to seat against an aligning ring, thus 
making the bearing adaptable to initial misalignment. Its use 
is not suggested for operating conditions where alignment is 
continuously changing (dynamic misalignment).

TTC cageless  
TTSP steering pivot
There are two basic types of Timken® tapered roller thrust 
bearings designed for applications where the only load 
component is thrust, TTC and TTSP. The TTC bearing uses a full 
complement of tapered rollers without a cage and is used when 
the speeds are slow. The TTSP bearing uses a cage and is well-
suited for the oscillating motion of steering pivot positions. 
Type TTHDFL  
Type TTVS
Type TTHDSX  
Type TTHDSV
V-ﬂat tapered roller bearings (TTHDFL and TTVS) combine the 
best features of thrust tapered and cylindrical roller bearings, 
offering the highest possible capacity of any thrust bearing of its 
size. V-ﬂat design includes one ﬂat ring and the second with a 
tapered raceway matching the rollers. The design was originally 
developed to be screwed down in metal rolling mill applications 
where the thrust loads commonly exceed one million pounds. 
These bearings have exceptional dynamic capacity within a given 
envelope and provide superior static capacity. They are used in 
heavily loaded extruders, cone crushers and other applications 
where a wide range of operating conditions are found.
Most sizes utilize cages with hardened pins through the center 
of the rollers, allowing closer spacing of the rollers to maximize 
capacity. Smaller sizes have cast-brass cages, carefully 
machined to permit full ﬂow of lubricant.
Self-aligning V-ﬂat bearings (TTVS) employ the same basic roller 
and raceway design, except the lower ring is in two pieces, with 
the contacting faces spherically ground permitting self-alignment 
under conditions of initial misalignment. TTVS bearings should 
not be used if dynamic misalignment (changing under load) is 
expected.

feature allows the lubricant to ﬂow between the roller paths, 
through a single lubrication ﬁtting. The lubricant moves laterally 
outward from the center of the bearing, reaching all contact 
surfaces and ﬂushing the bearing. To order, add the sufﬁx W33 
to the bearing number (e.g. 22216EMW33).
Bearings for vibratory applications
Timken offers specific spherical roller bearing designs for

RADIAL CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS 
STANDARD STYLES
Timken® cylindrical roller bearings consist of an inner and outer 
ring, a roller-retaining cage, and a complement of controlled- 
contour cylindrical rollers. Depending on the type of bearing, 
either the inner or the outer ring has two roller-guiding ribs. The 
other ring is separable from the assembly and has one rib or 
none. The ring with two ribs axially locates the position of the 
roller assembly. The ground diameters of these ribs may be used 
to support the roller cage. One of the ribs may be used to carry 
light thrust loads when an opposing rib is provided.
The decision as to which ring should be double ribbed is normally 
determined by considering assembly and mounting procedures 
in the application.
Type NU has double-ribbed outer and straight inner rings. Type N 
has double-ribbed inner and straight outer rings. The use of either 
type at one position on a shaft is ideal for accommodating shaft 
expansion or contraction. The relative axial displacement of one 
ring to the other occurs with minimum friction while the bearing 
is rotating. These bearings may be used in two positions for shaft 
support if other means of axial location are provided. 
Type NJ has double-ribbed outer and single-ribbed inner 
rings. Type NF has double-ribbed inner and single-ribbed outer 
rings. Both types can support heavy radial loads, as well as 
light unidirectional thrust loads. The thrust load is transmitted 
between the diagonally opposed rib faces in a sliding action. 
When limiting thrust conditions are approached, lubrication can 
become critical. Your Timken engineer should be consulted for 
assistance in such applications. When thrust loads are very light, 
these bearings may be used in an opposed mounting to locate 
the shaft. In such cases, shaft endplay should be adjusted at 
time of assembly. 
Type NUP has double-ribbed outer and single-ribbed inner ring 
with a loose rib that allows the bearing to provide axial location 
in both directions. Type NP has a double-ribbed inner ring and 
a single-ribbed outer ring with a loose rib. Both types can carry 
heavy radial loads and light thrust loads in both directions. Factors 
governing the thrust capacity are the same as for types NJ and 
NF bearings.
A type NUP or NP bearing may be used in conjunction with type 
N or NU bearings for applications where axial shaft expansion is 
anticipated. In such cases, the N or NU bearing accommodates 
the shaft expansion. The NUP or NP bearing is considered the 
ﬁxed bearing because the ribs restrict the axial movement of 
the rolling element. The ﬁxed bearing is usually placed nearest 
the drive end of the shaft to minimize alignment variations in the 
drive. Shaft endplay, or ﬂoat, is determined by the axial clearance 
in the ﬁxed bearing.
Types NU, N, NJ, NF, NUP and NP conform to ISO and DIN 
standards for loose rib rings (thrust collars) and typical industry 
diameters over or under roller.  
The cylindrical roller bearing part numbers are in accordance 
with ISO 15. They are composed of four digits, the ﬁrst two digits 
identify the dimensional series and the last two digits of the part 
number are the bore size divided by 5. In the dimensional series, 
the ﬁrst digit is the width series and the second is the diameter 
(outer) series. The width series increase width in the sequence 
8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. The diameter series increase radial section in 
the sequence 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4. 
Types having an R preﬁx are similar in construction to their N 
counterparts. However, they were designed to conform to ABMA 
standards.
Inch-size bearings are identiﬁed by the letter I in the part number. 
RIU, for example, indicates an inch bearing while RU indicates 
the equivalent style in metric dimensions.

5200 METRIC SERIES
This series features enhanced radial load ratings due to its 
internal design proportions. In this series, the outer ring is 
double-ribbed and the inner ring is full-width with a cylindrical 
O.D. The bearing also can be furnished without an inner ring 
for applications where radial space is limited. When so used, 
the shaft journal must be hardened to HRC 58 minimum, and the 
surface ﬁnished to 15 RMS maximum. The W designation in the 
sufﬁx indicates the outer ring is provided. The inner ring also can 
be furnished separately. The A preﬁx indicates that the inner ring 
is furnished either separately or as part of the assembly.
The bearing is usually provided with a rugged stamped-steel cage 
(S designation) and is land-riding on the outer ring ribs. The cage 
features depressed bars, which not only space rollers evenly, but 
retain them as a complete assembly with the outer ring. Cages 
of machined brass (M designation) are available for applications 
where reversing loads or high speeds might indicate their need. 
Outer rings are made from bearing quality alloy steel. The inner 
rings are deep-case hardened to accommodate the hoop stresses 
resulting from heavy press ﬁts.
The standard bearing is produced with radial internal  clearances 
designated as R6. Other internal clearances can be supplied upon 
request. Proper roller guidance is assured by integral ribs and 
roller end clearance control.

EMA SERIES
The Timken® single-row EMA series cylindrical roller bearings 
incorporate a unique cage design, proprietary internal geometry 
and special surface textures. These features help to improve 
bearing performance and can help to improve uptime and reduce 
maintenance costs.  
The cage is a one-piece brass design with full-milled pockets. 
It is a land-riding cage which, unlike traditional roller-riding 
cages, minimizes drag on the roller elements. This reduces heat 
generation and improves bearing life. The high cage rigidity 
allows for more rollers than possible with other brass cage 
conﬁgurations.
Proprietary proﬁles on the rings and/or rollers increase the ability 
to handle heavier loads than competing designs.  
Engineered processes for rings and rollers provide enhanced 
surface textures, resulting in lower friction, lower operating 
temperatures and longer bearing life.
EMA series bearings are available in types N, NU, NJ and NUP.
FULL-COMPLEMENT (NCF)
The full-complement (NCF) single-row bearings include integral 
ﬂanges on the inner and outer rings. These bearings also can 
manage axial loads in one direction and permit small axial 
displacements.

CAGES
Cages (also referred to as rolling element retainers) serve several 
purposes in the proper operation of a rolling element bearing. 
Cages separate the rolling elements and prevent rolling element 
on rolling element contact and wear. Cages align the rolling 
elements on the inner ring to prevent rolling element sliding, 
skidding, and skewing to facilitate true rolling motion. For handling 
purposes, cages retain the rolling elements on the inner ring 
assembly to allow for bearing installation. In some instances, 
cages also improve ﬂow of the lubricant to the bearing raceway 
or rib contacting surfaces.  
The following sections discuss the common types of cages 
used for each major bearing design type (tapered, cylindrical, 
spherical, and ball bearing). The basic design geometry, material, 
and manufacture are discussed for each cage type.
TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CAGES
STAMPED-STEEL CAGES
The most common type of cage used for tapered roller bearings 
is the stamped-steel cage. These cages are mass produced 
from low-carbon sheet steel using a series of cutting, forming 
and punching operations. These cages can be used in high 
temperature and harsh lubricant environments.  
Fig. 39. Stamped-steel cage. 
CAGES
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
28  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
POLYMER CAGES
Cages for tapered roller bearings made of polymer material are 
used primarily for pre-greased and sealed package designs. The 
most common polymer materials used are Nylon thermoplastics 
with glass reinforcement. Polymer cages can be mass produced 
in large quantities and offer more design ﬂexibility than stamped-
steel types. Polymer cages are lightweight and easy to assemble. 
In some instances, increased bearing rating can be achieved 
by allowing one or two extra rollers in the bearing complement. 
Care should be exercised when using aggressive lubricants with 
EP (extreme-pressure) additives in combination with elevated 
temperatures greater than 107° C (225° F).  
MACHINED CAGES
Machined cages for tapered roller bearings are robust in design 
and are suited for high-speed and high-load applications. 
Machined cages use alloy steels and are produced through 
milling and broaching operations. Assembly does not require 
a close-in operation and rollers can be retained using nibs or 
staking. Oil holes also can be easily added for extra lubrication 
for demanding applications. Some designs are silver plated for 
special applications.  
PIN-TYPE CAGES
Tapered roller bearing pin-type cages retain the rolling elements 
by the use of a pin located through an axial hole in the center of 
the roller. Pin-type cages for tapered roller bearings consist of 
two rings with roller pins attached by screw threads at one end 
and welding at the other end. These types of cages are primarily 
used for larger tapered roller bearing designs (greater than 
400 mm [15.7480 in.] O.D.). Pin-type cages are machined out 
of steel and typically allow for an increased number of rolling 
elements. Pin-type cages are restricted to low-speed applications 
(less than 20 m/sec [4000 ft/min] rib speed).

MACHINED-BRASS CAGE
EM, EMB, YM, YMB and YMD bearing cages are precision- 
machined from brass as shown in figs. 44-46. Their rugged 
construction provides an advantage in more severe applications. 
The open-end, ﬁnger-type design permits lubricant to reach all 
surfaces easily, ensuring ample lubrication and a cooler running 
bearing.

SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARING CAGES
STAMPED-STEEL CAGES
The redesigned Timken® EJ bearings incorporate a unique 
stamped-steel cage design. 
The EJ design includes two independent cages, one for each 
row of rollers, which are assembled into an individual bearing. 
This feature serves to prevent cage bending when the operating 
environment is favorable for this to occur.
This cage is guided on the inner ring and runs above pitch. Each 
cage is surface hardened (nitrided) to provide improved wear 
resistance as well as additional strength to allow the bearing to 
operate in even the most severe environment. Face slots have 
been designed for improved lubrication ﬂow. This can result in a 
lower operating temperature and longer bearing life.  
EM, EMB, YM and YMB are all one-piece designs that are 
differentiated by their means of guidance within the bearing. With 
EM and YM designs, the cage mass is low and the rollers are used 
for guidance, while EMB and YMB cage designs typically have 
more mass and guide on the inner ring.
YMD cages are similar to YMB, except they have a two-piece 
design. Two independent cages, one for each row of rollers, are 
assembled into an individual bearing. This allows each row of 
rollers to rotate independently when required by the application, 
and prevents bending of the cage ﬁngers. 
PIN-TYPE CAGES
Large diameter spherical roller bearings can be supplied with 
these cages. Pin-type cages, one for each row of rollers, consist 
of two rings and a series of pins running through the center of 
the rolling element. The design of pin-type cages permits an 
increased roller complement, giving the bearing enhanced load-
carrying ability. Consult your Timken engineer for suggestions on 
the application of this cage.

CAGES
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
30  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
MACHINED CAGES
Machined cages are an option for smaller cylindrical bearing 
sizes, and are typically  made from brass. Machined cage designs 
for cylindrical roller bearings offer increased strength for more 
demanding applications.  
Designs can be one-piece or two-piece cages. One-piece designs 
can be either a ﬁnger-type as shown in ﬁg. 49 or a standard cage 
conﬁguration having fully milled pockets. The one-piece ﬁnger-
type and the two-piece design with cage ring (ﬁg. 50) are more 
common in standard cylindrical roller bearings. They also are 
roller-guided designs.
The one-piece version with fully milled roller pockets (ﬁg. 51) 
is our premium cage. This cage is used with our EMA series 
bearings. Unlike traditional roller-riding cages, it is a land-riding 
cage which minimizes drag on the roller elements. This reduces 
heat generation, resulting in improved bearing life. Compared to 
a two-piece design, this one-piece cage also reduces heat and 
wear by enhancing lubrication ﬂow.  
PIN-TYPE CAGES
Pin-type cages for cylindrical roller bearings consist of two rings 
and a series of pins running through the center of the rolling 
elements. These cages are used for large diameter cylindrical 
roller bearings where machined brass cages are not available. 
With this design, additional rollers can typically be added, 
resulting in increased load capacity.

STAMPED-STEEL CAGES
Stamped-steel cages for cylindrical roller bearings consist of 
low-carbon steel and are manufactured using a series of cutting, 
forming, and punching operations. These cages are made in a 
variety of different designs and are suitable for most general 
purpose cylindrical roller bearing applications. One speciﬁc type 
is the S-type design for the 5200 series cylindrical roller bearing, 
which is a land-riding cage piloted on the outer ring ribs. This 
design has depressed cage bridges which evenly space the 
rolling elements and retain them on the outer ring. Stamped-
steel cages are easily mass produced and can be used in high-
temperature and harsh-lubricant environments.

 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  31
MACHINED PHENOLIC-TYPE CAGES
Cages of this type are a one-piece design and are usually ring 
piloted. The cage is light weight, has oil-absorbing capability, and 
is suitable for high-speed applications. Cages of this type can be 
precisely machined, which reduces inertial ball and cage impact 
forces at high speeds. It does not provide for retention of the balls 
for handling purposes.  
BRASS- AND STEEL-TYPE CAGES
Ball bearing cages made of brass or steel are designed for heavily 
loaded applications. Cage design variations include one-piece 
machined-steel or machined-brass and two-piece riveted cast 
brass. Most designs are ring piloted. Cages of this type also can 
be silver plated for applications requiring high reliability. The 
silver plating provides lubrication at the ball-cage interface during 
start-up to prevent skidding of the balls.

BALL BEARING CAGES
PRESSED-STEEL WELDED CAGES
This cage type consists of two formed 
cage halves welded together. This type 
of cage is standard for most radial non-
ﬁlling-slot ball bearings and provides 
high strength and rigidity as well as good 
uniformity of ball to pocket clearance. 
It is suitable for very high-temperature 
applications, but does not accommodate 
application misalignment.
MOLDED-NYLON FINGER-TYPE CAGES

These types of cages consist of a one-
piece molded design. Rolling elements 
simply snap into place. These cages 
are molded of Nylon 66 which is heat 
stabilized and moisture conditioned. 
This cage type is used in the majority 
of wide inner ring (WIR) ball bearings. 
The polymer can withstand continuous 
operating temperatures up to 120° C 
(250° F) with spikes up to 150° C (300° F) 
and provides a non-corrosive, self-
lubricating material with good resistance to abrasion, wear, most 
solvents, oils, and greases. This cage type can accommodate 
application misalignment. 
Care also needs to be exercised when using aggressive lubrica-
tions with extreme-pressure (EP) additives in combination with 
elevated temperatures greater than 107° C (225° F).  
MOLDED REINFORCED NYLON-TYPE CAGES
These types of cages are one-piece 
outer-ring-piloted or ball guided. Cages of 
this type are molded out of Nylon 66 with 
30 percent glass ﬁber added for moisture 
dimensional stability. The polymer 
can withstand continuous operating 
temperatures up to 120° C (250° F) 
with spikes up to 150° C (300° F) 
and provides a non-corrosive, self-
lubricating material with good resistance 
to abrasion, wear, most solvents, oils, 
and greases.

tions with extreme-pressure (EP) additives in combination with

STRAIGHT BEVEL AND ZEROL GEARING WITH 
ZERO DEGREES SPIRAL
In straight bevel and zerol gearing, the gear forces tend to push 
the pinion and gear out of mesh, such that the directions of the 
thrust and separating forces are always the same regardless of 
direction of rotation (ﬁg. 59). In calculating the tangential force 
(FtP or FtG) for bevel gearing, the pinion or gear mean diameter 
(DmP or DmG) is used instead of the pitch diameter (DpP or DpG). 
The mean diameter is calculated as follows:

DmG =  DpG - b sin G or       DmP  =  DpP - b sinP
In straight bevel and zerol gearing:

FtP = FtG

SPIRAL BEVEL AND HYPOID GEARING 
In spiral bevel and hypoid gearing, the directions of the thrust 
and separating forces depend upon spiral angle, hand of spiral, 
direction of rotation, and whether the gear is driving or driven (see 
ﬁg. 61). The hand of the spiral is determined by noting whether the 
tooth curvature on the near face of the gear (ﬁg. 62) inclines to the 
left or right from the shaft axis. Direction of rotation is determined 
by viewing toward the gear or pinion apex.

SHOCK LOADS
It is difﬁcult to determine the exact effect that shock loading has 
on bearing life. The magnitude of the shock load depends on the 
masses of the colliding bodies, their velocities and deformations 
at impact.
The effect on the bearing depends on how much of the shock is 
absorbed between the point of impact and the bearing, as well as 
whether the shock load is great enough to cause bearing damage. 
It also is dependent on frequency and duration of shock loads.
As a minimum, a suddenly applied load is equivalent to twice its 
static value. It may be considerably more than this, depending 
on the velocity of impact.
Shock involves a number of variables that generally are not 
known or easily determined. Therefore, it is good practice to 
rely on experience. Timken has years of experience with many 
types of equipment under the most severe loading conditions. 
Your Timken engineer should be consulted on any application 
involving unusual loading or service requirements.

BEARING REACTIONS 
For a shaft on two supports, bearing radial loads are determined 
by:
 t Deﬁning the bearing effective spread.
 t Resolving forces applied to the shaft into horizontal and ver-
tical components, relative to a convenient reference plane.
 t Summing moments about the effective center of each of  
the bearing supports, and solving for the radial and axial 
reactions at each support.
EFFECTIVE SPREAD
TAPERED ROLLER OR ANGULAR CONTACT 
BALL BEARINGS
When a load is applied to a tapered roller or angular contact 
ball bearing, the internal forces at each rolling element-to-outer 
raceway contact act normal to the raceway. These forces 
have radial and axial components. With the exception of the 
special case of pure axial loads, the inner ring and the shaft 
will experience moments imposed by the asymmetrical axial 
components of the forces on the rolling elements. The effective 
center for tapered roller bearings is deﬁned as the point at which 
the lines of force normal to the outer ring raceway intersect the 
bearing axis. As an approximation, it also applies to angular 
contact ball bearings. The effective spread is then deﬁned as the 
distance between the bearing effective centers for a two-bearing 
system. It can be demonstrated mathematically that, if the shaft is 
modeled as being supported at its effective bearing center rather 
than at its geometric bearing center, the bearing moment may be 
ignored when calculating radial loads on the bearing. 
Only externally applied loads need to be considered, and moments 
are taken about the effective centers of the bearings to determine 
loads or reactions. 
Fig. 65 shows single-row bearings in a direct and indirect 
mounting conﬁguration. The choice of whether to use direct or 
indirect mounting depends upon the application.
SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
The effective center for each row of spherical rollers intersects 
the shaft axis at the bearing geometric center as shown in ﬁg. 
66. As the distance between effective centers for each row of 
a bearing is zero (i.e. zero moment arm), a pure couple cannot 
be generated internal to the bearing. Therefore, when a shaft 
and housing are misaligned, the inner and outer rings of the 
bearing rotate up to a few degrees relative to each other, 
without creating internal forces. This self-aligning capability in 
turn prevents an external moment load from being supported 
by the bearing. Therefore, spherical roller bearings can only 
accommodate external shaft and housing loads through radial 
and axial reaction forces.

SHAFTS ON TWO SUPPORTS
Simple beam equations are used to translate the externally 
applied forces on a shaft into bearing reactions acting at the 
bearing effective centers.
The following equations are for the case of a shaft on two 
supports with gear forces Ft (tangential), Fs (separating), and Fa 
(thrust), an external radial load F, and an external moment Mo. 
The loads are applied at arbitrary angles (1, 2, and 3) relative 
to the reference plane indicated in ﬁg. 67. Using the principle of 
superposition, the equations for vertical and horizontal reactions 
(Frv and Frh) can be expanded to include any number of gears, 
external forces or moments. For the bearing reaction calculations, 
the gear forces should include the sign (+/-) generated from the 
respective gear force equation.

Care should be used when doing this to ensure proper supporting 
degrees of freedom are used. That is, tapered roller bearings 
and ball bearings support radial loads, moment loads and thrust 
loads in both directions. Spherical roller bearings will not support 
a moment load, but will support radial and thrust loads in both 
directions. Cylindrical roller bearings support radial and moment 
loading, but can only support slight thrust loads depending upon 
thrust ﬂange conﬁguration. 
SHAFT ON THREE OR MORE SUPPORTS
The equations of static equilibrium are insufﬁcient to solve 
bearing reactions on a shaft having more than two supports. 
Such cases can be solved using computer programs if adequate 
information is available. In such problems, the deﬂections of the 
shaft, bearings and housings affect the distribution of loads. Any 
variance in these parameters can signiﬁcantly affect bearing 
reactions.

DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT RADIAL 
BEARING LOADS (Pr)
To calculate the L10 life, it is necessary to calculate a dynamic 
equivalent radial load, designated by Pr. The dynamic equivalent 
radial load is deﬁned as a single radial load that, if applied to the 
bearing, will result in the same life as the combined loading under 
which the bearing operates. For all bearing types, the equation 
takes the following form:

Pr  = XFr + YFa
SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
For spherical roller bearings, the values for Pr can be determined 
using the equations below. Calculate the ratio of the axial load 
to the radial load. Compare this ratio to the e value for the 
bearing.
In equation form,
Pr  = Fr  + YFa             for  Fa / Fr   e, and
Pr  = 0.67Fr  + YFa   for  Fa / Fr  > e.
Values for e and Y are available in the Spherical Roller Bearing Catalog available on 
www.timken.com.
CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
For cylindrical roller bearings with purely radial applied load:

Pr  = Fr 
The maximum dynamic radial load that may be applied to a cylindrical roller bearing 
should be < C/3.
If, in addition to the radial load, an axial load Fa acts on the bearing, 
this axial load is taken into consideration when calculating the life 
of a bearing (with Fa < Faz; Faz is the allowable axial load).

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Tapered roller bearings are designed to carry radial loads, thrust 
loads or any combination of the two. Because of the tapered 
design of the raceways, a radial load will induce a thrust reaction 
within the bearing, which must be opposed by an equal or greater 
thrust load to keep the inner ring and outer ring from separating. 
The induced thrust adds to or subtracts from any externally 
applied thrust loads, depending upon the direction of the applied 
thrust load. As a result, the seated bearing sees the induced thrust 
of the opposing bearing plus the external thrust. The unseated 
bearing sees only its own induced thrust.   
The ratio of the radial to the thrust load and the bearing included 
outer ring angle determine the load zone in a given bearing. The 
number of rollers in contact as a result of this ratio deﬁnes the 
load zone. If all the rollers are in contact, the load zone is referred 
to as being 360 degrees. 
When only radial load is applied to a tapered roller bearing, for 
convenience it is assumed in using the traditional calculation 
method that half the rollers support the load – the load zone is 
180 degrees. In this case, induced bearing thrust is:

The basic dynamic radial load rating, C90, is assumed to be the 
radial load-carrying capacity with a 180-degree load zone in the 
bearing. When the thrust load on a bearing exceeds the induced 
thrust, Fa(180), a dynamic equivalent radial load must be used to 
calculate bearing life.
The equations in tables 7 and 8 provide approximations of the 
dynamic equivalent radial load assuming a 180-degree load 
zone in one bearing and 180 degrees or more in the opposite 
bearing.

For double-row tapered roller bearings, the following table can 
be used. In this table, only bearing A has an applied thrust load. 
If bearing B has the applied thrust load, the A’s in the equations 
should be replaced by B’s and vice versa.
For double-row similar bearing series with no external thrust, 
Fae=0, the dynamic equivalent radial load, Pr, equals FrAB or FrC. 
Since FrAB or FrC is the radial load on the double-row assembly, 
the double-row basic dynamic radial load rating, C90(2), is to be

For all bearings, the maximum contact stress can be approximated 
using the static equivalent load and the static rating.
For roller bearings:
SPHERICAL ROLLER, RADIAL BALL AND 
ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
The load factors Xo and Yo, listed in table 9, are used with the 
following equation to estimate the static radial equivalent load.

Por = Xo Fr + Yo Fa
THRUST BALL BEARINGS 
Similar to radial ball bearings, thrust ball bearings use the same 
equation for equivalent static and dynamic loading.

Poa = Xo Fr + Yo Fa
The X and Y factors are listed in the Thrust Bearing Catalog 
available on www.timken.com along with the minimum required 
thrust load-to-radial load ratio for maintaining proper operation.
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS 
The following equation is used for thrust spherical roller 
bearings:

Poa = Fa + 2.7 Fr
Thrust spherical roller bearings require a minimum thrust load 
for proper operation. Poa should not be greater than 0.5 Coa. If 
conditions exceed this, consult your Timken engineer.

STATIC RADIAL AND AXIAL 
EQUIVALENT LOADS 
To compare the load on a non-rotating bearing with the basic 
static capacity, it is necessary to determine the static equivalent 
load. The static equivalent load is deﬁned as the pure radial or 
thrust load, whichever is appropriate, that produces the same 
contact pressure in the center of the most heavily stressed rolling 
element as the actual combined load. The static equivalent radial 
and/or axial loading is dependent on the bearing type selected. For 
bearings designed to accommodate only radial or thrust loading, 
the static equivalent load is equivalent to the applied load.
DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT THRUST 
BEARING LOADS  (Pa)
For thrust ball, thrust spherical and thrust tapered roller 
bearings, the existence of radial loads introduces complex load 
calculations that must be carefully considered. If the radial load 
is zero, the equivalent dynamic thrust load (Pa) will be equal to 
the applied thrust load (Fa). If any radial load is expected in the 
application, consult your Timken engineer for advice on bearing 
selection.
THRUST ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
For thrust angular contact ball bearings, the dynamic equivalent 
thrust load is determined by:

Pa = Xr F + YFa
The minimum permissible thrust load to radial load ratios (Fa/Fr), 
X factors and Y factors are listed in the bearing dimension tables 
in the Thrust Bearing Catalog available on www.timken.com.
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Thrust spherical roller bearing dynamic loads are determined by:

Pa = 1.2Fr + Fa
Radial load (Fr) of a thrust spherical roller bearing is proportional 
to the applied axial load (Fa) such that Fr  0.55 Fa. The steep 
roller angle induces a thrust load (Fai = 1.2Fr) when a radial load 
is applied. This thrust load must be resisted by another thrust 
bearing on the shaft or by an axial load greater than Fai.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS 
To determine the static equivalent radial load for a single-row 
mounting, first determine the thrust load, (Fa), then use the 
equations in this section, depending on the appropriate thrust 
load condition.
MINIMUM BEARING LOAD 
Slippage can occur if loads are too light and, if accompanied by 
inadequate lubrication, may cause damage to the bearings. The 
minimum load for radial cylindrical and spherical roller bearings 
is Pr = 0.04 C.
Centrifugal force in thrust spherical roller bearings tends to propel 
the rollers outward. The bearing geometry converts this force to 
another induced thrust component, which must be overcome by 
an axial load. This induced thrust (Fac) is given by:

Fac = k n2 x 10-5     (pounds force per RPM)
The bearing data tables do not include static ratings for double-
row bearings. The double-row static radial rating can be 
estimated as:

Co(2)  = 2Co

BEARING RATINGS
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  47
BEARING RATINGS
There are two fundamental load ratings for bearings, a dynamic load rating and a static load rating. 
The dynamic load rating is used to estimate the life of a rotating bearing. Static load ratings are 
used to determine the maximum permissible load that can be applied to a non-rotating bearing.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Published dynamic load ratings for Timken bearings are typically 
based on a rated life of one million revolutions. This rating, 
designated as C, is deﬁned as the radial load under which a 
population of bearings will achieve an L10 life of one million 
revolutions. For Timken tapered roller bearings, the dynamic 
load rating is more commonly based on a rated life of 90 million 
revolutions, with the designation of C90. This rating is the radial 
load under which a population of bearings will achieve an L10 life 
of 90 million revolutions. For tapered roller bearings, the dynamic 
thrust rating also is published and is designated as Ca90. The Ca90 
rating is the thrust load under which a population of bearings will 
achieve an L10 life of 90 million revolutions.
The dynamic load rating of a bearing is a function of the internal 
bearing geometry, which includes raceway angles, contact length 
between rolling elements and raceways, and the number and size 
of rolling elements. It also is a function of material cleanliness.
STATIC LOAD RATING
The basic static radial load rating and thrust load rating for 
Timken bearings are based on a maximum contact stress within 
a non-rotating bearing of 4000 MPa (580 ksi) for roller bearings 
and 4200 MPa (609 ksi) for ball bearings, at the center of contact 
on the most heavily loaded rolling element. 
The 4000 MPa (580 ksi) or 4200 MPa (609 ksi) stress levels may 
cause visible light Brinell marks on the bearing raceways. This 
degree of marking will not have a measurable effect on fatigue 
life when the bearing is subsequently rotating under a lower 
application load. If sound, vibration or torque are critical, or if a 
pronounced shock load is present, a lower load limit should be 
applied. For more information on selecting a bearing for static 
load conditions, consult your Timken engineer.

Tapered roller bearings often use a dynamic load rating based 
on 90 million cycles, as opposed to one million cycles, changing 
the equations as follows:
or
and
or
The traditional form of the equations based on dynamic load ratings 
of one million cycles is most common and will, therefore, be used 
throughout the rest of this section. The dynamic equivalent load 
equations and the life adjustment factors deﬁned in subsequent 
sections are applicable to all forms of the life equation.
With increased emphasis on the relationship between the 
reference conditions and the actual environment in which the 
bearing operates in the machine, the traditional life equations 
have been expanded to include certain additional variables that 
affect bearing performance. The approach whereby these factors 
are considered in the bearing analysis and selection has been 
termed Bearing Systems Analysis (BSA).
The ABMA expanded bearing life equation is:

BEARING LIFE 
Many different performance criteria exist that dictate how a 
bearing should be selected. These include bearing fatigue life, 
rotational precision, power requirements, temperature limits, 
speed capabilities, sound, etc. This section deals primarily with 
bearing life as related to material-associated fatigue. Bearing 
life is deﬁned as the length of time, or number of revolutions, 
until a fatigue spall of 6 mm2 (0.01 in.2) develops. Since fatigue 
is a statistical phenomenon, the life of an individual bearing 
is impossible to predetermine precisely. Bearings that may 
appear to be identical can exhibit considerable life scatter when 
tested under identical conditions. Thus it is necessary to base 
life predictions on a statistical evaluation of a large number 
of bearings operating under similar conditions. The Weibull 
distribution function is the accepted standard for predicting the 
life of a population of bearings at any given reliability level.
RATING LIFE 
Rating life, (L10), is the life that 90 percent of a group of apparently 
identical bearings will complete or exceed before a fatigue spall 
develops. The L10 life also is associated with 90 percent reliability 
for a single bearing under a certain load.
BEARING LIFE EQUATIONS 
Traditionally, the L10 life has been calculated as follows for 
bearings under radial or combined loading, where the dynamic 
equivalent radial load, Pr, has been determined and the dynamic 
load rating is based on one million cycles:

RELIABILITY LIFE FACTOR (a1)
Reliability, in the context of bearing life for a group of apparently 
identical bearings operating under the same conditions, is the 
percentage of the group that is expected to attain or exceed 
a speciﬁed life. The reliability of an individual bearing is the 
probability that the bearing will attain or exceed a speciﬁed life.
The reliability life adjustment factor is:

a1 =   4.26   ln  100   2/3 
+ 0.05
                                                    R

ln =  natural logarithm (base e)
To adjust the calculated L10 life for reliability, multiply by the 
a1 factor. If 90 (90 percent reliability) is substituted for R in the 
above equation, a1 = 1. For R = 99 (99 percent reliability), a1 = 
0.25. The following table lists the reliability factor for commonly 
used reliability values.

Note that the equation for reliability adjustment assumes there 
is a short minimum life below which the probability of bearing 
damage is minimal (e.g., zero probability of bearing damage 
producing a short life). Extensive bearing fatigue life testing has 
shown the minimum life, below which the probability of bearing 
damage is negligible, to be larger than predicted using the above 
adjustment factor. For a more accurate prediction of bearing lives 
at high levels of reliability, consult your Timken engineer.
MATERIAL LIFE FACTOR (a2)
The life adjustment factor for bearing material, a2, for standard 
Timken bearings manufactured from bearing quality steel is 1.0. 
Bearings also are manufactured from premium steels, containing 
fewer and smaller inclusion impurities than standard steels 
and providing the beneﬁt of extending bearing fatigue life (e.g., 
DuraSpexx® bearing). Application of the material life factor 
requires that fatigue life is limited by nonmetallic inclusions, 
that contact stresses are approximately less than 2400 MPa (350 
ksi), and adequate lubrication is provided. It is important to note 
that improvements in material cannot offset poor lubrication in 
an operating bearing system. Consult your Timken engineer for 
applicability of the material factor.
DEBRIS LIFE FACTOR (a3d)
Debris within a lubrication system reduces the life of a roller 
bearing by creating indentations on the contacting surfaces, 
leading to stress risers. The Timken life rating equations were 
developed based on test data obtained with 40 μm oil ﬁltration, and 
measured ISO cleanliness levels of approximately 15/12, which is 
typical of cleanliness levels found in normal industrial machinery. 
When more or less debris is present within the system, the fatigue 
life predictions can be adjusted according to the measured or 
expected ISO lubricant cleanliness level to more accurately 
reﬂect the expected bearing performance.
A more accurate option for predicting bearing life in a debris 
environment is to perform a Debris Signature Analysis™. 
The Debris Signature Analysis is a process for determining 
the effects of the actual debris present in your system on the 
bearing performance. The typical way in which this occurs is 
through measurements of dented/bruised surfaces on actual 
bearings run in a given application. This type of analysis can be 
beneﬁcial because different types of debris cause differing levels 
of performance degradation. Soft, ductile particles can cause 
differing levels of performance degradation than hard, brittle 
particles. Hard, ductile particles are typically most detrimental to 
bearing life. Brittle particles can break down, thus not affecting 
performance to as large of a degree as hard ductile particles. For 
more information on Debris Signature Analysis or the availability 
of debris-resistant bearings for your application, consult your 
Timken engineer.

LOAD ZONE LIFE FACTOR (a3k)
Bearing fatigue life is a function of the stresses between rolling 
elements and raceways as well as the number of stress cycles 
the bearing surfaces experience per revolution. Stresses are 
inﬂuenced by the magnitude of the applied load, the internal 
bearing geometry and the number of rolling elements supporting 
the load. The number of stress cycles is a function of the number 
of rollers supporting the load, which, in turn, is inﬂuenced by the 
number of rollers per row, the bearing geometry, applied load 
and bearing setting.
The arc deﬁned by the rollers supporting the load is called the 
bearing load zone. The load zone is significantly influenced 
by bearing setting or internal clearance, either radial or axial 
depending on the bearing type. Neglecting preload, less clearance 
in a bearing results in a larger load zone and subsequently longer 
bearing life.
The dynamic equivalent load (Pr) is used instead of the applied 
load (Fr) to approximate the combined load zone effect on L10a. 
If a more accurate assessment of the load zone adjusted life is 
necessary (e.g., including the effects of internal clearance or 
ﬁtting practice), consult your Timken engineer.
LUBRICATION LIFE FACTOR (a3l)
The inﬂuence of lubrication ﬁlm on bearing performance is related 
to the reduction or prevention of asperity (metal-metal) contact 
between the bearing surfaces. Extensive testing has been done 
at The Timken Technology Center to quantify the effects of the 
lubrication-related parameters on bearing life. It has been found 
that the roller and raceway surface ﬁnish, relative to lubricant 
ﬁlm thickness, has the most notable effect on improving bearing 
performance. Factors such as bearing geometry, material, 
loads and load zones also play an important role in bearing 
performance.
The following equation provides a method to calculate the 
lubrication factor for a more accurate prediction of the inﬂuence 
of lubrication on bearing life (L10a):

a3l = Cg Cl Cj Cs Cv Cgr
The a3l maximum is 2.88 for all bearings. The a3l minimum is 0.200 
for case-carburized bearings and 0.126 for through-hardened 
bearings.
A lubricant contamination factor is not included in the lubrication 
factor because Timken endurance tests are typically run with a 
40 μm ﬁlter to provide a realistic level of lubricant cleanness for 
most applications.
Geometry factor (Cg)
Cg is given for most part numbers that are available in the bearing 
catalogs on www.timken.com. The geometry factor also includes 
the material effects and load zone considerations for non-tapered 
roller bearings, as these also are inherent to the bearing design. 
However, it should be noted that the primary effect of the load 
zone is on roller load distributions and contact stresses within 
the bearing, which are not quantiﬁed within the lubrication factor. 
Refer to the previous section Load Zone Life Factor (a3k) for more 
information.
The geometry factor (Cg) is not applicable to our DuraSpexx™ 
product. For more information on our DuraSpexx product, consult 
your Timken engineer.

GREASE LUBRICATION FACTOR (Cgr)

LOW-LOAD LIFE FACTOR (a3p)
Bearing life tests show greatly extended bearing fatigue life 
performance is achievable when the bearing contact stresses 
are low and the lubricant ﬁlm is sufﬁcient to fully separate the

test data with sophisticated computer programs for predicting 
bearing performance, Timken engineers developed a low-load 
factor to predict the life increase expected when operating under 
low-bearing loads. Fig. 75 shows the low-load factor (a3p) as a 
function of the lubricant life factor (a3l) and the ratio of bearing 
dynamic rating to the bearing equivalent load.

Fig. 76. Tapered roller bearing contact stress under misaligned 
condition.
MISALIGNMENT LIFE FACTOR (a3m)
Accurate alignment of the shaft relative to the housing is critical for 
bearing performance.  As misalignment increases under moderate 
to heavy loads, high contact stresses can be generated at the 
edges of contact between the raceway and rolling element. Special 
proﬁling of the raceway or rolling element can in most cases offset 
the effects of misalignment as shown in ﬁg. 76. This ﬁgure shows 
the roller-to-inner ring contact stress of a tapered roller bearing 
under a misaligned condition with and without special proﬁling. 
The proﬁling signiﬁcantly reduces the edge stress, resulting in 
improved bearing performance. The misalignment factor takes 
into account the effects of proﬁling on bearing life.
For tapered roller bearings, the base or reference condition upon 
which the bearing rating is generated includes a misalignment of 
0.0005 radians. Above this misalignment value, reduction in life can 
be expected and will be reﬂected in the misalignment factor.
For cylindrical roller bearings, the misalignment factor is also a 
measure of the effect of bearing axial load on life. Axial loading 
of the bearing causes a moment to be generated about the roller 
center, thus shifting the roller-raceway contact stresses toward 
the end of the roller, similar to bearing misalignment. 
Maximum recommended misalignment values for cylindrical roller 
bearings having proﬁled rollers are listed in the following table.

The misalignment factor for spherical roller bearings is 1.0 due 
to the self-aligning capabilities of a spherical roller bearing. The 
allowable misalignment of a spherical roller bearing is between 
0.5 and 1.25 degrees, depending on the bearing series as noted in 
table 13. Life will be reduced if these limits are exceeded.  
Performance of all Timken bearings under various levels of 
misalignment and radial and axial load can be predicted using 
sophisticated computer programs. Using these programs, 
Timken engineers can design special bearing-contact proﬁles 
to accommodate the conditions of radial load, axial load and/or 
bearing misalignment in your application. Consult your Timken 
engineer for more information.

SYSTEM LIFE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAD AND LIFE
BEARING SELECTION PROCESS
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  55
SYSTEM LIFE
System reliability is the probability that all of the given bearings 
in a system will attain or exceed some required life. System 
reliability is the product of the individual bearing reliabilities in 
the system:

R(system) = RA RB RC…. Rn
In the application, the L10 system life for a number of bearings 
each having different L10 life is:

L10(system) = [(1/L10A)3/2 + (1/L10B)3/2 + ….(1/L10n)3/2]-2/3
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE  
AND LOAD EQUATIONS
In many applications, bearings are subjected to various conditions 
of loading, and bearing selection is often made on the basis of 
maximum load and speed. However, under these conditions, a 
more meaningful analysis may be made by examining the loading 
cycle to determine the weighted average load.
Bearing selection based on weighted average loading will take 
into account variations in speed, load, and proportion of time 
during which the variable loads and speeds occur. However, it is 
still necessary to consider extreme loading conditions to evaluate 
bearing contact stresses and alignment.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAD
Variable speed, load and proportion time:

Fwt  =  [(n1 t1 F1 10/3 + ….nn tn Fn 10/3) / na]0.3
Uniformly increasing load, constant speed:

Fwt  =  [(3/13) (Fmax13/3 - Fmin 13/3) / (Fmax - Fmin)]0.3
Use of the weighted average load in the bearing life equation 
does not take into account the effects of different speeds on the 
lubrication factor a3l. For load cycles with varying speeds, it is 
recommended that life calculations be made for each condition 
and that the life for each condition be plugged into the weighted 
average life equation.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE

Lnwt = 1/{[t1 / (Ln)1]+ [t2 / (Ln)2]+… [tn / (Ln)n]}

BEARING TOLERANCES, METRIC AND INCH SYSTEMS
56  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
Ball and roller bearings are manufactured to a number of 
speciﬁcations, with each having classes that deﬁne tolerances 
on dimensions such as bore, O.D., width and runout. In addition, 
bearings are produced in both inch and metric systems with the 
boundary dimension tolerances being different for these two 
systems. The major difference between the two systems is that 
inch bearings have historically been manufactured to positive 
bore and O.D. tolerances, whereas metric bearings have been 
manufactured to negative tolerances.
The following table summarizes the different speciﬁcations and 
classes for ball, tapered roller, cylindrical roller and spherical 
roller bearings. For the purposes of this manual, ISO speciﬁcations 
are shown for ball, cylindrical roller and spherical roller bearings. 
Timken speciﬁcations are shown for tapered roller bearings.
Boundary dimension tolerances for ball and roller bearing 
usage are listed in the following tables. These tolerances are

METRIC SYSTEM
RADIAL BALL, SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Standard Timken® radial ball, radial spherical roller and radial 
cylindrical roller bearings maintain normal tolerances according 
to the current ISO 492 standard. Tables 15 and 16 list the critical 
tolerances for these bearing types. For applications where running 
tolerance is critical, P6 or P5 tolerances are recommended.
The term deviation is deﬁned as the difference between a single 
ring dimension and the nominal dimension. For metric tolerances, 
the nominal dimension is at a +0 mm (0 in.) tolerance. The deviation 
is the tolerance range for the listed parameter. Variation is deﬁned 
as the difference between the largest and smallest measurements 
of a given parameter for an individual ring.

(1)SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.
TAPERED ROLLER BEARING
Metric system bearings (ISO and J Preﬁx Parts)
Timken manufactures metric system bearings to six tolerance 
classes. Classes K and N are often referred to as standard 
classes. Class N has more closely controlled width tolerances 
than K. Classes C, B, A and AA are precision classes. These 
tolerances lie within those currently speciﬁed in ISO 492 with 
the exception of a small number of dimensions indicated in the 
tables. The differences normally have an insigniﬁcant effect on 
the mounting and performance of tapered roller bearings.

Inner Ring Stand. Inner ring 
stand is a measure of the 
variation in inner ring raceway 
size, taper and roller diameter. 
This is checked by measuring 
the axial location of the refer-
ence surface of a master outer 
ring or other type gauge with 
respect to the reference inner 
ring face.

(1)SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.
Runout. Runout is a measure 
of rotational accuracy 
expressed by Total Indicator 
Reading (T.I.R.). Total 
displacement is measured 
by an instrument sensing 
against a moving surface, 
or moved with respect to a 
ﬁxed surface. A radial runout 
measurement includes both 
roundness errors and the 
centering error of the surface 
that the instrument head 
senses against.

(1)For TSL bearings these are the normal tolerances of the inner ring bore. However, bore size can be slightly reduced at large end due to tight ﬁt  
 assembly of the seal on the rib. This should not have any effect on the performance of the bearing.

(1)Stand for ﬂanged outer ring is measured from ﬂange backface (seating face).
(2)These sizes manufactured as matched assemblies only. 
Inner Ring Stand. Inner ring 
stand is a measure of the  
variation in inner ring raceway 
size, taper and roller diameter. 
This is checked by measuring the 
axial location of the reference 
surface of a master outer ring or 
other type gauge with respect to 
the reference inner ring face.
Outer Ring Stand. Outer ring 
stand is a measure of the 
variation in outer ring I.D. size 
and taper. This is checked by 
measuring the axial location 
of the reference surface of a 
master plug or other type gauge 
with respect to the reference 
face of the outer ring.

Runout. Runout is a measure 
of rotational accuracy 
expressed by Total Indicator 
Reading (T.I.R.). Total 
displacement is measured 
by an instrument sensing 
against a moving surface, 
or moved with respect to a 
ﬁxed surface. A radial runout 
measurement includes both 
roundness errors and the 
centering error of the surface 
that the instrument head 
senses against.

     WARNING
Failure to observe the following warnings could 
create a risk of death or serious injury.
Proper maintenance and handling practices are critical. 
Always follow installation instructions and 
maintain proper lubrication.
Never spin a bearing with compressed air. 
The rollers may be forcefully expelled.
To achieve expected bearing performance, it is critical that proper mounting design, ﬁtting 
practices, settings and installation procedures are followed. While there are differences 
between tapered roller, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, radial ball and angular contact ball 
bearings relative to these practices, there are many similarities that apply to all. These similarities 
are summarized in the sections below, followed by a summary of practices speciﬁc to each 
bearing type.
MOUNTING
All bearing types are typically mounted onto a shaft and into a 
housing wherein the shaft and housing have shoulders to back 
the rings. The purpose of the shoulder is to positively establish 
the axial location and alignment of the bearing under all operating 
conditions. Various types of backing shoulder designs can be 
used as shown in ﬁg. 77. The conventional method uses a shoulder 
machined on a shaft or in the housing. In some applications, 
snap rings are used as the shoulder. For either solid shoulder 
or snap ring designs, spacers can be used between the bearing 
raceway and shoulder if necessary. It is essential that a shoulder 
be square with the bearing ring and of sufﬁcient diameter to 
provide adequate backing of the bearing raceway. It also must be 
of sufﬁcient section to resist axial movement under loading, and 
must be wear resistant at the interface with the bearing.
It is highly recommended that roller bearing shaft seats be ground 
to a surface ﬁnish of 1.6 μm (65 μin) Ra maximum. Ball bearing 
seats should be 0.8 μm (32 μin) for shafts under 2 inches and 1.6 
μm (65 μin) for all other sizes.
When shaft seats are turned, a tighter heavy-duty ﬁt should be 
used. The shaft diameter should be turned to a ﬁnish of 3.2 μm 
(125 μin) Ra maximum.
Housing bores should be finished to 3.2 μm (125 μin) Ra 
maximum.

MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  75
FITTING PRACTICE
As a general guideline, bearing rings mounted on a rotating 
member should have an interference ﬁt. Loose ﬁts may permit the 
ring to creep or turn and wear the mating surface and backing 
shoulder. This wear can result in excessive bearing looseness 
and damage to the bearing, shaft or housing.
The choice of ﬁtting practices will mainly depend upon the 
following parameters:
 t Precision class of the bearing.
 t Rotating or stationary ring.
 t Type of layout (single- or double-row bearings).
 t Type and direction of load (continuous/alternate rotating).
 t Particular running conditions like shocks, vibrations, over-
loading or high speed.
 t Capability for machining the seats (grinding, turning or 
boring).
 t Shaft and housing section and material.
 t Mounting and setting conditions.

housing ﬁt selection that conforms to accepted industry standards 
and practices. The bars designated g6, h6, etc., represent shaft/

MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
76  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
SETTING
In the manufacture of rolling element bearings, it is standard 
practice to assemble rings and rolling elements with a speciﬁed 
internal clearance.
Internal clearance is often utilized to compensate for the effects 
of interference ﬁts and thermal expansion of bearings, shafts and 
housings. For some bearing types, it also can provide a desired 
contact angle in the bearing after mounting.
Internal clearance can be measured by either gauging radially 
or axially. Radial clearance is accepted as the typical setting 
characteristic to measure for most bearing types because it is 
more directly related to bearing ﬁts. This is commonly referred 
to as radial internal clearance (RIC). Tapered roller bearings and 
angular contact bearings are the exception as setting in these 
bearings is usually measured in the axial direction.
Correct bearing mounting and ﬁtting practices are key com-
ponents of proper bearing setting.
INSTALLATION
Proper bearing installation, including cleanliness of the 
components, as well as use of proper tools, is critical to bearing 
performance.
Cleanliness of the bearing and mating components is essential 
for a bearing to achieve maximum service life. Burrs, foreign 
material and any raised portions of the components mating with 
the bearing can cause misalignment. Care should be taken to 
avoid these conditions. Shafts and housings, including lubrication 
holes, should be thoroughly cleaned before bearing installation. 
If blind holes are present, insert a magnetic rod to remove metal 
chips that might have accumulated during manufacture. An 
air hose may be used on shafts and housings, but should not 
be used on bearings. Bearings in their shipping containers are 
typically coated with a rust-inhibitive oil. This oil is compatible 
with most lubricants and does not need to be removed prior to 
installation.
Adequate tools must be used to properly ﬁt the inner rings onto 
the shaft and outer rings into the housing to avoid damage. Direct 
shock on the rings must be avoided.
Most applications require a tight interference ﬁt of one or both 
rings. It is acceptable to heat or cool rings to ease assembly. 
Standard bearings should not be heated above 120° C 
(250° F) or cooled below -55° C (-65° F). Precision bearings 
should not be heated above 65° C (150° F) or cooled below 
-30° C (-20° F).
An alternate method of mounting, generally used on smaller 
sizes, is to press the bearing onto the shaft or into the housing 
using an arbor press.
For more information on these installation procedures, please 
contact your Timken engineer.
Speciﬁc mounting design, ﬁtting practice, setting and installation 
recommendations are summarized in the following pages for 
tapered roller, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, radial ball and 
angular contact ball bearings.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  77
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING 
Tapered roller bearings are designed to take both radial and 
thrust loading. Under radial loads, a force is generated in the 
axial direction that must be counteracted. As a result, tapered 
roller bearings are normally adjusted against a second bearing. 
They can be mounted in either a direct or indirect mounting 
arrangement shown in ﬁg. 79. For applications where a direct 
mounting arrangement is used and the outer ring is used to 
adjust the bearing setting, the outer ring is usually set in position 
by an outer-ring follower or mounted in an outer-ring carrier. 
See ﬁg. 80. 
For indirect mountings, bearing setting is typically achieved by 
clamping against one of the inner rings. Various designs, including 
locknuts, stakenuts and end plates as shown in ﬁg. 81 can be used. 
For applications requiring precision-class bearings, a special 
precision nut can be used.
Backing shoulder diameters are listed for tapered roller bearings 
in the Tapered Roller Bearing Catalog on www.timken.com.
FITTING PRACTICE 
General industrial application fitting practice standards for 
inner rings and outer rings are shown in the tables starting on 
page 146. These tables apply to solid or heavy-sectioned steel 
shafts, heavy-sectioned ferrous housings and normal operating 
conditions. To use the tables, it is necessary to determine if the 
member is rotating or stationary, the magnitude, direction and 
type of loading, and the shaft ﬁnish.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
78  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  
Certain table ﬁts may not be adequate for light shaft and housing 
sections, shafts other than steel, nonferrous housings, critical 
operation conditions such as high speed, unusual thermal or 
loading conditions or a combination thereof. Also, assembly 
procedures and the means and ease of obtaining the bearing 
setting may require special ﬁts. In these cases, experience 
should be used as a guideline or your Timken engineer should 
be consulted for review and suggestions.
Rotating inner rings generally should be applied with an 
interference ﬁt. In special cases, loose ﬁts may be considered 
if it has been determined by test or experience they will perform 
satisfactorily. The term “rotating inner ring” describes a condition 
in which the inner ring rotates relative to the load. This may occur 
with a rotating inner ring under a stationary load or a stationary 
inner ring with a rotating load. Loose ﬁts will permit the inner 
rings to creep and wear the shaft and the backing shoulder. This 
may result in excessive bearing looseness and possible bearing 
and shaft damage.
Stationary inner ring ﬁtting practice depends on the application. 
Under conditions of high speed, heavy loads or shock, interference 
ﬁts using heavy-duty ﬁtting practices should be used. With inner 
rings mounted on unground shafts subjected to moderate loads 
(no shock) and moderate speeds, a metal-to-metal or near zero 
average ﬁt is used. In sheave and wheel applications using 
unground shafts, or in cases using ground shafts with moderate 
loads (no shock), a minimum ﬁt near zero to a maximum looseness 
that varies with the inner ring bore size is suggested. In stationary 
inner ring applications requiring hardened and ground spindles, 
a slightly looser ﬁt may be satisfactory. Special ﬁts also may 
be necessary on installations such as multiple sheave crane 
blocks. 
Rotating outer ring applications where the outer ring rotates 
relative to the load should always use an interference ﬁt. 
Stationary, non-adjustable and fixed single-row outer ring 
applications should be applied with a tight ﬁt wherever practical. 
Generally, adjustable ﬁts may be used where the bearing setup 
is obtained by sliding the outer ring axially in the housing bore. 
However, in certain heavy-duty, high-load applications, tight ﬁts 
are necessary to prevent pounding and plastic deformation of 
the housing. Tightly ﬁtted outer rings mounted in carriers can 
be used. Tight ﬁts should always be used when the load rotates 
relative to the outer ring.
To permit through-boring when the outside diameters of single-
row bearings mounted at each end of a shaft are equal, and one 
is adjustable and the other ﬁxed, it is suggested that the same 
adjustable ﬁt be used at both ends. However, tight ﬁts should 
be used if outer rings are backed against snap rings to prevent 
excessive dishing of snap rings, groove wear and possible loss 
of ring retention. Only outer rings with a maximum housing 
ﬁllet radius requirement of 1.3 mm (0.05 in.) or less should be 
considered for a snap ring backing.
Double-row stationary double outer rings are generally mounted 
with loose ﬁts to permit assembly and disassembly. The loose 
fit also permits float when a floating bearing is mounted in 
conjunction with an axially ﬁxed bearing on the other end of 
the shaft.
Fitting practice tables 74-81 on pages 146-159, have been prepared 
for both metric and inch dimensions.
For the inch system bearings, classes 4 and 2 (standard) and 
classes 3, 0, and 00 (precision) have been included.
The metric system bearings that have been included are: classes 
K and N (metric system standard bearings) and classes C, B, and 
A (metric system precision bearings).

Interference ﬁts on thin-walled shafts and light-section steel 
housings have a tendency to collapse the inner ring seat and 
stretch the outer ring seat, resulting in less change in bearing 
setting and overall width. The effects can be calculated 
according to the following formulas.
Inner ring setting reduction/width increase:
Outer ring setting reduction/width increase:
For shaft or housing material other than steel, consult your 
Timken engineer. 
Precision-class bearings should be mounted on shafts and 
in housings which are similarly ﬁnished to at least the same 
precision limits as the bearing bore and O.D. High-quality surface 
ﬁnishes also should be provided. Recommended surface ﬁnishes 
are shown on page 117 for tapered roller bearings and pages 
119-120 for ball bearings. 
Effects of tight ﬁts on bearing setting/width
Interference ﬁts of the inner ring cause inner ring expansion and 
interference ﬁts of the outer ring cause outer ring contraction. As 
the inner ring diameters increase and the outer ring diameters 
decrease, internal clearance within the bearing is reduced and 
bearing width is increased. The change in clearance or setting 
is approximately equal to the change in width.  
For matched assemblies where the setting is pre-set from the 
factory and SET-RIGHT assemblies, the effects of ﬁt must be taken 
into account to provide the desired mounted setting. 
Double-row and four-row bearings that are provided with 
spacers are examples of matched assemblies. These bearings 
are pre-set to a speciﬁc bench endplay or axial clearance prior to 
installation into the application. Mounting the bearing with a tight 
ﬁt will reduce this bench endplay. In order to meet the desired 
mounted setting, the bench endplay must be compensated for 
the ﬁt effect.
SET-RIGHT assemblies rely on the control of bearing, shaft and 
housing tolerances to known distributions, resulting in a statistical 
mounted bearing setting range. This mounted setting takes into 
account any reductions in setting due to tight ﬁts.
Bearing width increase can affect setting in applications such as 
outer-ring-adjusted, direct-mounting designs. In this case, a shim 
is inserted between the outer ring and a backing plate. Tight ﬁts 
will affect calculation of the shim thickness. In other applications 
where axial tolerance summation calculations are made, tight ﬁt 
effects must be taken into consideration.

Axial Endplay
Fig. 84. Internal 
clearance – endplay.
SETTING
Setting is deﬁned as the axial clearance between roller and 
raceway. Establishing the setting at the time of assembly is an 
inherent advantage of tapered roller bearings. They can be set 
to provide optimum performance in almost any application. Fig. 
83 gives an example of the relationship between fatigue life 
and bearing setting. Unlike some types of anti-friction bearings, 
tapered roller bearings do not rely strictly on housing or shaft ﬁts 
to obtain a certain bearing setting. One ring can be moved axially 
relative to the other to obtain the desired bearing setting.
At assembly, the conditions of bearing setting are deﬁned as:
 t Endplay (EP) – An axial clearance 
between rollers and raceways 
producing a measurable axial shaft 
movement when a small axial force 
is applied – ﬁrst in one direction 
then in the other, while oscillating 
or rotating the shaft. See ﬁg. 84.
 t Preload (PL) – An axial interference 
between rollers and raceways such 
that there is no measurable axial 
shaft movement when a small  
axial force is applied – in both 
directions – while oscillating or 
rotating the shaft.
 t Line-to-line – A zero setting 
condition: the transitional point 
between endplay and preload.
Bearing setting obtained during initial assembly and adjustment 
is the cold or ambient bearing setting, and is established before 
the equipment is subjected to service.
Bearing setting during operation is known as the operating 
bearing setting, and is a result of changes in the ambient bearing 
setting due to thermal expansion and deﬂections encountered 
during service.
The ambient bearing setting necessary to produce the optimum 
operating bearing setting varies with the application. Application 
experience or testing generally determines optimum settings. 
Frequently, however, the exact relationship of ambient to 
operating bearing setting is unknown and an educated estimate 
has to be made. To determine a suggested ambient bearing setting 
for a speciﬁc application, contact your Timken engineer.
Generally, the ideal operating bearing setting is near zero to 
maximize bearing life (ﬁg. 83). Most bearings are set with endplay 
at assembly to reach the desired near-zero setting at operating 
temperature. 
There is an ideal bearing setting value for every application. To 
achieve this condition, the bearing setting must take into account 
deﬂection under load (radial + axial) as well as thermal expansions 
and material used.

SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
82  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
MOUNTING
Spherical roller bearings can be mounted individually, but most 
often are mounted in combination with another spherical roller 
bearing or a cylindrical roller bearing.
With spherical roller bearings, typically one bearing is ﬁxed axially 
and the other is mounted with loose ﬁts and axial space. This 
allows movement or ﬂoat for environmental conditions such as 
uneven thermal growth between shaft and housing.
Cylindrical roller bearings can be mounted individually, but most 
often are mounted in combination with another cylindrical roller, 
a spherical roller or a tapered roller bearing.
Fig. 87 shows a typical gearbox application using two spherical 
roller bearings where one bearing is free to ﬂoat and the other 
bearing is ﬁxed axially.
Fig. 88 shows a pulverizer wheel assembly where a double-
row spherical roller bearing is mounted in combination with a 
cylindrical roller bearing. In this application, the cylindrical roller 
bearing allows the shaft to ﬂoat relative to the housing.
Fig. 89 shows a single-reduction gear reducer with herringbone 
gears. A tapered roller bearing is mounted in combination with a 
cylindrical roller bearing on the upper shaft, and two cylindrical 
roller bearings are mounted on the lower shaft.
FITTING PRACTICE
Tables 55 -66 on pages 124-129 list the recommended ﬁtting 
practices for spherical roller and cylindrical roller bearings. The 
tables assume:
 t The bearing is of normal precision.
 t The housing is thick and made from steel or cast iron.
 t The shaft is solid and made from steel.
 t The bearing seats are ground or accurately turned to less 
than approximately 1.6 μm Ra ﬁnish.
The suggested ﬁt symbols are in accordance with ISO 286. For 
help with recommended ﬁtting practices, contact your Timken 
engineer. 
As a general guideline, rotating inner rings should be applied 
with an interference ﬁt. Loose ﬁts may permit the inner rings to 
creep or turn and wear the shaft and the backing shoulder. This 
wear may result in excessive bearing looseness and possible 
bearing and shaft damage. Additionally, abrasive metal particles 
resulting from creep or turning may enter into the bearing and 
cause damage and vibration.

SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  83
Stationary inner-ring ﬁtting practice depends on the loading of the 
application. The load conditions and bearing envelope dimensions 
should be used to select the suggested shaft ﬁt from the tables.
Similarly, rotating outer-ring applications should use an inter-
ference ﬁt between the outer ring and housing.
Stationary outer rings are generally mounted with loose ﬁts to 
permit assembly and disassembly. The loose ﬁt also permits 
axial movement when a spherical bearing is mounted in the 
ﬂoat position.
Thin-walled housings, light-alloy housings or hollow shafts 
must use press ﬁts tighter than those required for thick-walled 
housings, steel, or cast iron housings or solid shafts. Tighter ﬁts 
also are required when mounting the bearing on relatively rough 
or unground surfaces.
Tapered bore designs
Typically, the tapered bore bearings are selected to simplify 
shaft mounting and dismounting. Since the spherical roller 
bearing is not separable, mounting can be simpliﬁed by use of 
an adapter sleeve with a cylindrical bore and tapered O.D. A 
tapered bore roller bearing also can be mounted directly onto 
a tapered shaft.
Bearings with a tapered bore typically require a tighter ﬁt on the 
shaft than bearings with a cylindrical bore. A locknut is typically 
used to drive the inner ring up a tapered shaft sleeve. The locknut 
position is then secured by use of a lockwasher or lockplate. 
Timken offers a wide range of accessories to ease the assembly 
of spherical roller bearings with a tapered bore (see page 89). 
For approximating the clearance loss for axial drive-up, an 85 
percent radial loss approximation can be used. That is, the radial 
clearance loss per axial drive-up can roughly be approximated as 
71 μm/mm for a 1:12 tapered bore and 28 μm/mm for a 1:30 tapered 
bore. Table 41 on page 86 shows the relationship between axial 
displacement of the inner ring and the reduction in RIC (radial 
internal clearance) for tapered bore applications.
SETTING
To achieve appropriate operation clearance, attention must be 
paid to the effects ﬁtting practice and thermal gradients have 
within the bearing. 
Fitting practice
 t An interference ﬁt between the inner ring and a solid steel 
shaft will reduce the radial clearance within the bearing by 
approximately 80 percent of the ﬁt.  
 t Interference ﬁts between the outer ring and steel or cast iron 
housing will reduce radial clearance by approximately 60 
percent.
 t Spherical roller bearings with a tapered bore require a 
slightly greater interference ﬁt on the shaft than a cylindri-
cal bore bearing.  It is critical to select the RIC that allows 
for this reduction.
Thermal gradients
 t Thermal gradients within the bearing are primarily a func-
tion of the bearing rotational speed. As speed increases, 
thermal gradients increase, thermal growth occurs and the 
radial clearance is reduced.
 t As a rule of thumb, radial clearance should be increased for 
speeds in excess of 70 percent of the speed rating.
For help selecting the correct radial internal clearance for your 
application, consult with your Timken engineer.
Radial internal clearance tolerances are listed in tables 40 and 41 
for spherical and cylindrical roller bearings, respectively. 
Spherical and cylindrical roller bearings are ordered with a 
speciﬁed standard or non-standard radial internal clearance 
value. The standard radial internal clearances are designated 
as C2, C0 (normal), C3, C4 or C5 and are in accordance with ISO 
5753. C2 represents the minimum clearance and C5 represents the 
maximum clearance. Non-standardized values also are available 
by special request.
The clearance required for a given application depends on the 
desired operating precision, the rotational speed of the bearing, 
and the ﬁtting practice used. Most applications use a normal or 
C3 clearance. Typically, larger clearance reduces the operating 
load zone of the bearing, increases the maximum roller load, 
and reduces the bearing’s expected life. However, a spherical 
or cylindrical roller bearing that has been put into a preload 
condition can experience premature bearing damage caused by 
excessive heat generation and/or material fatigue. As a general 
guideline, spherical and cylindrical roller bearings should not 
operate in a preloaded condition.

Note: Axial displacement values apply to solid-steel shafts or hollow shafts with bore diameter less than half the shaft diameter. 
For shaft materials other than steel, or for thin-walled shafts, please consult your Timken engineer
(1)This displacement is valid for assembly of tapered bore bearings and is measured starting from a line-to-line ﬁt of the bearing 
bore to the tapered shaft.
(2)1:12 Taper used for 222, 223, 230, 231, 232, 233, 239 series. 1:30 Taper used for 240, 241, 242 series. For sleeve mounting, multiply 
axial displacement values by 1.1 for 1:12 Taper or by 1.05 for 1:30 Taper. For questions on tapered shaft data, consult your 
Timken engineer.

 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  89
Shaft ﬁt (page 124) at 150 mm Bore: ISO p6
From the shaft ﬁt chart at 150 mm nominal bore at p6 (page 136), 
the shaft tolerance is nominal +0.043 to +0.068 mm (+0.0017 
to +0.0027 in.). Therefore, we have the following bore range:

max. shaft  = 150.068 mm (5.0955 in.)

min. shaft   = 150.043 mm (5.0945 in.) 
This yields a shaft ﬁt:

max. ﬁt  
= max. shaft - min. bore 

= 150.068 - 149.075  

= 0.093 mm (0.0037 in.) tight

min. ﬁt  
= min. shaft - max. bore  

= 150.043 - 150.000  

= 0.043 mm (0.0017 in.) tight 
Housing ﬁt (page 125) at 270 mm O.D.: ISO H8
From the housing ﬁt chart at 270 mm nominal O.D. at H8 (page 139), 
the housing bore tolerance is nominal +0.000 to +0.081 mm (+0.0000 in., 
+0.0032 in.). Therefore, we have the following bore range:

max. housing bore = 270.081 mm (10.6331 in.)

min. housing bore  = 270.000 mm (10.6299 in.) 
This yields an O.D. ﬁt:

max. ﬁt  
= max. housing bore - min O.D.  

= 270.081 - 269.965  

= 0.116 mm (0.0046 in.) loose

min. ﬁt  
= min. housing bore - max. O.D.  

= 270.000 - 270.000  

= 0.000 mm (0.0000 in.) loose 
Given bearing number 22328K C3 (140 mm bore with C3 clearance) 
is to be mounted on a tapered shaft. Using a set of feeler gauges, 
RIC is measured at:

RIC = 0.178 mm (0.007 in.)

Suggested reduction of RIC due to installation =   

0.064 to 0.089 mm (0.0025 in. to 0.0035 in.),  

found in the table on page 86.
Calculate the clearance after mounting :

0.178 mm - 0.076 mm = 0.102 mm  
or

0.007 in. - 0.003 in. = 0.004 in.
For this example, the value of 0.076 mm (0.003 in.) was obtained by taking the mid-
range value of the upper and lower limits found in the tables on pages 86-88.
Therefore, the locknut should be tightened until RIC reaches 
0.102 mm (0.004 in.).
It also should be noted that the value obtained by reading the 
suggested RIC after installation directly from the table is 0.056 
mm (0.0022 in.). This differs from the value calculated in the above 
example. The value taken directly from the table is provided as a 
minimum value. It is not suggested to use a calculated value that 
falls below this minimum.
Observations:
 t Bearing 22230YM, nominal 150 mm (5.0955 in.) bore and 270

 t Float bearing position so the stationary O.D. should be free 
to move in housing, or loose ﬁt.
 t With shaft/inner-ring rotation and the moderate loading

SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
For the primary selection of RIC, the major parameters are the 
bearing speed and the ﬁts. For our example, we know that the 
shaft ﬁt is 0.043 mm (0.0017 in.) tight to 0.093 mm (0.0037 in.) tight. 
We know the housing ﬁt is 0 mm to 0.116 mm (0.0046 in.) loose. 
We also know that the bearing speed is 1200 RPM or 60 percent 
of the speed rating.  
As a general rule of thumb, we bump the clearance up to 
operating speeds that exceed 70 percent of the speed rating, due 
to concerns over internal heat generation and thermal growth. 
In this case, we are at 60 percent of the speed rating, so normal 
clearance, ISO C0 or Co, can be selected.
Observing the RIC chart on page 84, we ﬁnd for 150 mm nominal 
bore at Co, the RIC will be 0.110 mm to 0.170 mm (0.0043 in. to 
0.0067 in.).  We also note that the minimum recommended RIC 
(installed) is 0.056 mm (0.0022 in.).
Also from page 83, we note that we get an approximate reduction 
of RIC that is 80 percent of interference ﬁt on a solid shaft and 60 
percent of the O.D. interference ﬁt in a steel or cast iron housing. 
Since we have a loose housing ﬁt, there will be no RIC reduction 
from that ﬁt.
Shaft ﬁt RIC reductions and clearance:
For a 150 mm nominal bore at C3, the RIC will be 0.115 to 0.165 mm 
(0.0045 to 0.0065 in.). Recalculating shaft ﬁt RIC reduction and 
clearance:

max. clearance  
= max. RIC - min. ﬁt reduction  

= 0.165 - 0.034 = 0.131 mm (0.0052 in.)

min. clearance  
= min. RIC - max. ﬁt reduction 

= 0.115 - 0.074 = 0.041 mm (0.0016 in.)
Since the minimum mounted clearance is less than the minimum 
suggested RIC of 0.056 mm (0.0022 in.), the C3 RIC clearance limit 
needs to be reevaluated.

When using a tight-ﬁt inner ring, the method of assembly will depend

Mounting cylindrical bore bearings
Heat expansion method
 t Most applications require a tight interference ﬁt on the shaft.
 t Mounting is simpliﬁed by heating the bearing to expand it 
sufﬁciently to slide easily onto the shaft.
 t Two methods of heating are commonly used: 
-  Tank of heated oil. 
-  Induction heating.
 t The ﬁrst is accomplished by heating the bearing in a tank of 
oil that has a high ﬂash point.
 t The oil temperature should not be allowed to exceed 121° C 
(250° F). A temperature of 93° C (200° F) is sufﬁcient for most 
applications.
 t The bearing should be heated for 20 or 30 minutes, or until it 
is expanded sufﬁciently to slide onto the shaft easily.
 t The induction heating process can be used for mounting 
bearings.
 t Induction heating is rapid. Care must be taken to prevent 
bearing temperature from exceeding 93° C (200° F).
 t Trial runs with the unit and bearing are usually necessary to 
obtain proper timing.
 t Thermal crayons melted at predetermined temperatures 
can be used to check the bearing temperature.
 t While the bearing is hot, it should be positioned squarely 
against the shoulder.
 t Lockwashers and locknuts or clamping plates are then 
installed to hold the bearing against the shoulder of the shaft.
 t As the bearing cools, the locknut or clamping plate should 
be tightened.
 t In cases of outer ring rotation, where the outer ring is 
a tight ﬁt in the housing, the housing member can be 
expanded by heating.
 t The oil bath is shown in ﬁg. 93. The bearing should not be in 
direct contact with the heat source.
 t The usual arrangement is to have a screen several inches 
from the bottom of the tank. Small support blocks separate 
the bearing from the screen.
 t It is important to keep the bearing away from any 
localized high-heat source that may raise its temperature 
excessively, resulting in ring hardness reduction. 

 t Flame-type burners are commonly used. An automatic 
device for temperature control is desirable.
 t If safety regulations prevent the use of an open heated oil 
bath, a mixture of 15 percent soluble-oil water may be used. 
This mixture may be heated to a maximum of 93° C (200° F) 
without being ﬂammable.

Arbor press method
 t An alternate method of mounting, generally used only on 
smaller size bearings, is to press the bearing onto the shaft 
or into the housing. This can be done by using an arbor 
press and a mounting tube as shown in ﬁg. 94.
 t The tube should be made from soft steel with an inside 
diameter slightly larger than the shaft.
 t The O.D. of the tube should not exceed the shaft backing 
diameter given in the Timken Spherical Roller Bearing 
Catalog (order no. 10446), found on www.timken.com.
 t The tube should be faced square at both ends. It should be 
thoroughly clean inside and out, and long enough to clear 
the end of the shaft after the bearing is mounted.
 t If the outer ring is being pressed into the housing, the O.D. 
of the mounting tube should be slightly smaller than the 
housing bore. The I.D. should not be less than the suggested 
housing backing diameter in the table of dimensions  
available in the Timken Spherical Roller Bearing Catalog 
(order no. 10446), found on www.timken.com.
 t Coat the shaft with a light machine oil to reduce the force 
needed for a press ﬁt.
 t Carefully place the bearing on the shaft, making sure it is 
square with the shaft axis. 
 t Apply steady pressure from the arbor ram to drive the  
bearing ﬁrmly against the shoulder.
 t Never attempt a press ﬁt on a shaft by applying pressure  
to the outer ring or a press ﬁt in a housing by applying  
pressure to the inner ring.
Mounting tapered bore spherical roller bearings
 t Use a feeler gage with the thinnest blade of 0.038 mm 
(0.0015 in.). 
 t Place the bearing in an upright position with the inner and 
outer ring faces parallel.
 t Place thumbs on the inner ring bore and oscillate the inner 
ring the distance of two or three roller spacings.
 t Position the individual roller assemblies so that a roller is at 
the top of the inner ring on both sides of the bearing.
 t With the roller in the correct position, insert a thin blade of 
the feeler gage between the roller and the outer ring. 
 t Move the feeler gage carefully along the top roller between 
the roller and outer ring raceway. Repeat this procedure 
using thicker feeler gage blades until one is found that will 
not go through.
 t The blade thickness that preceded the “no-go” blade is a 
measure of RIC before installation.
 t Start the mounting procedure by lubricating the tapered 
shaft with a light coat of machine oil.
 t Slide the bearing onto the shaft as far as it will go by hand.
 t As the locknut is tightened, the interference ﬁt builds up, 
resulting in expansion of the inner ring. 
 t Periodically measure to keep track of the reduction in RIC.
 t Continue the procedure until the proper amount of reduction 
is obtained. Do not exceed suggested amount of reduction.
 t As a ﬁnal check, make sure the remaining RIC equals or  
exceeds the minimum mounted clearance shown in table 41.
 t During mounting, the RIC should be checked at the unloaded 
roller. If this is at the bottom, make sure that the roller is 
raised to seat ﬁrmly at the inboard position of the inner ring.
 t When the suggested amount of RIC reduction has been  
accomplished, the bearing is properly ﬁtted.
 t Complete the procedure by peening the lockwasher tang 
into the locknut slot or securing the lockplate.

ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
MOUNTING 
Like tapered roller bearings, angular contact ball bearings are 
designed to take both radial and thrust loading. Forces are 
transmitted from the inner raceway to the outer raceway along 
a given contact angle, which is deﬁned as the angle between 
the line of action of forces and a radial plane; see ﬁg. 96. 
Forces along this contact angle can be resolved into radial and 
axial components. The axial force must be counteracted. As a 
result, most angular contact bearings are mounted in pairs and 
preloaded against each other to counteract the induced axial 
load from the opposing bearing and to stiffen the assembly in 
the axial direction. 
In the case where an angular contact ball bearing is mounted 
alone, it requires adjustments and must be installed with care. 
As the bearing is relatively loose axially before mounting, it is 
important that the design incorporates some means to move 
the outer ring axially into its correct position relative to the 
inner ring. This adjustment should be made when the bearing 
is mounted. A common method is to place a preloaded spring 
or shims between either the inner raceway and shaft shoulder 
or outer raceway and housing such that the outer raceway is 
seated against the inner raceway.
A duplex bearing is comprised of two single-row bearings that 
are manufactured speciﬁcally for use as a unit. It is analogous 
to a double-row bearing having the same bore and outside 
diameter but twice the single-row width. Duplex bearings may 
be mounted back-to-back, face-to-face or in tandem as shown 
in ﬁgs. 98 -100. The tandem mounting arrangement is used to 
achieve greater thrust-carrying capacity. 
Typical applications for duplex angular contact ball bearings 
include deep well pumps, marine propeller shafts, machine tool 
spindles, speed reducers and elevator worm drives. 
Duplex bearings may be used with spacers to increase bearing 
spread, which in turn increases the resistance to moment 
loading and decreases shaft deﬂection. Shaft and housing 
spacers must be accurately ground to the desired widths to 
ensure that proper preload is maintained. In addition, attention 
should be given to shaft and housing ﬁts, squareness of shaft 
and housing shoulders and alignment of mating parts.

Typical mountings of duplex bearings
Back-to-back mounting, DB or (O)  
(Contact angles diverging toward shaft centerline)
Before mounting, there is clearance between the two adjacent 
inner-ring faces. After mounting, these faces are clamped 
together to provide an internal preload on each bearing. This 
arrangement is well-suited for pulleys, sheaves and in other 
applications where there are overturning loads. It also is suited  in 
all ﬂoating positions where thermal expansion of the shaft occurs. 
It provides axial and radial rigidity and equal thrust capacity in 
either direction when used in a ﬁxed location. Back-to-back is 
the most commonly used of all duplex arrangements.

Face-to-face mounting, DF or (X) 
(Contact angles converging toward shaft centerline)
Before mounting, there is clearance between the two adjacent 
outer-ring faces. After mounting, these faces are clamped 
together between the housing shoulder and cover-plate 
shoulder. This provides an internal preload on each bearing. This 
arrangement provides equal thrust capacity in either direction, 
as well as radial and axial rigidity. 
Since the face-to-face mounting has inherent disadvantages of 
low resistance to moment loading and thermal instability, it should 
not be considered unless a signiﬁcantly more convenient method 
of assembly or disassembly occurs from its use.

Before mounting, the inner-ring faces of each bearing are offset

applied equal to that of twice the normal preload, the inner- and 
outer-ring faces are brought into alignment on both sides. This 
arrangement provides double thrust capacity in one direction

Curves C1 and C2 show the deﬂection of a double-row preloaded 
bearing as shown in ﬁg. 102. Curve C1 represents the bearing 
having a preload of Fa1 and curve C2 represents the bearing having 
a preload of Fa2. Comparing curves C1 and C2 with curve A shows 
the deﬂection of the preloaded pair is much lower than that of the 
unpreloaded bearing.
Curves B1 and B2 show the axial deﬂection of bearing B as 
mounted in ﬁg. 103, from the preloaded conditions Fa1 or Fa2 to a 
non-preload condition.
Preloading can be accomplished by using springs or spacer 
width adjustment, but consult your Timken engineer for design 
review.
FITTING PRACTICE
Recommended shaft ﬁts are listed in table 67 on page 130 for 
7000WN, 7200WU, 7300WN and 7400WN series. This table is to be 
used for applications where only one ring (either inner or outer) 
has an interference ﬁt. In cases where interference ﬁts are used 
for both rings, bearings with a special internal clearance may be 
required. Shaft diameter dimensions are for solid steel shafts. 
Consult your Timken engineer when special ﬁts are required or 
when using hollow shafts.
SETTING
Timken has established standard preload levels that are 
considered proper for most duplex bearing applications. Special 
preloads also can be provided to satisfy extreme requirements. 
For example, a heavily loaded, slow-speed rotating shaft may 
require heavier-than-normal preload in order to minimize 
deﬂection. Although heavy preload provides slightly greater 
rigidity, it reduces bearing life and increases power consumption; 
therefore, preload levels should be chosen with care.
The axial deﬂection of a bearing subject to thrust loading is based 
on Hertz’s theories for elastic bodies in contact. The general 
expression is:
G
 = K     Fa2     1/3

Zd2
A typical axial deﬂection curve for an unpreloaded single-row 
angular contact bearing is shown as curve A in ﬁg. 102. This 
curve represents the deﬂection characteristics of bearing A 
being subjected to thrust load Fa. The amount of deﬂection due 
to load Fa1 is much greater than the increase in deﬂection caused 
by doubling the thrust load to Fa2. This illustrates the non-linear 
deﬂection of a ball bearing.

Radial ball bearings have historically been manufactured to 
standards established by ABEC and ABMA. These standards are 
being phased out and replaced by ISO standards. Table 43 lists 
ABEC standards and the corresponding ISO standard.

Among the tolerance classes, ISO P0/ABEC 1 applies to ball 
bearings made for standard usage. ISO P6, P5, P4, P2 and ABEC 
3, 5, 7 and 9 classes apply to ball bearings of increased precision. 
For purposes of this manual, ISO P0/ABEC1 and ISO P6/ABEC 3 
bearings are covered in this section. The remaining classes 
are covered in the PRECISION BEARINGS section starting on 
page 107.
MOUNTING 
Although radial ball bearings are designed to carry a radial load, 
they perform well under combined radial and thrust loading. 
Radial ball bearings also are suitable for high speeds. As a result, 
they are used in a wide range of applications. Both the Conrad and 
ﬁlling-slot types can be mounted with or without locknuts. They 
also can be ﬁxed or ﬂoating designs, as shown in ﬁg. 104.

The preferred method of locating bearings on shafts and in 
housings is to provide accurate shoulders perpendicular to 
the shaft axis. Shoulders should be large enough to exceed the 
theoretical point of tangency between the corner radius and the 
face of the bearing. They also should be small enough to permit 
bearing removal with proper pullers.
Tables 44-48 list the suggested maximum and minimum shaft 
and housing shoulder diameters for the majority of applications. 
Where design limitations do not permit conformance to these 
suggested diameters, consult your Timken engineer.
Suggested shaft and housing fillet radii are listed in the 
dimensional tables of each product catalog. These must be used 
to assure proper seating against shaft and housing shoulders.

Wide inner ring ball bearings
With wide inner ring ball bearings, a locking collar is used to lock the bearing to the shaft.  Since 
movement of the bearing relative to the shaft is not an issue, a slip ﬁt of the bearing on the shaft 
is recommended. Suggested inner ring bore and shaft tolerances are listed below.  It may be 
permissible to use increased shaft tolerances in some cases. Such cases should be reviewed 
by your Timken engineer.
Bearing bore tolerance: 
1⁄2 in. - 2 3⁄16 in. = nominal to +0.013 mm (+0.0005 in.)
2 1⁄4 in. - 3 3⁄16 in. = nominal to  +0.015 mm (+0.0006 in.)
3 7⁄16 in. - 3 15⁄16 in. = nominal to +0.018 mm (+0.0007 in.)
Shaft tolerances:
1⁄2 in. - 1 15⁄16 in. = nominal to -0.013 mm (-0.0005 in.)
2 in. - 3 15⁄16 in. = nominal to -0.025 mm (-0.0010 in.)

RADIAL BALL BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
104  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
FITTING PRACTICE
Tables 68 and 69 on page 131 provide guidelines for shaft and 
housing ﬁts related to particular operating conditions for ISO 
P0 (ABEC 1) and ISO P6 (ABEC 3) radial ball bearings. Shaft and 
housing tolerance guidelines are shown on pages 132-145. 
SETTING
Correct bearing mounting and fitting practices are key 
components of proper bearing setting. Setting is the amount of 
clearance or interference within a mounted bearing. Bearing 
internal clearance is affected by the tightness of the ﬁt to the 
inner and outer rings. Proper bearing setting is crucial to bearing 
life and performance. Application-dependant factors such as 
load, speed, bearing position, installation method, materials of 
construction, runout accuracy, thermal considerations, hoop 
stress, shaft design and housing design can affect internal 
clearance and should be taken into account when determining 
the bench setting. This section provides tables and discussion 
to aid in selection of the proper bearing mounting and ﬁtting 
procedures to optimize performance in general applications. 
For special applications, please consult your Timken engineer 
for review.
In the manufacture of ball bearings, it is standard practice to 
assemble rings and rolling elements with a speciﬁed internal 
clearance. This characteristic is necessary to absorb the effect 
of press ﬁtting the bearing rings at mounting.
Internal clearance also can be added to compensate for thermal 
expansion of bearings, shafts and housings or to provide a contact 
angle in the bearing after mounting. 
Internal clearance can be measured either by gauging radially 
or axially.
For radial ball bearings, internal clearance is typically measured in 
the radial direction because it is more directly related to shaft and 
housing ﬁts. It also is the method prescribed by the industry. 
The radial internal clearance (RIC) of a radial contact ball bearing 
can be deﬁned as the average outer ring raceway diameter 
minus the average inner-ring raceway diameter minus twice the 
ball diameter.
RIC can be measured mechanically by moving the outer ring 
horizontally, as pictured in ﬁg. 109. The total movement of the 
outer ring when the balls are properly seated in the raceways 
determines the RIC. Several readings should be taken using 
different circumferential orientations of the rings to get a 
comprehensive average reading.

applications involving press ﬁts on both inner and outer rings, 
extra interference ﬁts or temperature differentials.  
Example: P204K.

5
Extra-extra loose; extra large amount of internal clearance 
for applications with large temperature differential and  
interference ﬁts on both rings.

When the inner and outer ring raceway curvatures are accurately 
known, the free endplay can readily be calculated from the values 
of no load radial clearance by the following formula:
E  =      4d[RIC](KO + Ki - 1) - RIC2  or 
  4d[RIC](KO + Ki - 1)

 Where: RIC2 is generally a very small value and can be omitted

 for most calculations without introducing undue inaccuracy. 
The contact angle ( ) is related to internal clearance as follows:

 = sin-1 
E

  2 (Ko + Ki - 1) d 
Where: d is ball diameter.

 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  105
Endplay (axial clearance)
Endplay is an alternate method of measuring internal clearance 
and is rarely used except for certain special applications. 
Endplay is determined by mounting the bearing, as shown in ﬁg. 
110, with one of its rings clamped to prevent axial movement. A 
reversing measuring load is applied to the unclamped ring so that 
the resultant movement of that ring is parallel to the bearing axis. 
Endplay is the total movement of the unclamped ring when the 
load is applied ﬁrst in one direction and then in the other.

PRECISION BEARINGS
MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  107
PRECISION BEARINGS 
MOUNTING
Machine tools are a common application for precision bearings 
and are provided as typical examples in the following discussions. 
Common terminology within the machine tool industry is to refer to 
the shaft as the spindle. In keeping with this industry preference, 
the term spindle is used in the PRECISION BEARINGS section of 
this manual.
Obtaining good spindle accuracy depends not only on selecting 
the proper precision bearings but also on the following factors:
 t Good design and machining of the components that support 
the bearing (roundness and alignment of the seats, square-
ness of backing shoulders of both the spindle and the  
housing, and surface ﬁnish).
 t Correct use of information provided with bearings.
 t Correct ﬁtting practices.
 t Appropriate bearing setting.
Selection of the most appropriate mounting design is largely 
dictated by requirements for stiffness, speed capability and ease 
of assembly.
Design and accuracy of mounting surfaces
The total runout of a spindle bearing housing system is a 
combination of the runout of each component. A precision bearing 
ring will assume the shape of the spindle or housing to which it is 
mounted and will transmit any runout to the system. In machine 
tool applications, runout from the housing, spindle and bearing 
is transmitted to the workpiece. Therefore, particular attention 
needs to be paid to the design and accuracy of the mounting 
surfaces.
The primary function of the inner- or outer-ring seat and abutment 
is to positively establish the location and alignment of the bearing 
under all loading and operating conditions. To achieve optimum 
bearing performance, it is essential to design housing seats and 
abutments that are round and that are square in alignment with the 
spindle axis. Shoulders must be of sufﬁcient section and design 
to resist axial deﬂection under load. 
Housing design
Housings are usually made of cast iron or steel and are generally 
heat-treated to lessen possible distortion. For smaller, high-speed 
applications, steel housings are preferred.
The bore of the housing should be ground or bored and checked 
at a number of points throughout its length and diameter to ensure 
that it is round and does not taper.
It is preferable to mount the bearings in one casting; this permits 
machining the two housing bores in one setting, as well as 
accurate alignment of the bearings.
In many cases, it is advantageous to employ a steel sleeve 
between the outer ring of the bearing and the housing, thus 
allowing assembly of the bearings on the shaft and insertion of the 
entire unit into the sleeve. This method also provides a surface of 
proper hardness when housings are made of a material that has 
a low Brinell value, such as aluminum and other soft metals.
Shaft shoulders and housing shoulders should be square and 
true, and should be of such diameters as to meet the suggestions 
shown with the part numbers given. The choice between ﬁllets 
and undercut reliefs rests with the individual shaft design and 
conditions surrounding its normal use. 
Where screws are used to fasten end caps into the main housing, 
adequate section should be left between the screw hole and the 
housing bore. This is required to prevent distortion of the housing 
bore when the screws are tightened and the covers or other parts 
are pulled tightly into place.
Prior to assembly, shafts and housings, as well as all lubricant 
holes and channels, should be cleaned thoroughly to remove all 
debris that may be carried by the lubricant into the bearings and 
cause bearing damage.
Housing seals
A labyrinth combination of ﬂinger and end cover provides a highly 
effective seal against the intrusion of foreign matter. This seal 
is suggested for use over a wide range of speeds. For slower-
speed applications, a combination of ﬂinger and a commercial 
contact-type seal is usually employed.
Flingers should be machined all over to assure true running. 
Their diameters should be concentric with the bore. The outside 
diameter of the ﬂinger is often tapered to throw off cutting 
compounds, coolants, etc., from the point at which such liquids 
may enter the spindle. A drip or run-off groove adjacent to the 
open lip of the end cover is desirable and practical.
The axial clearances of the internal faces between ﬂinger and 
end cover should be about 1.600 mm (0.0629 in.). The ﬁrst radial 
clearance opening on any design through which liquid may pass 
should be made very close, about 0.089 mm (0.0035 in.) per side. The 
inner radial clearances should be between 0.380 mm (0.0149 in.) and 
0.190 mm (0.0075 in.).

Shafts
Shafts are preferably made from hardened and ground steel; 
and, where suitable, a hardness of 45-50 HRC is recommended. If 
possible, bearing backing shoulders and seats should be ground in 
one operation. This promotes true balance and running accuracy, 
which are critical in high-speed applications. Suggested shaft 
geometry can be found on page 119.
Locking devices
In most cases, simple 2TS(F) spindle layouts are adjusted by 
correct positioning of the rear bearing inner ring. A commonly 
used device is a precision adjusting nut. A locking device must 
be provided to properly maintain the nut after setting: either 
axially by means of two screws 180 degrees opposite pinching 
the threads (ﬁg. 111a), or radially by pressure of a screw on a soft 
metal shoe (ﬁg. 111b).
For improved accuracy, a ground spacer in conjunction with a 
square-ground spindle shoulder and a locking precision nut also 
can be used (ﬁg. 112). Good parallelism of the ground-spacer 
faces as well as the squareness of the spindle shoulder will 
ensure ﬁnal position of the nut abutment face is tightly controlled 
resulting in proper position of the inner ring backface. This 
mounting conﬁguration also offers assurance that the initially 
deﬁned setting cannot be modiﬁed by the ﬁnal user. Fig. 111c 
shows two different solutions with ground spacers. Note the 
practicality of the above centerline solution, which allows the 
spacer to both increase or decrease the initial setting.
A well-known method of providing good spindle alignment, 
roundness and backing squareness is to grind the inner ring seats 
and the backing shoulders during the same operation (ﬁg. 113). 
In this method, the grinding of the adjusting nut (if any) abutment 
face also can be achieved by locking the nut on its thread. This 
eliminates possible misalignment of the nut due to internal thread 
clearance.

TS and TSF arrangement 
The spindle is supported by one bearing at the nose position 
and a second one at the rear position. This layout offers the 
advantage of being a simple design that allows easy machining 
of adjacent parts. Mounting and setting can be easily achieved 
with standard tooling. 
Stiffness calculations of the spindle-bearing system allow the 
optimum bearing spread to be determined precisely for each 
mounting, as a function of the overhung value of the spindle nose. 
A good approximation, however, is to consider that the distance 
between bearing centers should be two and a half to three 
times the spindle nose diameter. This represents an optimum 
value not only for stiffness, but for thermal expansion.

using appropriate jets for oil inlets and cooling.

A typical spindle arrangement is the combination of a Hydra-Rib

bearing is ﬁtted at the rear position and the TS bearing at the 
nose position of the spindle. The outer-ring rib simpliﬁes the 
lubrication at high speed since the natural ﬂow of the oil under 
centrifugal effect feeds the oil to the rib. A simple axial oil inlet 
above the cage on the small roller end is therefore sufﬁcient for 
lubricating the Hydra-Rib bearing.

Tandem mounting, DT
Before mounting, the inner-ring faces of each bearing are offset 
from the outer ring faces. After mounting, when an axial load is 
applied equal to that of twice the normal preload, the inner and 
outer-ring faces are brought into alignment on both sides. This 
arrangement provides double axial capacity in one direction 
only. More than two bearings can be used in tandem if additional 
axial capacity is required. 
Other mountings
Flush-ground (DU) pairs may be mounted in combination with a 
single ﬂush-ground bearing as a triplex (TU) set shown below. 
Also shown below is a quadruplex (QU) set where three bearings 
in tandem are mounted back-to-back with a single bearing. 
These arrangements provide high capacity in one direction and 
also a positively rigid mounting capable of carrying a moderate 
amount of reverse thrust.

arrangement is well-suited for pulleys, sheaves and other 
applications where there are overturning loads and also all 
ﬂoating positions where thermal expansion of the shaft occurs. 
It also provides axial and radial rigidity and equal axial capacity

Back-to-back versus face-to-face mountings
Mountings having bearings applied in any of the face-to-face 
(DF) arrangements are objectionable because they provide 
the least rigidity. Furthermore, when the operating speeds are 
comparatively high, such mountings may build up bearing preload 
excessively because of the temperature gradient between the 
housings, bearings and shafts. As this gradient increases, the 
bearing preload builds up, starting a detrimental cycle that may 
lead to premature spindle damage.
In machined mountings, the spindle temperature usually 
changes at a faster rate than the housing temperature, creating 
temperature differentials between the two members. This is due 
to the exposed housing having the ability to expel more heat. 
Thus, the spindle and the inner-ring spacer expand at a faster 
rate than the housing and the outer-ring spacer. As the spindle 
expands longitudinally and the inner-ring spacer lengthens, an 
axial load builds up on each bearing and continues to increase 
until the equilibrium temperature is reached. This occurs when 
the mean housing temperature levels off and the heat transferred 
from the bearings balances the heat generated within the system. 
Therefore, if the housing attains an excessively high temperature, 
the initial bearing temperature is built up considerably.
In a face-to-face mounting, ﬁg. 127, the shaft expands radially 
and longitudinally and the inner-ring spacer lengthens, but at a 
faster rate than the outer-ring spacer. This thermal expansion 
causes an additional axial load to be imposed on both inner 
rings, increasing the preload of the bearings. Conversely, in 
back-to-back mounting, ﬁg. 128, the longitudinal expansion of 
the inner-ring spacer tends to relieve, rather than build up, the 
bearing preload.
The two back-to-back pairs, shown in ﬁg. 129, are mounted so 
that the two middle bearings are face-to-face. As previously 
observed, temperature gradients cause the preload of these inner 
bearings to increase during operation. This mounting operation 
is not suggested. In bearing mountings of the system seen in 
ﬁg. 130, undue axial loads are put on the two outer bearings 
as the temperature along the shaft becomes higher than at 
the housing. The two inner bearings unload, starting a vicious 
cycle of increasing temperature, preload buildup and lubricant 
breakdown. This also is an unfavorable mounting arrangement 
and is not suggested. The same bearings are shown correctly 
mounted in tandem and arranged back-to-back in ﬁg. 131. Lateral 
expansion of the shaft and inner-ring spacer of such mountings 
increases neither axial loading nor bearing preload.
Therefore, to prevent increases in preload due to the thermal 
expansion, back-to-back mountings are preferred for bearings 
on machine tool spindles. When two pairs are used, each pair 
should be mounted in tandem, but the combination should be 
arranged back-to-back as in ﬁg. 131.

MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
Spring-loaded mountings
For high-speed applications such as machine tools, radial and 
axial rigidity and smooth spindle performance may be obtained 
by spring loading the ball bearings with a predetermined 
axial load. Spring loading allows the spindle to ﬂoat laterally 
during temperature changes without appreciably increasing or 
decreasing the original spring axial load.
As the inner ring heats up during operation, it expands radially. 
This radial expansion applies an increasing load through the 
rolling elements and outer ring and ﬁnally to the preload springs. 
The preload springs deﬂect slightly to compensate for the loads 
due to thermal expansion and maintain a consistent load on the 
spindle system.
In some applications, single spring-loaded bearings are employed 
at the front and rear locations, mounted in back-to-back 
arrangement. Other mountings, similarly spring-loaded, have a 
pair of bearings installed in tandem at each end of the spindle 
in back-to-back arrangement (DT-DB). In either case, the spring 
pressure is applied to the pulley-end or rear bearing position, 
placing the shaft in tension between the two bearing locations.
High points of runout
Most precision ball and tapered roller bearings have the high 
point of radial runout marked on the inner and outer rings.  These 
high points can be aligned to optimize accuracy of the spindle / 
housing system. The components should be mounted in the 
housing and on the spindle so that the high points are aligned 
with each other. In other words, the inner rings are ﬁtted on the 
spindle so the high point of the rear ring is aligned with the high 
point of the nose ring. Similarly, the high points of the outer rings 
are aligned in the housing.
To obtain maximum precision, and when the high points of runout 
of both the spindle and the housing are known, the respective 
high points of the bearing components should be 180 degrees 
opposite to those of the spindle and the housing. This will tend 
to neutralize the eccentricity and minimize the effect of the high 
spots of all components. The ﬁgures to the right show typical 
examples of the correct and incorrect use of the high point of 
runout of bearings.
Greater accuracy can be achieved by grinding the spindle nose 
after the bearings are installed. This procedure will produce 
spindle runout considerably lower than the bearing runout.

FITTING PRACTICES
General guidelines for tapered roller bearings
The tapered roller bearing design permits the setting to be 
achieved during installation (or during running when using a 
Hydra-Rib), irrespective of the inner- and outer-ring ﬁts on shaft 
and housing. This allows the use of the widest possible machining 
tolerances for shaft and housing and the use of the best possible 
ﬁts for the inner rings and outer rings to match the duty of the 
bearing.
The ﬁtting practice will depend upon the following parameters:
 t Precision class of the bearing.
 t Type of layout.
 t Type and direction of loads.
 t Running conditions (vibration, speed, temperature 
differential).
 t Shaft and housing sections and materials.
 t Mounting and setting conditions.
Certain table ﬁts may not be adequate for light shaft and housing 
sections, shafts other than steel, nonferrous housings, critical 
operation conditions such as high speed, unusual thermal or 
loading conditions or a combination thereof. Also, assembly 
procedures and the means and ease of obtaining the bearing 
setting may require special ﬁts. In these cases, experience 
should be used as a guideline or your Timken engineer should 
be consulted for review and suggestions.
Precision class bearings should be mounted on shafts and in 
housings that are similarly ﬁnished to at least the same precision 
limits as the bearing bore and O.D. 
In the machine-tool industry, where the majority of application 
shafts rotate, the general rule is to tight ﬁt both the inner rings 
and outer rings for simple layouts to eliminate any undesirable 
radial clearance.
Non-ferrous housings
Care should be taken when pressing outer rings into aluminum 
or magnesium housings to avoid metal pickup. This may result in 
unsatisfactory ﬁts, backing, and alignment from debris trapped 
between the outer ring and backing shoulder. It is recommended 
that the outer ring be frozen and/or the housing heated, during 
assembly. Also, a special lubricant may be used to ease assembly. 
In some cases, outer rings are mounted in steel inserts that are 
attached to the aluminum or magnesium housings. Table ﬁts 
may then be used. Where the outer ring is ﬁtted directly into an 
aluminum housing, it is suggested that a minimum tight ﬁt of 1.0 μm 
per mm (0.0010 in. per in.) of outer ring outside diameter be used. 
For a magnesium housing, a minimum tight ﬁt of 1.5 μm per mm 
(0.0015 in. per in.) of outer ring outside diameter is suggested.

 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  117
Shaft and housing considerations  
tapered roller bearings
In general, machining bearing seats and shoulders in spindles and 
housings require careful consideration of the following form and 
orientation characteristics. The ﬁrst four characteristics apply 
to the seats of bearing rings.
 t Circularity (roundness) of each seat at every cross section.
 t Cylindricity of each seat. Cylindricity includes the taper, 
roundness and other form characteristics of the seat.
 t Coaxiality of the inner-ring seats on the spindle and 
coaxiality of the outer ring seats in the housing. Coaxiality 
includes offset misalignment and angular misalignment 
between seats.
 t Angularity of each bearing ring seat. This is a consideration 
when a inner ring seat is tapered.
The following two characteristics apply to the shoulders 
corresponding to each bearing seat.
 t Perpendicularity (squareness) of each shoulder to its cor-
responding bearing seat, or as a more practical measure, 
perpendicularity of each shoulder to the spindle or housing 
centerline established from the two bearing seats.
 t Flatness of each shoulder. A practical way of assessing the 
combined perpendicularity and ﬂatness of each shoulder is 
to measure the total runout of the shoulder relative to the 
spindle or housing centerline. The runout of the face of the 
adjusting nuts, if used, should also be measured.
The tolerances to which these characteristics should be held are 
dependent upon the class, size and application of the bearing. 
In general, these tolerances should be no greater than the total 
indicator reading (T.I.R.) of the assembled bearing.
Some of the characteristics can be difﬁcult to measure precisely. 
The individual user may elect to measure a subset of these 
characteristics (roundness and taper as an alternative to 
cylindricity). The individual user must determine the degree of 
effort and expense to be invested in the measurements. That 
determination should be based on the intended application of 
the bearing and the level of conﬁdence in the machining process 
employed to manufacture the spindle and housing.
Surface ﬁnishes – precision bearings
Precision class bearings should be mounted on shafts and in 
housings that are ﬁnished to at least the same precision limits 
as the bearing bore or outside diameter.
Furthermore, high-quality surface ﬁnishes together with close 
machining tolerances of bearing seats also must be provided 
as shown in table 52.

MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE, SETTING AND INSTALLATION
118  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
Ball bearings
Shaft ﬁts 
The main purpose of the shaft ﬁt is to assure a proper attachment 
of the inner ring to the shaft. Under normal conditions of shaft 
rotation, a loosely ﬁtted inner ring will creep on the shaft, leading 
to wear and fretting. This condition will be further aggravated by 
increase of load or speed. To prevent creeping or slipping, the 
inner ring should be mounted ﬁrmly in place and held securely 
against the shaft shoulder. However, it is important that the 
shaft ﬁt should not result in any undue tightening of the bearing. 
An excessive interference ﬁt of the bearing bore with the shaft 
could result in a proportionate expansion of the bearing inner 
ring, which could disturb the internal ﬁt of the bearing and lead 
to heating and increased power consumption. 
As a general rule, it is suggested that the shaft size and tolerance 
for seating super precision ball bearings (ISO P4/ABEC 7 and 
ISO P2/ABEC 9) be the same as the bearing bore. In the case 
of preloaded bearings, the suggested shaft ﬁt is line-to-line, 
since an excessively tight ﬁt expands the bearing inner ring and 
increases the bearing preload, which can lead to overheating. 
For example, a duplex pair of 2MM9111WI DUL bearings with 
16 kg (35 lbs.) built-in preload, when mounted on a shaft that 
provides an interference ﬁt of 0.010 mm (0.0004 in.), will increase 
the preload to approximately 86 kg (180 lbs.), which could result 
in elevated operating temperatures.

Housing ﬁts
Under normal conditions of a rotating shaft, the outer ring is 
stationary and should be mounted with a hand push to a light 
tapping ﬁt. Should the housing be the rotating member, the same 
fundamental considerations apply in mounting the outer ring as 
in the case of an inner ring mounted on a rotating shaft. Contact 
your Timken engineer for outer-ring rotation requirements.
As a general rule, the minimum housing bore tolerance for super 
precision ball bearings should be the same as the maximum 
bearing outside diameter tolerance. If the bearing O.D. tolerance 
is 0.008 mm (0.0003 in.), the housing bore tolerance should be 
0.008 mm (0.0003 in.).

Suggested shaft and housing geometry tolerances for precision 
ball bearings are listed on pages 119-120.
To accomplish the optimum mounting condition, it is important 
to follow the tabulated tolerances, except when deviations are 
suggested by your Timken engineer. It is equally important that 
all shaft and housing shoulders be square and properly relieved 
to assure accurate seating and positioning of the bearings in 
the mounting.
On high-speed applications where nearby heat input is along 
the shaft, it is extremely important that the ﬂoating bearings can 
move axially to compensate for thermal expansion. Ball bearings 
cannot ﬂoat axially if they are restricted by tight housing bores or 
by the radial expansion of the bearing itself due to temperature 
differentials. Therefore, in such cases, the suggested housing 
mounting ﬁt for the ﬂoating bearing is slightly looser than the 
tabulated average ﬁt.
Likewise, in spring-loaded ball bearing applications, the housing 
mounting ﬁt must be free enough to permit axial movement of 
the bearing under the spring pressure during all conditions of 
operation. The suggested housing dimensions to ensure proper 
ﬂoat of the bearings under average conditions are listed in the 
Timken Super Precision Bearings for Machine Tool Applications 
Catalog (order no. 5918) found on www.timken.com.

SETTING AND PRELOADING GUIDELINES
Tapered roller bearings
The operating setting of a bearing system has a direct inﬂuence 
on the operating temperature, dynamic stiffness, system accuracy 
or runout and bearing life. An example of a precision bearing 
application where setting is critical is machine tools. Spindle 
accuracy affects cutting performance and therefore maintaining 
optimum setting is critical.
Slight preload is generally the optimum operating setting for 
applications using TS or TSF bearings. In order to determine 
the cold-mounted setting that will provide the desired operating 
setting, the parameters that inﬂuence operating setting must be 
evaluated. These include:
 t Rotating speed.
 t Applied loads.
 t Bearing conﬁguration and spread.
 t Lubrication type and ﬂow.
 t External heat sources.
Many of these parameters directly and interactively affect 
operating temperature which, in turn, affects bearing setting. 
If possible, it is best to evaluate these effects by conducting 
lab tests on the application. Temperature readings at various 
locations can conﬁrm or provide additional input for the analysis 
tools.     
A temperature gradient typically exists across the bearing due 
to the fact that the inner ring generates more heat than the outer 
ring. The inner and outer ring temperatures are transmitted to 
the shaft and housing. The temperature gradient between the 
shaft and the housing is typically 2° C to 5° C (4° F to 9° F).  It is 
valid for any type of bearing and has a direct inﬂuence on the 
bearing setting. 
In the case of pure radial bearings, such as cylindrical roller 
bearings, the radial setting will vary proportionally to the radial 
temperature gradient without any possibility for correction. 
The use of tapered roller bearings allows the radial loss of endplay 
due to the gradient between the spindle and the housing to be 
compensated by the axial expansion of the spindle with respect 
to the housing through optimization of the bearing spread.
While temperature effects on setting are important, it also is 
necessary to consider the effects of bearing conﬁguration and 
spread on operating setting. Steps can be taken to optimize the 
design so that the setting change is minimal during operation. Fig. 
133 shows a graphical representation of optimum spread. 
The following formula can be used to calculate the effect on 
operating setting for a given bearing spread. Fig.134 deﬁnes some 
of the variables used in the formula.

Loss of endplay = 12 x 10-6  ΔT [ (

Fig. 136. System setting and temperature vs. time: 

a) Two-support mounting. 

b) Three-support mounting.
During the starting period, care must be taken because the radial 
thermal expansion is not immediately compensated by the axial 
expansion of the spindle. That occurs later. During this transient 
period, a decrease of the axial endplay or an increase of preload 
is generally recorded (ﬁg. 136). The loss of endplay can be 
calculated by using the same formula on page 121, but ignoring 
the parameter L. For this reason, it is generally recommended to 
initially set the bearings with a light, cold endplay to avoid any 
bearing burn-up, due to excessive preload during the transient 
temperature rise. During the testing phase, it will be possible to 
modify this initial endplay to obtain the optimum setting for the 
application.
Fig. 136 shows that a three-support arrangement is more sensitive 
to thermal effects, leading to a higher temperature rise and loss of 
endplay than a simple arrangement because of the short bearing 
geometric spread at the ﬁxed position (ﬁg. 135).

Ball bearings
Precision ball bearings are designed to operate under a range 
of settings, from light endplay to heavy preload. Most commonly, 
they are designed to run in a preloaded condition.  
Preloading is achieved for the different ball bearing mounting 
arrangements as described on page 113 and depicted in ﬁgs. 
123-126. When the bearings are clamped, any initial clearance 
of the bearings is removed and an axial force is created within 
the bearing that brings the balls into contact with their respective 
raceways, resulting in compressive forces on the raceways. 
Under this condition, the bearing stiffness increases, thereby 
decreasing axial and radial deﬂections when application loads 
are applied to the bearing assembly.  
The optimum setting for a given application is dependant upon 
the stiffness, life and operating speed requirements. These 
requirements are often in conﬂict when it comes to deﬁning 
the best setting. For example, stiffness increases with preload 
while speed capability decreases with preload. High preload 
reduces the range of operating speeds by causing bearings to 
run hotter as speed increases, resulting in reduced bearing life. 
If high speed and high rigidity are required, the effects of preload 
on each of these parameters must be evaluated. Compromise 
between stiffness and speed capacity may be necessary.  In other 
applications, bearing life may be critical. Life typically increases 
with increasing preload up to a certain point, then drops off rapidly 
under heavy preload.  
Three classes of ball bearing preload are commonly used – light, 
medium and heavy.  Selection of the appropriate preload is based 
on speciﬁc application requirements. Preload values for these 
preload classes are listed in the dimension tables in the Timken 
Super Precision Bearings for Machine Tool Applications Catalog 
(order no. 5918) found on www.timken.com.
Axial deﬂection curves of various preload conditions for duplex 
pairs of 15-degree contact angle super precision ball bearings are 
shown in ﬁg. 137, and the radial deﬂection curves for the same 
bearings are shown in ﬁg. 138.

Spherical roller bearing s4 ﬁts 
A centrifugal force load produces a rotating outer ring load and 
a stationary inner ring load, even though the inner ring rotates. 
This makes it desirable to ﬁt the outer ring tight in the housing 
(using a P6 ﬁt as shown in table 73), and the inner ring loose on 
the shaft using an s4 ﬁt as listed in table 57. The standard W33 
bearing with oil grooves and oil holes can be used.
The s4 ﬁt designation as referenced on this page is a special 
ﬁt tolerance developed by The Timken Company for centrifugal 
force load applications. It DOES NOT conform to ISO standards 
similarly published as s4 preferred shaft ﬁts.

(1)Does not apply to TNASW and TNASWE type bearings. 
(2)Example: If the minimum inner ring bore is 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) the suggested shaft size = 76.238 mm (3.0015 in.) to 76.225 mm (3.0010 in.) 
 for an inner ring ﬁt of 0.038 mm (0.0015 in.) tight to 0.012 mm (0.0005 in.) tight. 
(3)For inner ring bores between 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) and 101.600 mm (4.0000 in.) use a minimum ﬁt of 0.025 mm (0.001 in.) tight.

For heavy loads, high speed or shock, contact your Timken engi-
neer for further information. 
The Hydra-Rib outer ring is designed to be mounted either as a 
ﬂanged outer ring or shouldered against the outer ring backface. 
The 50.000 mm (1.968 in.) bore assembly does not have a ﬂanged 
outer ring and the outer ring backface must be mounted against 
the housing shoulder.

SHAFT AND HOUSING FITS
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Tolerances for housing bore and for shaft diameters are shown as variance from nominal bearing 
dimension. When application calls for thrust loads only, the housing must be relieved by 1⁄16 in. 
on diameter so that no radial load is carried on the bearing.

THRUST TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Tolerances for housing bore and shaft diameters are shown 
as variance from nominal bearing dimension. When one ring is 
piloted by the housing, sufﬁcient clearances must be allowed 
at the outside diameter of the other ring as well as at the bore 
of both rings to prevent cross-loading of the rollers. For  most 
applications, this clearance is approximately 1⁄16 in. (1.588 mm, 
0.0625 in.).

OPERATING TEMPERATURES
176  TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL   
OPERATING TEMPERATURES
Bearings operate in a wide range of applications and environments. 
In most cases, bearing operating temperature is not an issue. 
Some applications, however, operate at extreme speeds or in 
extreme temperature environments. In these cases, care must 
be taken not to exceed the temperature limits of the bearing. 
Minimum temperature limits are primarily based on lubricant 
capability. Maximum temperature limits are most often based on 
material and/or lubricant constraints, but also may be based on 
accuracy requirements of the equipment that the bearings are 
built into. These constraints/limitations are discussed below.
BEARING MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
Standard bearing steels with a standard heat treatment cannot 
maintain a minimum hardness of 58 HRC much above 120° C 
(250° F).  
Dimensional stability of Timken bearings is managed through the 
proper selection of an appropriate heat-treat process. Standard 
Timken tapered roller and ball bearings are dimensionally stabilized 
from -54° C (-65° F) up to 120° C (250° F), while standard spherical 
roller bearings are dimensionally stabilized up to 200° C (392° F) and 
standard cylindrical roller bearings are stabilized up to 150° C 
(302° F). Upon request, these bearings can be ordered to higher 
levels of stability as listed below. These designations are in 
agreement with DIN Standard 623.

With dimensionally stabilized product, there still may be some 
changes in dimensions during service as a result of microstructural 
transformations. These transformations include the continued 
tempering of martensite and decomposition of retained austenite. 
The magnitude of change depends on the operating temperature, 
the time at temperature and the composition and heat-treatment of 
the steel.
Temperatures exceeding the limits shown in Table 109 require 
special high-temperature steel. Consult your Timken engineer for 
availability of specific part numbers for non-standard heat 
stability or high-temperature steel grades.
Suggested materials for use in balls, rings and rollers at various 
operating temperatures are listed in table 110. Also listed 
are chemical composition recommendations, hardness 
recommendations and dimensional stability information.  
Operating temperature affects lubricant ﬁlm thickness and setting, 
both of which directly influence bearing life. Extremely high 
temperatures can result in a reduced ﬁlm thickness that can lead 
to asperity contact between contacting surfaces.
Operating temperature also can affect performance of cages, 
seals and shields, which in turn can affect bearing performance. 
Materials for these components and their operating temperature 
ranges are shown in table 111.
LUBRICATION LIMITATIONS
Starting torque in grease-lubricated applications typically increases 
signiﬁcantly at cold temperatures. Starting torque is not primarily 
a function of the consistency or channel properties of the grease. 
Most often, it is a function of the rheological properties of the 
grease.  
The high-temperature limit for greases is generally a function of the 
thermal and oxidation stability of the base oil in the grease and the 
effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors.   
See the LUBRICATION AND SEALS section on page 191 for more 
information on lubrication limitations.
EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The equipment designer must evaluate the effects of temperature 
on the performance of the equipment being designed. Precision 
machine tool spindles, for example, can be very sensitive to thermal 
expansions. For some spindles, it is important that the temperature 
rise over ambient be held to 20° C to 35° C (36° F to 45° F). 
Most industrial equipment can operate at considerably higher 
temperatures. Thermal ratings on gear drives, for example, are 
based on 93° C (200° F). Equipment such as gas turbines operates 
continuously at temperatures above 100° C (212° F). Running at high 
temperatures for extended periods of time, however, may affect 
shaft and housing ﬁts, if the shaft and housing are not machined 
and heat-treated properly .

OPERATING TEMPERATURES
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  177
Although bearings can operate satisfactorily up to 120° C (250° F), 
an upper temperature limit of 80° C to 95° C (176° F to 203° F) is more 
practical. Higher operating temperatures increase the risk of 
damage from transient temperature spikes. Prototype testing of the 
application can help deﬁne the operating temperature range and 
should be conducted if possible. It is the responsibility of the 
equipment designer to weigh all relevant factors and make the ﬁnal 
determination of satisfactory operating temperature.

HEAT GENERATION AND DISSIPATION
OPERATING TEMPERATURES
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  179
Bearing operating temperature is dependent upon a number 
of factors, including heat generation of all contributing heat 
sources, heat ﬂow rate between sources and the ability of the 
system to dissipate the heat. Heat sources include such things as 
bearings, seals, gears, clutches and oil supply. Heat dissipation is 
affected by many factors, including shaft and housing materials 
and designs, lubricant circulation and external environmental 
conditions. These and other factors are discussed in the following 
sections.  
HEAT GENERATION
Under normal operating conditions, most of the torque and heat 
generated by the bearing is caused by the elastohydrodynamic 
losses at the roller/ring contacts.
Heat generation is the product of bearing torque and speed. The 
following equation is used to calculate the heat generated.

Qgen  =  k4n M
If the bearing is tapered, the torque can be calculated using the 
following equation.

M 
= k1G1 (nμ)0.62 (Peq) 0.3
Where:
k1  
=  bearing torque constant

= 2.56 x 10-6 for M in N-m

= 3.54 x 10-5 for M in lbf-in.
k4 
=  0.105 for Qgen in W when M in N-m

=  6.73 x 10-4 for Qgen in Btu/min when M in lbf-in.
If the bearing is not a tapered bearing, the torque calculations 
are given in the subsequent sections. 
HEAT DISSIPATION
The problem of determining the heat ﬂow from a bearing in a 
speciﬁc application is rather complex. In general, it can be said 
that factors affecting the rate of heat dissipation include the 
following:
1.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the housing. This is 
affected by size conﬁguration of the house and any external 
cooling such as fans, water cooling or fan action of the rotating 
components.
2.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the shaft. Any other 
heat sources, such as gears and additional bearings and 
their proximity to the bearing considered, will inﬂuence the 
temperature of the shaft.
3.  The heat carried away by a circulating oil system. 
To what extent nos. 1 and 2 can be controlled will depend on 
the application. The heat-dissipation modes include conduction 
through the system, convection along the inside and outside 
surfaces of the system, as well as radiation exchange to and 
from neighboring structures. In many applications, overall heat 
dissipation can be divided into two categories – heat removed by 
circulating oil and heat removed through the structure. 
Heat dissipation by circulating oil
The amount of heat removed by the lubricant can be controlled 
more easily. In a splash lubrication system, cooling coils may be 
used to control the bulk oil temperature.
The amount of heat carried away in a circulating oil system by the 
lubricant can be approximated from the following equations.

Qoil =  k6 Cpf (
o - 
i)
Where:

  k6  =  1.67 x 10-5 for Qoil in W

=  1.67 x 10-2 for Qoil in Btu/min
If the circulating lubricant is petroleum oil, the heat removed is 
further approximated by the following:

Qoil  =  k5 f (
o - 
i) 
The following factors apply to the heat generation and dissipation 
equations listed on this page.
Where:

  k5 =  28 for Qoil in W when f in L/min and 
 in °C

=  0.42 for Qoil in Btu/min when f in U.S. pt/min 

 and 
 in °F

The rotational resistance of a rolling bearing depends on load, speed, 
lubrication conditions and internal bearing characteristics.
The following formulas yield approximations to values of bearing 
running torque. The formulas apply to bearings lubricated by oil. 
For bearings lubricated by grease or oil mist, torque is usually 
lower, although for grease lubrication this depends on amount 
and consistency of the grease. The formulas also assume the 
bearing running torque has stabilized after an initial period 
referred to as running-in.

RADIAL BALL BEARINGS, SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
SPEED RATINGS
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  185
SPEED RATINGS 
RADIAL BALL BEARINGS
There is no precise method for determining the maximum speed 
at which a ball bearing may operate. Bearing characteristics 
and features of surrounding parts, shafts, housing and other 
components as well as basic service conditions are all variables 
dependent upon each other for continued satisfactory high-speed 
performance. 
The safe operating speed of a bearing is often limited by the 
temperature within the bearing, which, in turn, is dependent 
upon the temperature surrounding the application, accuracy of 
bearings, shafts, housings, auxiliary parts, etc., and the type and 
amount of lubricant.
Radial bearings with proper internal reﬁnements will operate at 
high speeds for long periods if properly installed and lubricated. 
Tolerance grade, cage design, and lubricant are bearing 
characteristics which affect speed limitations. 
Bearings with ISO P0 tolerances are generally satisfactory for 
normal speeds with grease or oil lubrication.
Ball bearings with ISO P5 tolerances or better and ring-piloted 
composition cages lubricated with an efﬁcient, non-churning, 
cooling oil-mist system have exceptional high-speed ability.
In the case of duplex mountings, as frequently used in high-speed 
machine tool spindles, bearing preload and contact angle affect 
the permissible speeds.
The values in table 115 may be used as a general guide for 
determining the safe maximum speed of standard types of Timken 
ball bearings. To obtain the speed value for any bearing size with 
inner ring rotating, multiply the pitch diameter in millimeters (or, 
in the case of extra-small inch dimension bearings, the nearest 
millimeter equivalent) by the speed in revolutions per minute. 
Refer to table 116 on page 186 for the most suitable bearing type, 
cage style, tolerance guide and type of lubrication.
For outer ring rotation of ball bearings, multiply the speed value 
(pitch or mean dia. in. mm x RPM of the outer ring) by the following 
factors before referring to the table of speed values.
TABLE 115. BALL BEARING SERIES FACTOR
Extra-small (30 and S) and extra-light (9100 and M9300)
1.3
Light (200, 5200 and 7200)
1.5
Medium (300, 5300 and 7300)
1.7
Although the speed values shown in the tables on the following 
page are based on many years of research and accumulated 
data, numerous applications of Timken bearings are suc-
cessfully operating with speed values far in excess of those 
tabulated. Such applications require particular consideration 
of proper tolerance grade, lubrication, the effect of centrifugal 
force on rolling elements and other factors. For further infor-
mation consult your Timken engineer.
Conversely, under certain application conditions of load, 
temperature, contamination, etc., speed ratings may be less 
than the ﬁgures shown. These values do not apply to certain 
special bearings, such as radial Tri-Ply series, square or hex 
bore bearings.
The speed capability of a bearing in any application is subject to 
a number of factors including:
 t Temperature.
 t Bearing setting or clearance.
 t Lubrication.
 t Bearing design.
The relative importance of each of these factors depends on 
the nature of the application. The effect of each factor is not 
isolated – each contributes in varying degrees, depending on the 
application and overall speed capability of the design.
An understanding of how each of these factors affects 
performance as speeds change is required to achieve the speed 
capabilities inherent in a bearing.
SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL ROLLER 
BEARINGS
For Timken cylindrical roller and spherical roller bearings, the 
thermal speed ratings are listed in the bearing tables. These 
values have been determined by balancing the heat generated 
within the bearing with the heat dissipated from the bearing. 
In calculating these numbers, the following assumptions have 
been made:
 t The radial load is ﬁve percent of the static load rating.
 t For oil, it is assumed to be in a bath with the ﬁll to the   
middle of the lowest rolling element. For grease it is   
assumed a 30 percent bearing cavity ﬁll.

 t The oil viscosity is assumed to be 12 cSt (ISO VG32)  
operated at 70˚ C (158˚ F) and the grease base oil viscosity  
is assumed to be 22 cSt operated at 70˚ C (158˚ F). The  
bearing and its components are at 70˚ C and the bearing 
environment is at 20˚ C (68˚ F).

(1) For oil bath lubrication, oil level should be maintained covering between 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 up from the bottom of the lowest ball.
Note: Single or double normal contact (P or PP) sealed bearings should not exceed 300000 PDN.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
SPEED RATINGS
 TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  187
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS 
The usual measure of the speed of a tapered roller bearing is the 
circumferential velocity at the midpoint of the inner ring large end 
rib, ﬁg, 144. This may be calculated as:
Rib speed:
 =    
 Dmn
            60000        
(m/s)
 =    
 Dmn
               12            
(ft/min)
Where:
Dm  
=  Mean inner ring large rib diameter       mm, in.
n  
=  Bearing speed  
                     rev/min
The mean large rib diameter at the midpoint of the roller end 
contact can be scaled from a drawing of the bearing, if available, 
or this diameter can be determined by consulting your Timken 
engineer. The inner, inner ring mean large rib diameter can be 
approximated by taking 99 percent of larger rib O.D.
DN values (the product of the inner ring bore in mm and the speed 
in rev/min) are often used as a measure of bearing speed by other 
bearing manufacturers. There is no direct relationship between 
the rib speed of a tapered roller bearing and DN value because of 
the wide variation in bearing cross sectional thickness. However, 
for rough approximation, one meter per second rib speed is about 
equal to 16000 DN for average section bearings. One foot per 
minute is equal to approximately 80 DN.
Table 117 is a summary of guidelines relating to speed and 
temperature based on customer experience, customer tests 
and research conducted by The Timken Company. Consult 
your Timken engineer with questions regarding high- 
speed capability.

LUBRICATION
To help maintain a bearing’s antifriction 
characteristics, lubrication is needed to:
 t Minimize rolling resistance due to 
deformation of the rolling elements 
and raceway under load by separating 
the mating surfaces.
 t Minimize sliding friction occurring  
between rolling elements, raceways and cage.
 t Transfer heat (with oil lubrication).
 t Protect from corrosion and, with grease lubrication,  
from contaminant ingress.

LUBRICATION
The wide range of bearing types and operating conditions 
precludes any simple, all-inclusive statement or guideline 
allowing the selection of the proper lubricant. At the design 
level, the ﬁrst consideration is whether oil or grease is best for 
the particular operation. The advantages of oil and grease are 
outlined in the table below. When heat must be carried away from 
the bearing, oil must be used. It is almost always preferred for 
very high-speed applications. For speed ratings of grease and 
oil-lubricated bearings, see pages 185-187.
TABLE 125. ADVANTAGES OF OIL AND GREASE
Oil

from the bearings

frequent lubrication
European REACH compliance
Timken-branded lubricants, greases and similar products sold 
in stand-alone containers or delivery systems are subject to the 
European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and 
Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the European 
Union, Timken can sell and provide only those lubricants and 
greases that are registered with ECHA (European CHemical Agency). 
For further information, please contact your Timken engineer.
OIL LUBRICATION
Oils used for bearing lubrication should be high-quality mineral 
oils or synthetic oils with similar properties. Selection of the 
proper type of oils depends on bearing speed, load, operating 
temperature and lubrication method. Some features and 
advantages of oil lubrication, in addition to the above are:
 t Oil is a better lubricant for high speeds or high tempera-
tures. It can be cooled to help reduce bearing temperature.
 t It is easier to handle and control the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearing. It is harder to retain in the bearing. 
Lubricant losses may be higher than with grease.
 t Oil can be introduced to the bearing in many ways, such as 
drip-feed, wick-feed, pressurized circulating systems, oil bath 
or air-oil mist. Each is suited for certain types of applications.
 t Oil is easier to keep clean for recirculating systems.
Oil may be introduced to the bearing housing in many ways. The 
most common systems are:
 t Oil bath. The housing is designed to provide a sump 
through which the rolling elements of the bearing will pass. 
Generally, the oil level should be no higher than the center 
point of the lowest rolling element. If speed is high, lower  
oil levels should be used to reduce churning. Gages or  
controlled elevation drains are used to achieve and  
maintain the proper oil level.
 t Circulating system. This system has the advantages of:
t An adequate supply of oil for both cooling and 
lubrication.
t Metered control of the quantity of oil delivered to  
each bearing.
t Removal of contaminants and moisture from the 
bearing by ﬂushing action.
t Suitability for multiple bearing installations.
t Large reservoir, which reduces deterioration. 
Increased lubricant life provides economical 
efﬁciency.
t Incorporation of oil-ﬁltering devices.
t Positive control to deliver the lubricant where needed.
t A typical circulating oil system consists of an oil 
reservoir, pump, piping and ﬁlter. A heat exchange  
may be required.
 t Oil-mist lubrication. Oil-mist lubrication systems are used in 
high-speed, continuous-operation applications. This system 
permits close control of the amount of lubricant reaching the 
bearings. The oil may be metered, atomized by compressed 
air and mixed with air, or it may be picked up from a reser-
voir using a venturi effect. In either case, the air is ﬁltered 
and supplied under sufﬁcient pressure to assure adequate 
lubrication of the bearings. Control of this type  
of lubrication system is accomplished by monitoring the  
operating temperatures of the bearings being lubricated. The 
continuous passage of the pressurized air and oil through 
the labyrinth seals used in the system prevents the entrance 
of contaminants from the atmosphere to the system.
The successful operation of this type of system is based 
upon the following factors: 
t Proper location of the lubricant entry ports in relation 
to the bearings being lubricated.
t Avoidance of excessive pressure drops across void 
spaces within the system.
t Proper air pressure and oil quantity ratio to suit the  
particular application.

LUBRICATION
LUBRICATION AND SEALS
TIMKEN ENGINEERING MANUAL  193
Lubricating oils are commercially available in many forms for 
automotive, industrial, aircraft and other uses. Oils are classiﬁed 
as either petroleum types (reﬁned from crude oil) or synthetic 
types (produced by chemical synthesis).
PETROLEUM OILS 
Petroleum oils are made from a petroleum hydrocarbon derived 
from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. 
Petroleum oils are used for nearly all oil-lubricated applications 
of bearings. 
SYNTHETIC OILS
Synthetic oils cover a broad range of categories and include 
polyalphaoleﬁns, silicones, polyglycols and various esters. In 
general, synthetic oils are less prone to oxidation and can operate 
at extreme hot or cold temperatures. Physical properties, such as 
pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients, tend to vary between oil types; 
use caution when making oil selections.
The polyalphaoleﬁns (PAO) have a hydrocarbon chemistry that 
parallels petroleum oil both in chemical structures and pressure-
viscosity coefﬁcients. Therefore, PAO oil is mostly used in the 
oil-lubricated applications of bearings when severe temperature 
environments (hot and cold) are encountered or when extended 
lubricant life is required. 
The silicone, ester and polyglycol oils have an oxygen-based 
chemistry that is structurally quite different from petroleum 
oils and PAO oils. This difference has a profound effect on its 
physical properties where pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients can 
be lower compared to mineral and PAO oils. This means that 
these types of synthetic oils may actually generate a smaller 
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁlm thickness than a mineral or PAO 
oil of equal viscosity at operating temperature. Reductions in 
bearing fatigue life and increases in bearing wear could result 
from this reduction of lubricant ﬁlm thickness.
VISCOSITY
The selection of oil viscosity for any bearing application requires 
consideration of several factors: load, speed, bearing setting, 
type of oil and environmental factors. Since oil viscosity varies 
inversely with temperature, a viscosity value must always be 
stated with the temperature at which it was determined. High- 
viscosity oil is used for low-speed or high-ambient-temperature 
applications. Low-viscosity oil is used for high-speed or low-
ambient-temperature applications.
There are several classiﬁcations of oils based on viscosity grades. 
The most familiar are the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
classiﬁcations for automotive engine and gear oils. The American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) have adopted standard 
viscosity grades for industrial ﬂuids. Fig. 145 shows the viscosity 
comparisons of ISO/ASTM with SAE classiﬁcation systems at 
40° C (104° F).

t Adequate exhaust of the air-oil mist after lubrication 
has been accomplished. 
To ensure “wetting” of the bearings, and to prevent 
possible damage to the rolling elements and rings, it is 
imperative that the oil-mist system be turned on for several 
minutes before the equipment is started. The importance of 
“wetting” the bearing before starting cannot be overstated, 
and it also has particular signiﬁcance for equipment that 
has been idled for extended periods of time.

Industrial EP gear oils should be composed of a highly reﬁned 
petroleum oil-based stock plus appropriate inhibitors and 
additives. They should not contain materials that are corrosive 
or abrasive to bearings. The inhibitors should provide long-term 
protection from oxidation and protect the bearing from corrosion 
in the presence of moisture. The oils should resist foaming in 
service and have good water-separation properties. An EP 
additive protects against scoring under boundary-lubrication 
conditions. The viscosity grades suggested represent a wide 
range. High-temperature and/or slow-speed applications 
generally require the higher viscosity grades. Low temperatures 
and/or high speeds require the use of lower viscosity grades.

GREASE LUBRICATION
Grease lubrication is generally applicable to low-to-moderate 
speed applications that have operating temperatures within 
the limits of the grease. There is no universal anti-friction 
bearing grease. Each grease has limiting properties and 
characteristics.
Greases consist of a base oil, a thickening agent and additives. 
Conventionally, bearing greases have consisted of petroleum 
base oils thickened to the desired consistency by some form of 
metallic soap. More recently synthetic base oils have been used 
with organic and inorganic thickeners. Table 128 summarizes the

ingress is an issue. Lithium-based greases are multi-purpose and 
are used in industrial applications and wheel bearings. 
Synthetic base oils such as esters, organic esters and silicones 
used with conventional thickeners and additives typically have 
higher maximum operating temperatures than petroleum-based 
greases. Synthetic greases can be designed to operate in 
temperatures from -73° C (-100° F) to 288° C (550° F).
Below are the general characteristics of common thickeners 
used with petroleum base oils.

Use of the thickeners in table 129 with synthetic hydrocarbon or 
ester base oils increases the maximum operating temperature 
by approximately 10° C (50° F).
Using polyurea as a thickener for lubricating ﬂuids is one of the 
most signiﬁcant lubrication developments in more than 30 years. 
Polyurea grease performance is outstanding in a wide range of 
bearing applications and, in a relatively short time, it has gained 
acceptance as a factory-packed lubricant for ball bearings.
LOW TEMPERATURES
Starting torque in a grease-lubricated bearing at low temperatures 
can be critical. Some greases may function adequately as long 
as the bearing is operating, but resistance to initial movement 
may be excessive. In certain smaller machines, starting may be 
impossible when very cold. Under such operating circumstances, 
greases containing low-temperature characteristic oils are 
generally required.
If the operating temperature range is wide, synthetic greases 
offer advantages. Synthetic greases are available to provide very 
low starting and running torque at temperatures as low as -73° 
C (-100° F). In certain instances, these greases perform better in 
this respect than oil.
An important point concerning lubricating greases is that the 
starting torque is not necessarily a function of the consistency 
or the channel properties of the grease. Starting torque is more 
a function of the individual rheological properties of a particular 
grease and is best evaluated by application experience.
HIGH TEMPERATURES
The high temperature limit for lubricating greases is generally 
a function of the thermal and oxidation stability of the ﬂuid and 
the effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors. Grease temperature 
ranges are deﬁned by both the dropping point of the grease 
thickener and composition of the base oil. Table 130 shows 
the temperature ranges of various base oils used in grease 
formulations. 
A rule of thumb, developed from years of testing grease-
lubricated bearings, indicates that grease life is halved for every 
10° C (50° F) increase in temperature. For example, if a particular 
grease provides 2000 hours of life at 90° C (194° F), by raising the 
temperature to 100° C (212° F), reduction in life to approximately 
1000 hours would result. On the other hand, 4000 hours could be 
expected by lowering the temperature to 80° C (176° F).

Thermal stability, oxidation resistance and temperature limitations 
must be considered when selecting greases for high-temperature 
applications. In non-relubricatable applications, highly reﬁned 
mineral oils or chemically stable synthetic ﬂuids are required 
as the oil component of greases for operation at temperatures 
above 121° C (250° F).
CONTAMINATION
Abrasive Particles
When roller bearings operate in a clean environment, the primary 
cause of damage is the eventual fatigue of the surfaces where 
rolling contact occurs. However, when particle contamination 
enters the bearing system, it is likely to cause damage such as 
bruising, which can shorten bearing life.
When dirt from the environment or metallic wear debris from 
some component in the application are allowed to contaminate 
the lubricant, wear can become the predominant cause of 
bearing damage. If bearing wear becomes signiﬁcant, changes 
will occur to critical bearing dimensions that could adversely 
affect machine operation.
Bearings operating in a contaminated lubricant exhibit a higher 
initial rate of wear than those running in an uncontaminated 
lubricant. With no further contaminant ingress, this wear rate 
quickly diminishes. The contamination particles are reduced 
in size as they pass through the bearing contact area during 
normal operation.
Water
Water and moisture can be particularly conducive to bearing 
damage. Lubricating greases may provide a measure of protection 
from this contamination. Certain greases, such as calcium and 
aluminum-complex, are highly water-resistant.
Sodium-soap greases are water-soluble and should not be used 
in applications involving water.
Either dissolved or suspended water in lubricating oils can exert 
a detrimental inﬂuence on bearing fatigue life. Water can cause 
bearing etching that also can reduce bearing fatigue life. The 
exact mechanism by which water lowers fatigue life is not fully 
understood. It has been suggested that water enters micro-cracks 
in the bearing rings that are caused by repeated stress cycles. 
This leads to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement in the micro-
cracks, reducing the time required for these cracks to propagate 
to an unacceptable-sized spall.
Water-based ﬂuids, such as water glycol and invert emulsions, 
also have shown a reduction in bearing fatigue life. Although 
water from these sources is not the same as contamination, 
the results support the previous discussion concerning water-
contaminated lubricants.
GREASE SELECTION
The successful use of bearing grease depends on the physical 
and chemical properties of the lubricant as well as application 
and environmental conditions. Because the choice of grease 
for a particular bearing under certain service conditions is often 
difﬁcult to make, you should consult with your lubricant supplier 
or equipment maker for speciﬁc questions about lubrication 
requirements for your application. You also can contact your 
Timken engineer for general lubrication guidelines for any 
application.
Grease must be carefully selected with regard to its consistency 
at operating temperature. It should not exhibit thickening, 
separation of oil, acid formation or hardening to any marked 
degree. It should be smooth, non-ﬁbrous and entirely free from 
chemically active ingredients. Its dropping point should be 
considerably higher than the operating temperature.

GREASE USE GUIDELINES
It is important to use the proper amount of grease in the 
application. In typical industrial applications, the bearing cavity 
should be kept approximately one-third to one-half full. Less 
grease may result in the bearing being starved for lubrication. 
More grease may result in churning. Both conditions may result in 
excessive temperature. As the grease temperature rises, viscosity 
decreases and the grease becomes thinner. This can reduce the 
lubricating effect and increase leakage of the grease from the 
bearing. It also may cause the grease components to separate, 
leading to a general breakdown of the lubricant properties. As 
the grease breaks down, bearing torque increases. In the case 
of excess grease resulting in churning, torque may also increase 
due to the resistance caused by the grease.  
For best results, there should be ample space in the housing to 
allow room for excess grease to be thrown from the bearing. 
However, it is equally important that the grease be retained all 
around the bearing. If a large void exists between the bearings, 
grease closures should be used to prevent the grease from 
leaving the bearing area.
Only in low-speed applications may the housing be entirely ﬁlled 
with grease. This method of lubrication is a safeguard against the 
entry of foreign matter, where sealing provisions are inadequate 
for exclusion of contaminants or moisture.
During periods of non-operation, it is often wise to completely ﬁll 
the housings with grease to protect the bearing surfaces. Prior 
to restarting operation, remove the excess grease and restore 
the proper level.
Applications utilizing grease lubrication should have a grease 
ﬁtting and a vent at opposite ends of the housing near the top. A 
drain plug should be located near the bottom of the housing to 
allow the old grease to purge from the bearing.
Bearings should be relubricated at regular intervals to prevent 
damage. Relubrication intervals are difﬁcult to determine. If plant 
practice or experience with other applications is not available, 
consult your lubricant supplier.
Timken offers a range of lubricants to help bearings and 
related components operate effectively in demanding industrial 
operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant 
additives offer greater protection in challenging environments. 
Timken also offers a line of single- and multi-point lubricators to 
simplify grease delivery.
Grease application methods
Grease, in general, is easier to use than oil in industrial bearing 
lubrication applications. Most bearings that are initially packed 
with grease require periodic relubrication to operate efﬁciently.
Grease should be packed into the bearing so that it gets between 
the rolling elements – the rollers or balls. For tapered roller 
bearings, forcing grease through the bearing from the large end 
to the small end will ensure proper distribution.
Grease can be easily packed into small- and medium-size 
bearings by hand (fig. 147). In shops where bearings are 
frequently regreased, a mechanical grease packer that forces 
grease through the bearing under pressure may be appropriate 
(ﬁg. 148). Regardless of the method, after packing the internal 
areas of the bearing, a small amount of grease also should be 
smeared on the outside of the rollers or balls.
The two primary considerations that determine the relubrication 
cycle are operating temperature and sealing efﬁciency. High- 
operating-temperature applications generally require more 
frequent regreasing. The less efﬁcient the seals, the greater the 
grease loss and the more frequently grease must be added. 
Grease should be added any time the amount in the bearing 
falls below the desired amount. The grease should be replaced 
when its lubrication properties have been reduced through 
contamination, high temperature, water, oxidation or any other 
factors. For additional information on appropriate regreasing 
cycles, consult with the equipment manufacturer or your Timken 
engineer.

Prelubricated bearings
Prelubricated shielded and sealed bearings are successfully 
used in applications where:
 t Grease might be injurious to other parts of the 
mechanism.
 t Cost and space limitations preclude the use of a grease- 
ﬁlled housing.
 t Housings cannot be kept free of dirt and grit, water or other 
contaminants.
 t Relubrication is impossible or would be a hazard  
to satisfactory use.
Prelubricated bearings are pre-packed with greases that have 
chemical and mechanical stability, and they have demonstrated 
long-life characteristics in rotating bearings. Greases are 
ﬁltered several times to remove all harmful material, and they 
are accurately metered so that each bearing receives the proper 
amount of grease.
For ball bearings, polyurea and lithium-based greases are 
normally preferred for general-purpose bearing lubrication and 
are advantageous in high-moisture applications. Both greases 
have good water-resistant characteristics. For temperature 
ranges of standard greases, see table 132.

CONSISTENCY
Greases may vary in consistency from semi-ﬂuids that are hardly 
thicker than a viscous oil to solid grades almost as hard as a 
soft wood.
Consistency is measured by a penetrometer in which a standard 
weighted cone is dropped into the grease. The distance the cone 
penetrates (measured in tenths of a millimeter in a speciﬁc time) 
is the penetration number.
The National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) classiﬁcation 
of grease consistency is shown below:

Grease consistency is not ﬁxed; it normally becomes softer 
when sheared or “worked.” In the laboratory, this “working” is 
accomplished by forcing a perforated plate up and down through 
a closed container of grease. This “working” does not compare 
with the violent shearing action that takes place in a bearing and 
does not necessarily correlate with actual performance.

SEALS
The stamping shown in ﬁg. 149 is effective for applications that 
are grease lubricated and operate in clean conditions. The 
design illustrated in ﬁg. 150 uses stampings on both sides of the 
bearing to keep the grease in close proximity to the bearing. The 
ﬂinger mounted at the outer side of the bearing adds a labyrinth 
effect. 
Stampings should be designed to provide a clearance of 0.5 to 
0.6 mm (0.020 to 0.025 in.) on diameters between rotating and 
stationary parts. A minimum axial clearance of 3 mm (0.125 in.) 
should be provided.
MACHINED FLINGERS
Machined parts, along with other closure elements, can be used 
in place of stampings when closer clearances are desired. This 
results in a more efﬁcient retention of lubricant and exclusion of 
foreign matter from the bearing housing. Examples are shown in 
ﬁg. 151 and ﬁg. 152.
An umbrella-shaped ﬂinger is shown in ﬁg. 152 combined with 
an annular groove closure. This combination effectively retains 
oil and keeps out dirt at high shaft speeds.
SEALS 
SELECTING THE RIGHT SEAL
When selecting the proper seal design for any Timken bearing 
application, it is necessary to consider the type of lubricant, the 
operation environment, the speed of the application and general 
operating conditions.
SHAFT FINISH
It is important to ensure that no spiral grooves result from 
machining the shaft surfaces since these will tend to draw 
lubricant out of, or contaminant into, the bearing cavity. Plunge 
grinding normally produces a satisfactory surface ﬁnish.
GREASE LUBRICATION – VENTING 
Venting should be provided in the cavity between the two 
bearings when grease lubrication is used in conjunction with 
contacting or non-contacting seals. This will prevent an ingress of 
contamination past the seals in the event of a pressure differential 
between the bearing cavity and atmosphere.
VERTICAL SHAFT CLOSURES –  
OIL LUBRICATION
Lubricating vertical shaft bearings is a difﬁcult task. Normally, 
grease, oil-mist or oil-air lubrication is used because of the 
simplicity. However, some high-speed and/or heavy load 
applications will use circulating oil. This requires a very good 
sealing system and a suction pump to remove the oil from the 
bottom bearing position.
NON-CONTACTING SEALS
METAL STAMPINGS
Metal stamping closures are effective in clean applications. 
When environmental conditions are dirty, stampings are used in 
combination with other closure elements to provide an effective 
labyrinth against the entry of foreign matter into the bearing 
chamber.

ANNULAR GROOVES
Annular groove closures are often used with grease lubrication 
in place of radial lip seals when considerable grit and dust are 
encountered. The closure usually has several grooves machined 
in the bore or on the outside diameter depending on the design. 
They become ﬁlled with grease, which tends to harden and 
provide a tight closure. When used with oil, the grooves tend 
to interrupt the capillary action which would otherwise draw 
oil out of the bearing cavity. Annular grooves with a machined 
labyrinth effectively protect a grease-lubricated bearing when 
the unit is required to operate in an extremely dirty environment 
(ﬁg. 153). This type of closure is most effective when applied with 
close-running clearances and the maximum possible number of 
grooves. Suggested dimensions are shown in table 135.
Fig. 153. Annular grooves combined with machined labyrinth.
CONTACTING SEALS
RADIAL LIP SEALS
Many types and styles of radial lip seals are commercially available 
to satisfy different sealing requirements. In clean environments, 
where the primary requirement is the retention of lubricant in the 
bearing housing, a single lip seal with the lip pointing inward is 
often used. When the critical concern is excluding contaminants, 
the lip is usually pointed outward (ﬁg. 154).
Fig. 154. Radial lip seals.
Lip seals are available with or without a spring-loaded lip. The 
spring maintains a constant pressure of the lip on the sealing 
surface, thereby providing a more efﬁcient seal for a longer 
period of time. When environmental conditions require a seal to 
prevent contaminants from entering the bearing chamber as well 
as retaining the lubricant, a double or triple lip seal is often used. 
Additional ﬂingers or shrouds should be used as primary seals 
when extremely dirty conditions are present. The seal lip and 
sealing surface are protected to avoid rapid wear and premature 
seal damage (ﬁg. 155).
Seal wear surfaces are normally required to have a surface 
ﬁnish in the order of 0.25-0.40 μm (10-15 μin.) Ra. In general, for 
applications exposed to severe contamination, the seal wear 
surface should have a minimum surface hardness of HRC 45. The 
seal supplier should be consulted for more speciﬁc guidance.

V-RING SEALS
V-ring seals can be used in conjunction with grease or oil 
lubrication. As rotational speeds increase, the lip tends to pull 
away from the sealing surface and acts like a ﬂinger. This seal 
may be used with either oil or grease lubrication (ﬁg. 160). Consult 
your V-ring seal supplier for application restrictions.

DUO FACE®-PLUS SEALS
The DUO FACE-PLUS seal (ﬁg. 156) has double lips that seal in the

SHIELDS (D-TYPE)
Both K and W single-row radial types are available with one

on one side provides protection against the entrance of coarse 
dirt or chips and makes it possible to relubricate the bearing from 
the open side as shown (ﬁg. 161).
Double-shielded bearings are prelubricated with the correct 
amount of Timken-suggested ball bearing grease and are 
designed for applications where relubrication is not required 
(ﬁg. 162). 
LABYRINTH OR MECHANI-SEALS (L-TYPE)
Bearings with Mechani-Seals are made in the non-ﬁlling slot type 
only and are available with a single seal, designated by sufﬁx L; 
one seal and one shield; sufﬁx LD, and two seals, sufﬁx LL. These 
bearings have standard bores, outside diameters and outer ring 
widths, but the inner ring is wider than standard unshielded and 
shielded sizes. As illustrated, in the L- and LD-types (ﬁgs. 163 and 
164), the inner rings are offset slightly on the side opposite the 
seal in order to permit clearance when the bearings are mounted 
in blind housings.
Timken developed the Mechani-Seal to provide an ultra-low 
friction seal that also provides effective grease retention and 
contaminant exclusion. It consists of two dished steel members. 
The inner member is ﬁxed to the outer ring which is typically 
stationary and provides a barrier which retains the grease.  The 
outer member is pressed on the outside diameter of the inner 
ring and rotates as a ﬂinger to throw off contaminants. Close 
running clearances between the inner and outer members ensure 
effective sealing under extremely severe conditions. This seal 
conﬁguration is very effective under high speeds, because the 
non-contacting nature of the seal results in minimal friction and 
higher speed of the ﬂinger deﬂects more contaminants. Mechani-
Seal bearings are very popular in high-speed pneumatic tools, 
small electric motors, pumps, domestic appliances and similar 
high-speed applications. A typical mounting arrangement for the 
LL-type is shown (ﬁg. 165).
Wide-type radial bearings (W-LL-type) with Mechani-Seals are 
designated by the preﬁx W and sufﬁx LL for two seals. They are 
made in standard bores and outside diameters, but in widths the 
same as those of corresponding size double-row bearings. The 
extra width affords greater space for long-life factory-ﬁltered 
grease and provides extra support on shafts and in housings so 
that locknuts and lockwashers are not needed on applications 
such as electric motors. A typical mounting is shown (ﬁg. 167).

FELT SEALS (T-TYPE)
The felt seal consists of two metal plates ﬁxed in the outer ring 
of the bearing that enclose a felt ring. This felt ring, which is 
saturated with oil before assembly in the bearing, contacts the 
ground outside diameter of the inner ring to provide sealing with 
minimum friction drag. 
Bearings with felt seals are made only in the non-ﬁlling slot type 
and are available with one seal (designated by the sufﬁx T), one 
seal and one shield (identiﬁed by sufﬁx TD), and two seals (sufﬁx 
TT). Bores and outside diameters of these bearings are the same 
as standard unshielded and shielded types, but overall widths 
are greater. As illustrated, in the T- and TD-types (ﬁgs. 168 and 
169), the inner rings are offset slightly on the opposite side of 
the seal to permit clearance when the bearings are mounted in 
blind housings.
RUBBER SEALS (P-TYPE)
Radial bearings with rubber seals having one or two seals 
are designated by the sufﬁxes P and PP, respectively. With 
the exception of the extra-small sizes, they are dimensionally 
interchangeable with open-type and shielded bearings.
The P-type design is a positive contact seal using a molded 
synthetic rubber. Firmly ﬁxed to the outer ring, the seal ﬂares 
outward and rides on the inner ring. The ﬂare-out of the seal 
against the inner ring radius ensures constant positive contact 
to provide an effective barrier against contaminant entry or 
lubricant loss.
Timken rubber seal bearings provide a convenient compact 
design because they interchange dimensionally with standard 
single-row radial types.
Wide-type radial rubber seal bearings (W-PP type) designated 
by preﬁx W and sufﬁx PP for two seals are made with standard 
bores and outside diameters, but with widths the same as those 
as corresponding double-row bearings. This design also utilizes 
a molded seal.
The extra width offers a larger contact area for the shaft 
and housing and also provides additional space for grease 
displacement under agitation.
These wide-type rubber seal bearings are particularly well-suited 
for use by electric motor manufacturers; advantages of the 
bearing have helped simplify design. A typical example of motor 
design simpliﬁcation is illustrated (ﬁg. 171).

RUBBER SEALS (R-TYPE)
One of the most advanced sealing designs introduced by Timken 
is the R-type rubber seal bearing. This is a positive-contact seal of 
three-piece construction, utilizing a synthetic rubber seal retained 
by two steel caps. The seal ﬂares outward and rides or wipes on 
the ground land of the inner ring. In this design, the rubber sealing 
element is completely protected by a closely ﬁtting outer cap or 
shroud, which nests tightly against the seal member following 
its ﬂared-out shape at the inner ring of the outside diameter. 
The innermost member is crimped into a groove in the outer 
ring and encapsulates the seal and outside shroud. Providing 
ﬁrm seal contact, the back-up plate of the seal assembly has a 
close clearance with the outside diameter of the inner ring. This 
prevents the seal from being pushed inward.
The R-type seal provides improved lubricant retention, greater 
protection against contaminant ingress and protection against 
abrasive damage of the rubber seal, which is encountered in 
agricultural and textile applications.  This seal construction also 
is available in standard and heavy series wide inner bearings.   
TRI-PLY SEALS
Tri-Ply Shroud Seal ball bearings are designed for bearing 
applications involving exceptionally severe contamination or 
abrasion environments. They are produced in many types and 
sizes, both in the radial and wide inner ring designs.
Each Tri-Ply seal consists of a triple-lip nitrile seal molded to a 
heavy metal shroud cap. All three seal lips have heavy ﬂare-
out contact with the inner ring outside diameter and provide 
exceptionally effective protection against lubricant loss and wet 
or abrasive contaminants entry. The shroud cap, which nests 
closely with the outside seal lip, helps protect the rubber seal 
members from abrasive damage.  
A feature of these bearings is the balanced design, consisting 
of deep raceways, large ball size, and extra-wide or heavy inner 
rings. The use of Tri-Ply bearings simpliﬁes housing designs, 
and their extra inner ring width provides greater support on the 
shaft. These bearings are widely used on conveyors and farm 
machinery such as disc harrows, hillers, tomato harvesters and 
cotton harvesters.
