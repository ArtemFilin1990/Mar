optibelt OMEGA and optibelt ZR timing belts have been 
developed for the use in high performance drives. Drive 
speed is transmitted synchronously, i.e. without speed 
loss, and with a constant transmission ratio. 
The optibelt OMEGA tooth profile significantly reduces 
the running noise level. The teeth are designed to ensure 
that they mesh perfectly, with minimal friction, into the 
pulley teeth. optibelt OMEGA timing belts run in HTD 
and RPP pulleys.  
This technical manual contains all important information 
for the belts usage. Furthermore, the calculation methods 
for the drive design with optibelt OMEGA, optibelt 
­OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER, optibelt 
OMEGA HL and ZR timing belts are also presented.
The belt characteristics described may change due to 
various influences. Thus, the drives must be designed 
based on their intended use (or in a way that comes close 
to their intended use).
If you have any further questions, please make use of 
the free service offered by our Application Engineering 
Department.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
TIMINg bELTs IN optibelt OMEgA PROFILE
optibelt OMEgA
the optibelt OmEGA timing belt has the performance level of the established 
optibelt HtD timing belt and is its replacement. the belt is best for medium 
performance drives in all speed ranges without heavy shock loading.
Double-sided timing belts for drives with reversible speed can be delivered 
with HTD profi les.
Double-sided timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profi les on request.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA page 54-58.
optibelt OMEGA Profi le
The optibelt OMEGA profi le is a further development of the optibelt HTD profi le. Its advantage, compared to the other 
timing belt profi les, is reduced running noise.
optibelt ZRs
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER and optibelt OMEGA HL timing belts are used in 
optibelt zrS HtD timing belt pulleys or in rPP timing belt pulleys. 
For applications in other pulleys, please contact the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
optibelt OMEgA HL
On high and low speed drives the optibelt OmEGA HL timing belt exceeds 
the performance of the optibelt OmEGA HP by up to 15 %. It was also 
specially designed for shock loaded drives.
In new drives for these applications, the OmEGA HL achieves supreme 
operational reliability combined with optimum economic effi ciency.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA HL pages 46-47.
optibelt OMEgA FAN POwER
The optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER timing belt was developed for fan drives 
in the oil industry.
The optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER is characterised by a long service life and 
antistatic properties.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER pages 48-49.
optibelt OMEgA HP
the optibelt OmEGA HP timing belt reaches a performance level up to 
150 % higher than that of optibelt OmEGA and is especially applicable for 
cost-effi cient new designs.
the optibelt OmEGA HP is suitable for both low speed and high speed 
drives with high power and steady loads.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA HP pages 50-53.

All optibelt optibelt OMEGA timing belts have inherent 
resistance to oil, heat, cold, ozone and tropical conditions. 
Special labelling is not required.
Oil resistance
The limited oil resistance prevents the damaging effects of 
mineral oils and greases, as long as these substances are 
not in permanent contact with the timing belt and/or are not 
present in large quantities. With increased demands for 
resistance, e.g. to mineral oils, the performance of the 
optibelt OMEGA timing belts can be improved by using 
special belt constructions. Please contact the optibelt 
Application Engineering Department.
Temperature resistance
The timing belt can withstand ambient temperatures 
from ≈ –30 °C to +100 °C. Temperatures outside this range 
lead to premature ageing and embrittlement of the timing 
belts and thus to their premature failure. The temperature 
resistance of optibelt OMEGA timing belts can be extended 
using special belt constructions, e.g. up to +140 °C. Please 
contact the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
Antistatic properties
Antistatic properties enable the safe discharge of electro-
static charges. This charging can have such a strong impact 
on timing belts with insufficient electrical conductivity that 
there is the danger of ignition due to sparks. The use of 
antistatic timing belts requires that the properties be checked 
in accordance with ISO 9563, and is confirmed by the issue 
of an inspection certificate. optibelt OMEGA HP and 
optibelt OMEGA HL timing belts in profiles 8M and 14M as 
well as optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER are antistatic 
according to ISO 9563 by standard and are thus labelled 
accordingly.
Noise emission
The optimized tooth shape and the indent in the tooth tip of 
the optibelt OMEGA promote a significantly lower noise 
level. In combination with the newly developed materials, 
the noise level is further reduced, even at high speeds and 
with high belt tensions. 
Operational life
Belt designs with increased capacity can exceed the 
potential operational life of standard designs many times 
over, particularly for highly loaded or overloaded drives. 
Example: Dynamic tests with optibelt OMEGA HP show that 
the running times, compared to standard timing belts, are 
up to 18 times higher.
Efficiency
The specially developed tooth fabric and the flexible belt 
design make possible a virtually frictionless drive with an 
efficiency of up to 98 %.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
optibelt OMEgA HL TIMINg bELTs
structure
top layer
tension cord
tooth
Fabric
Top layer
the top layer of the optibelt OmEGA HL as well as the the 
teeth, consists of a polychloroprene compound reinforced 
with aramid fi bres. Thus, an even more abrasion resistant 
surface is in contact with any reverse bend idler. the belt 
top layer protects the tension cord from environmental 
infl uences.
Tension cord
In contrast to the optibelt OmEGA HP with glass cord, the 
optibelt OMEGA HL uses a signifi cantly higher strength glass 
cord. thus, the power can be further increased by up to 
25 %. The resistance to shock leads is also signifi cantly 
increased.
Teeth
the considerably increased tooth strength (compared to 
optibelt OmEGA) is made possible by the use of aramid 
fi bres in the polychloroprene compound. This imparts very 
high tooth stiffness as well as increased shear strength.
Fabric
the shear strength of the teeth is enhanced by an extremely 
tough fabric. the shape of the optibelt OmEGA teeth and 
the minimal friction fabric enable a smooth meshing of the 
belt tooth into the pulley groove. In addition, the special 
polyamide fabric is very wear resistant.
The new high performance timing belt for 
extremely high loads across the whole speed 
spectrum
Optibelt has developed this belt in the sections 8m and 
14m especially for drives with high torques and severe 
shock loads. these types of drives can often be found in 
general engineering.
For this use, the structure and the material of the timing belt 
have been optimised in such a way that highest operational 
reliability combined with optimal economic effi ciency can 
be achieved when re-designing a drive. Initially, the belt will 
be available in the 8m section. optibelt OmEGA HL timing 
belts are used in optibelt zrS HtD pulleys or in rPP timing 
belt pulleys. For applications in other pulleys, please contact 
the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
A reinforced glass tension cord is used. this innovative glass 
cord stands out due to the combination of the following, 
important characteristics:
• good resistance to shock loads
• very high dynamic resistance
• very low permanent and elastic stretch
therefore, the belt performance can be increased by an 
additional 15 %, compared to optibelt OmEGA HP. In 
contrast to an aramid cord, which also has a very high 
resistance to shock loading, the reinforced glass cord has a 
considerably lower permanent stretch during the running 
time. Aramid cord has a high permanent stretch (see 
diagram) during running. the minimal tension loss of the 
reinforced glass cord enables a keeping of the pitch and 
thus to a load which is distributed more evenly on the teeth 
during running. 
In addition, the reinforced glass cord can also be used at 
medium and high speeds while the use of the aramid cord is 
limited to low and medium speeds. In contrast to the aramid 
cord, the reinforced glass cord enables a considerable 
extension to the range of applications.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER TIMING BELTS
The high performance timing belt for fan drives in 
the oil industry 
Fan drives in the oil industry with medium and high transmis-
sion ratios are expected to meet some demanding require-
ments:
•  antistatic according to ISO 9563
•  optimised for low tooth meshing wear
•  long service life
•  maintenance-free
•  high level of efficiency
•  constant flow of air thanks to synchronous operation
•  resistant to external influences such as variations in 
temperature and moisture
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA HL 
and optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER timing belts are used in 
optibelt ZRS HTD timing belt pulleys or in optibelt ZRS RPP 
timing belt pulleys. For applications in other pulleys, please 
consult the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.

Fabric
Top layer
A durable and flexible top layer protects the main body of 
the belt. The polychloroprene top surface is reinforced with 
aramid fibres with a degree of resistance to mineral oils and 
humidity, as well as protection against wear and tear due to 
friction.
Tension cord
The tension cords are reinforced pairs of counter twisted 
glass fibres. These tension cords have very high tensile 
strength, very high flexibility and minimal stretch.
Teeth
The teeth consist of a new compound reinforced with aramid 
fibres, which guarantee high shear strength. They are 
shaped and exactly spaced in such a way that they mesh 
perfectly with the pulley grooves with minimal friction. The 
dimple in the tooth guarantees quiet running.
Fabric
The specially developed polyamide fabric stands out due to 
its extraordinarily low frictional coefficient and its low noise 
characteristics.
It also protects the teeth from early wear and tear and 
prevents tooth shear.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
optibelt OMEGA HP TIMING BELTS
Structure 
The high performance timing belt for high load, 
high speed machine drives
Compact synchronous drives are used in the whole field of 
mechanical drive engineering. High power transmission 
capability, good running characteristics and high opera-
tional safety are only some of the demands made on timing 
belts. Modern manufacturing techniques and quality 
inspections during all processing stages ensure products 
with highest reliability. optibelt OMEGA HP high perfor-
mance timing belts have been especially developed for high 
load, low and high speed drives that are evenly loaded 
without heavy shock. Improved materials and optimised 
production form the basis for this very high performance 
range.
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP and optibelt 
­OMEGA HL timing belts are used in optibelt ZRS HTD timing 
belt pulleys or in optibelt ZRS RPP timing belt pulleys. 
For applications using other pulleys, please contact the 
Optibelt Application Engineering Department.

The new high performance timing belt  
optibelt OMEGA 5M HP
In the field of the high performance timing belts the optibelt 
OMEGA 5M HP has been developed for small pulley 
diameters, short centre distances and high speeds.
The optibelt OMEGA 5M HP transmits up to 3 times the 
power of an optibelt OMEGA 5M (an increase in power  
of up to 200 %). The performance level of the optibelt 
OMEGA 5M HP roughly corresponds with the level of the 
considerably larger section optibelt OMEGA 8M – with the 
same pulley diameters.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
optibelt OMEgA TIMINg bELTs
structure 
Application example: lawn mowers
Top layer
The belt top layer consists of a fl exible polychloroprene 
compound which protects the tension cord from external 
infl uences. In addition, it offers limited resistance to mineral 
oils and humidity as well as protection from frictional wear 
and tear.
Tension cord
the tension member is composed of a pair of counter 
twisted glass fi bre cords. These tension cords have high 
tensile strength, very high fl exibility and very low stretch.
Teeth
Just like the belt top layer, the teeth consist of a polychloro-
prene compound guaranteeing high shear strength. 
the dimples in the teeth promote quiet running.
Overview of the advantages and characteristics
• synchronous speed
• highest precision
• perceptibly lower noise level due to the optibelt OMEGA tooth profi le
• use in standard HTD and RPP timing belt pulleys
• maintenance-free
• temperature resistant from –30 °C to +100 °C
• effi ciency of up to 98 %

Fabric
Fabric
the polyamide fabric protects the teeth from premature wear 
and tooth root cracking. At the same time, the low coeffi -
cient of friction lowers the operating temperature and helps 
to reduce the running noise.
High performance optibelt OmEGA timing belts are the 
result of a continuing development process. Operational 
experience with optibelt zr and optibelt HtD has been 
applied to this belt generation. Endless optibelt OmEGA 
timing belts set the standard for synchronous performance 
and for positioning drives.
The geometry of the optibelt OMEGA tooth profi le has been 
developed  to run in the established, curvilinear timing belt 
pulleys. optibelt OmEGA timing belts can be used in 3m, 
5M, 8M and 14M HTD pulley profi les. optibelt ZRS HTD 
timing belt pulleys are standard items in our range with pilot 
bores or bored for optibelt tB taper bushes. In addition, all 
OmEGA timing belts can also be used in rPP timing belt 
pulleys. Special timing belt pulleys for optibelt OmEGA 
timing belts are not required.

structure 
Fabric
In order to obtain a low level of wear on the running 
surfaces as well as achieving a high level of tooth shear 
strength, a tough, wear resistant fabric is applied to the 
outer tooth surface.
Tooth pitch, designations
optibelt zr timing belts are manufactured according to 
ISO 5296, timing belt pulleys according to ISO 5294. 
Both come in six standard profi les.
Due to the American origin of the timing belt profi le, the 
length unit is “in” for inch. the width/length codes have thus 
been derived from the imperial (inch) measurements of 
widths and lengths.

Belt layer

Fabric
Top layer
A fl exible belt backing embeds the tension element and 
supports it against the reverse idlers. the top layer consists 
of a fl exible high quality chloroprene compound. This 
protects the tension cord from oil, humidity, friction and 
wear and tear.
this top layer has some inherent resistance to mineral oils, 
but not to vegetable oils and water soluble cooling and 
cutting oils.
Tension cord
The tension cord is a continuous, spirally wound glass fi bre. 
this material has a high tensile strength and is extremely 
fl exible. The low-stretch properties of the tension cord ensure 
that the pitch of the belt corresponds to the pitch of the 
pulley – even when under strain.
Teeth
the teeth are made of a shear and wear resistant rubber 
compound vulcanised to form a unit with the belt back. the 
shape and arrangement of the teeth are such that the pulley 
engages the belt teeth precisely and with minimum friction. 
As long as six teeth or more are in mesh on the small pulley, 
the complete capacity of the timing belt can be used without 
any deduction.
tooth pitch is the distance from the centre of one tooth to the 
centre of the next measured at the pitch line, which corre-
sponds with the level of the tension cord. the pitch or datum 
diameter of the pulley is a theoretical dimension which lies 
outside the outer diameter.

Further special constructions
optibelt ZR timing belts with reinforced top 
surfaces
If the timing belt is to be used for the conveyance of various 
goods, we recommend using optibelt zr timing belts with 
reinforced top surfaces.
Please give the required overall thickness (hs) of the belt 
when ordering.
optibelt ZR timing belts with ground top surfaces
When using back bend idlers, especially when dealing with 
high belt speeds and vibration, we recommend optibelt zr 
timing belts with ground top surfaces. Available grinding 
tolerances are given in the following table 4:
PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
sTANDARD PROPERTIEs / sPECIAL DEsIgNs
optibelt ZR timing belts with angled sides
optibelt zr timing belts with angled sides can be customised 
for special applications.
Special lengths, widths, tooth pitch or open-ended versions 
of optibelt zr timing belts and the minimum order quantities 
are available on request.
All optibelt zr timing belts are oil-, heat- and cold-resistant 
as standard. Special labelling is not required.
Oil resistance
the inherent oil resistance prevents the damaging effects of 
mineral oils and greases, as long as these substances are 
not in permanent contact with the timing belt and / or are 
not present in large quantities With increased demands for 
resistance, e.g. to mineral oils, the performance of the 
optibelt zr timing belts can be improved by using special 
constructions. Please contact the optibelt Application 
Engineering Department for more details.
Temperature resistance
the timing belt can withstand ambient temperatures from 
≈ –30 °C to +100 °C. Temperatures outside this range lead 
to premature ageing and embrittlement of the timing belts 
and thus to their premature failure. the temperature resist-
ance of Optibelt zr timing belts can be extended using 
special constructions, e.g. up to +140 °C. Please contact the 
Optibelt Application Engineering Department for more 
details.
Anti-static properties
Anti-static properties enable the safe discharge of electro-
static charges. this charging can have such a strong impact 
on timing belts with insuffi cient electrical conductivity that 
there is the danger of ignition due to sparks. the use of 
anti-static timing belts requires that the properties be 
checked in accordance with ISO 9563 and is confi rmed by 
the issue of an inspection certifi cate.

Possible combinations
optibelt zr timing belts with standard or special compounds 
can be combined with other special designs. However, the 
individual properties of the special compounds cannot be 
combined with each other. For example, the properties of 
an extra heat-resistant belt cannot be combined with those 
of an antistatic belt.

LOAD FACTORS
Total load factor c2
The total load factor c2 is comprised of the basic load factor 
c0 plus two further loads c3 and c6.
Basic load factor c0
The basic load factor c0 takes into account the daily operat-
ing time, the type of drive and the prime mover. As it is 
almost impossible to put all the possible combinations of 
prime mover / driven unit / environmental conditions in a 
shortened form which conforms to standards, the service 
factors shown here are given only as a guideline. The 
classification of the work machine is dependent on the 
respective present load type.
c2 = c0 + c3 + c6
c2 ≥ MA/MN  recommended for frequent starts and stops

Additional Factors
Table 7
Fatigue correction factor c6
Speed correction factor c3
For speed increasing drives, a factor corresponding to the 
speed ratio is added to the basic load factor c0.
With frequent starts and stops or continual revers-
ing operation, the selected total load factor c2 
should be higher than the ratio between starting 
torque and nominal torque. If there is a brake on 
the prime mover the same procedure should 
apply for the braking torque, if the brake is used 
frequently. For further questions, please contact 
the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.

bELT TENsION
belt tension for optibelt OMEgA HP/optibelt 
OMEgA HL and optibelt OMEgA timing belts
For proper power transmission and for achieving an 
acceptable belt service life, the correct belt tension is of  
the utmost importance.
too low or too high belt tension will lead to the premature 
failure of the timing belts. Over tensioning often leads to 
bearing failure on the prime mover or the driven machine. 
Experience shows that unscientifi c belt tensioning methods, 
such as the “thumb pressure method”, are not suitable for 
applying the optimum tension to the drive for maximum 
effi ciency and drive/bearing life. It is therefore recommend-
ed that the correct static belt tension should be calculated 
for each drive. Due to their extremely low-stretch characteris-
tics Optibelt timing belts do not require any further tension-
ing after correct installation, if properly used.

DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES
TIMING BELTS in optibelt OMEGA Profile
Timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profiles are produced in 
a wide range of lengths and widths. Many special lengths, 
widths and designs are available. Please contact our 
Application Engineering Department for further details.
Timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profiles are produced to 
ground category G2 with a thickness tolerance of ± 0.25 mm 
as standard. If required, the belts can be ground to category 
G1 with a thickness tolerance of ± 0.13 mm.

Balancing
Processed steel pulleys need no balancing if the rim speed 
is below 30 m/s. Grey cast iron pulleys for medium speeds 
should be statically balanced according to the following 
table:
Parallelism
The teeth should run parallel to the axis of the bore with a 
tolerance of not more than 0.001 mm per millimetre width.
Conicity
The conicity may not exceed 0.001 mm per millimetre of  
the width of the driving face and at the same time should 
not exceed the permitted outside diameter tolerances.
Pulleys running at rim speeds exceeding of 30 m/s require 
dynamic balancing up to 1.8  · 10-5 Nm.

FLANgED PULLEYs / TENsION IDLERs
Maximum timing belt width
the maximum timing belt width should not exceed the pitch 
diameter of the smallest pulley in the drive.
Tension idlers
Idlers are grooved or fl at faced pulleys that do not transmit 
power within the drive system. Because they create addi-
tional bending stresses within the belt, their use should be 
used according to the following guidelines:
•  Diameter of the tension idler ≥ according to the smallest 
recommended pulley diameter for the profi le
•  Width of the idler ≥ widths of the timing belt pulleys in 
the drive
• Always install idlers in the slack side of the drive
•  Inside idlers:
≤ 40 teeth always use a timing belt pulley
> 40 teeth a fl at belt pulley can be used
•  In general, outside idlers should always be fl at faced as 
they run on the top surface of the belt
• Crowned idlers should never be used
•  Fit the tension idlers in such a way as to enable as many 
teeth as possible to mesh with the small pulley
•  Keep the arc of contact on the tension idler as small as 
possible
Flanged pulleys
The pulleys may be fi tted with fl anges on one or both sides 
to assist the smooth running of the timing belt.
If the drive centre distance is ≥ 8 dwk one pulley should be 
equipped with fl anges on both sides.
We recommend the use of standard pulleys. If this is not 
possible due to design reasons, special pulleys may be 
employed.

safety hints
Drives which are correctly designed according to geometric 
and performance aspects using Optibelt timing belts ensure 
a high level of operational safety and optimum belt life. 
It has been proved in practice that unsatisfactory service life 
is frequently due to installation and maintenance errors. 
We recommend that the following precautions be taken:
• Timing belt pulleys

the teeth should be clean and comply with standard 
specifi cations.
• Alignment

All shafts and pulleys should be aligned before belt 
installation.

maximum deviation in shaft parallel alignment:
DEsIgN sUPPORT
INsTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE
Belt width n [mm]
Angle deviation 
≤ 25
± 1°
> 25 ≤   50
± 0.5°
> 50 ≤ 100
± 0.25°
> 100
± 0.15°
• Timing belt sets

timing belts which run in pairs or in multiples on the one 
drive system must always be ordered as sets. this way it 
is guaranteed that all belts are cut from the same produc-
tion sleeve and have an identical length.
• Installation

Before installation, the drive centre distance should be 
reduced to enable the timing belts to be fi tted with 
absolutely no force. If this is not possible the timing belts 
must be fi tted together with one or both of the pulleys. 
Any use of force during the fi tting of the belt will result in 
damage to the high quality low-stretch tension cord and 
other components; this damage may not be immediately 
apparent. 

In case taper bushes are used, the studs should be 
checked after 0.5 to 1 hour via torque wrench. tighten-
ing torque values see page 91.
• Tensioning

tensioning should be carried out in accordance with the 
guidelines on page 44. Once fi tted, no further checking 
or adjustment is necessary.
• Idlers

Idlers should be avoided. If this is not possible, please 
follow our recommendations on page 112 of this manu-
al.
• Maintenance

Optibelt timing belts require virtually no maintenance if 
they are used under normal environmental conditions.

Drive design
the protective covering on both tooth faces and the resultant 
identical power transmission capability of both sides of the 
belt, allow for an unlimited distribution of the power to be 
transmitted. the maximum allowed nominal power rating 
can be transmitted from either the inner or the outer tooth 
face. With several driven pulleys the power can be distrib-
uted in any combination through both sides of the belt. 
the total power transmitted cannot, however, exceed the 
maximum permitted levels.
Example:
structure 
Tension cord
As standard belts, the tension cord consists of continuous, 
spirally wound glass fi bre. This material ensures high tensile 
strength with the minimum stretch. Exceptional fl exibility is 
achieved by embedding the cord in the centre.
Teeth
the teeth are arranged directly opposite each other and are 
manufactured from a medium hard, shear- and wear-resist-
ant rubber compound. they mesh exactly with the tooth 
groove of the pulley with minimum resistance. As long as six 
teeth or more are in mesh, the capacity of the belt is used 
optimally.
Fabric cover
Both sides of the teeth are covered with a tough, friction 
resistant fabric. This fabric with its low coeffi cient of friction 
is therefore characterised by a long operational life.
the design must be based on the nominal power values for 
standard belts (see pages 60 to 71). All available sizes on 
pages 32 to 34.
