We produce a broad range of mounted bearings from small lightweight units to large heavy-
duty units to meet a wide variety of industries and applications worldwide.
The Ceraball Bearing Series, a revolutionary style of bearing, was started by our unique
idea of combining the highest grades of ceramic and steel, and now meets various needs in
leading Japanese biochemical industries, information technology, aerospace, automotive
manufacturing, and ocean development businesses.
This catalog introduces a section of "Ceraball Bearings for special environments". We
believe this new line will help to reduce bearing maintenance as well as minimize maintenance
costs and downtime.

1 Structure and features
FYH Ball Bearing Units are manufactured to exacting
standards comprising grease sealed deep groove ball bear-
ings and housings in various forms. Self-aligning units allow
for easy installation and are supplied with grease nipples in
order to facilitate quick and convenient re-lubrication.
1.1 Structure
FYH Ball Bearing Units are constructed of hig-h carbon
chromium bearing steel and have precision honed race-
ways and riveted steel cages (Fig. 1.1).

1.2 Features
FYH Ball Bearing Units have many features and are
available in various models. A wide selection of mounted
units is offered to fit virtually any application.
1 Supreme load capacity and accuracy
FYH Ball Bearing Units feature an internal structure
identical to single row deep groove ball bearings and
bear significant radial load, as well as a great deal of
axial load in both directions. The hardened steel balls
exhibit a high degree of "roundness" and the races are
highly polished to accommodate a smoother ride at a
wide range of speeds.
2 Rational self-aligning mechanism and optimal fit
FYH Ball Bearing Units have the special ability to self-
align inside the housing because of the spherical shape
of the outer diameter of the bearing insert and the con-
cave shape of the inner diameter of the housing into
which it fits. This design allows the bearing unit to self-
adjust for shaft deviation and thereby eliminate abnormal
bearing load. Therefore, the original rated life of the
bearing can be guaranteed.
Since the spherical outside surface of the bearing is
precision ground and the spherical bore of the housing is
machined by a boring machine with great accuracy,
optimal fitting of the bearing and the housing can be
obtained, as well as superior aligning performance.
The allowable aligning angle of standard ball bearing
units is 3º, while units with covers is 1º.

3 Superior sealing performance
FYH Ball Bearing Units efficiently prevent grease from
leaking out of the interior of the bearing, and perform
extremely well at keeping contaminates, such as dust
and water, from entering. This is achieved by installing
the seal to the outer ring of the bearing and installing the
slinger to the inner ring of the bearing.
The seal is made of synthetic rubber with supreme oil
proof characteristics, and the lip of the seal contacts with
the inner ring of the bearing with optimal tension.
When operating in moist or dusty environments, the
triple lip seal unit (suffix code : L3) or a covered unit
(accessory code : C, CD, FC, FD) is recommended.
The triple lip seal unit or unit with cover helps prevent
ingress of water and dust from the outside, and extends
the rated life of the bearing.

4 Simple lubrication
FYH Ball Bearing Units are tapped to accept a grease
nipple which is also supplied with every mounted unit.
Bearings are pre-lubricated at the factory and do not
require additional grease upon installation. When operat-
ing in excessively moist, dusty, or hot environments it is
recommended that grease be supplied at regular inter-
vals. If appropriately maintained, the rated life of the
bearing can be extended.
The grease nipples that are supplied with FYH
mounted units include 1/4-28 for smaller units and 1/8 PT
for larger units. Additional styles are available upon
request.
5 Highly rigid and rugged cast iron housings
FYH Ball Bearing Units housings are designed so that
they are optimized for reduction of deformation due to
centralization of stress and load. Only the best material is
selected to be cast by a highly advanced technique or
press working technique, depending on the housing.
Since any abnormal load on the bearing is eliminated
by the housing, the life of the bearing can be extended. A
special baked on coating helps resist corrosion and
protect the surface of the housing for an extended period
of time.
6 Simple installation and handling
FYH Ball Bearing Units interchange with many differ-
ent models and can be bolted to machinery without any
modification. The exact amount of clearance is allowed
between the bore and the shaft to allow a perfect fit.
Therefore, FYH Ball Bearing Units do not require any
additional lubrication or seal installation. As a result,
handling and downtime can be drastically reduced.
Three different locking mechanisms are available :
(1) set screw
(2) eccentric locking collar
(3) tapered adapter
Mounting the bearing to the shaft can be executed
easily and securely by adopting any of these methods.
7 Series and models
FYH Ball Bearing Units are available in various series
and models.
Reliability of machinery or equipment, used together
with these units, can be improved by selecting and using
units optimal for the application and operating conditions.

2.3 Units for special use
To meet customer requests for bearings with special
purposes FYH offers a variety of bearing options to meet
their needs. Various features allow FYH bearings to work in
many non-standard environments and conditions.
The following information shows some of the ways FYH
can offer solutions to your non-standard bearing needs.
1 L (L3) units
The triple lip seal is composed of a three lip seal glued
to the steel shield plate with vulcanized adhesive. The
triple lip seal prevents dust, mud, & water from accessing
the raceway of the bearing. The triple lip ensures long
bearing life in even the most severe environmental condi-
tions.
The L3 seals are fit to the outer ring of the bearing and
do not require the insert to be handled any differently
than a standard model. The L3 seal allows for the same
amount of misalignment as a standard insert. The L3
seal retains its' sealing performance for the life of the
unit.
The L3 unit is helpful in keeping contaminant out of the
insert, prolonging life and minimizing bearing change-
outs. The L3 insert in available in the UC series as well
as the UK series.
Fig. 2.1 	Structure of L units
2 Units with covers (accessory code C, D, FC, FD)
Covers can be fitted onto most types of housings with
some machining necessary. The covers come in both
pressed steel type as well as cast iron. Covers are avail-
able in open and closed designs. The open design has a
hole with a rubber seal that allows shafting to pass
through it. The closed design would be used on a pillow
block where shafting will not pass through. The covers
help ensure that dust and other environmental contami-
nants will not reach the insert. The covers help improve
the rating life of bearing units where conditions have
caused other bearings to fail.
Open pressed steel covers use C, open cast iron
covers use FC. Closed covers use D for pressed steel
and FD for the cast iron type. Pillow blocks can have
covers on both sides, and can come in open/open or
open/closed designs.

3 High temperature / Low temperature units
(accessory code high temperature D1K2
re-lube, D9K2 pre-lube low temperature D2K2)
For applications that require bearing units to be used
at a higher or lower temperature range than our standard
models FYH offers several options. For high temperature
units that require lubrication please specify D1K2 type of
inserts. For high temperature units that do not require
lubrication specify D9K2. The D9K2 insert uses a fluoro-
grease, that allows for high heat resistance and operation
for a long period of time. Specifications of the high tem-
perature and low temperature grease units are shown in
Table 2.3.

4 High speed units (special code K3)
High speed units are used in applications where low
torque and high RPM's are necessary. These units use a
non-contact seal that allows for a free spin that cuts
down on temperature, and allows for low torque start-up.
These units are often used in the printing and textile
machinery applications.
5 Units for blowers (special code S5)
Ball bearing units for blowers must meet the demands
of high speed rotation, low vibration, low noise and
decreased temperature output.
To meet these performance needs FYH produces the
S5 series of units for blowers. These units use non-
contact seals, as well as an improved machining accu-
racy to cut down on heat, noise, and vibration.
Fig. 2.3 	Structure of bearing units for blowers
6 Clean series units
Our clean series unit is a compact design that allows
for light conveying in many manufacturing applications.
The setscrew design allows for easy installation, as well
as reversing. The housing is made of a special alloy, and
the insert is zinc plated. Covers coated with rubber
increase adhesion with the housing and can be ordered
separately in both open and closed designs. The clean
series comes in metric sizes only from 10 mm to 30 mm.
They are available in both pillow block and 2-bolt flange.
7 Stainless steel series (special code S6)
Our stainless steel series is designed for food, phar-
maceutical and other applications that experience fre-
quent wash down or chemical splash. The stainless steel
inserts come with USDA approved food grade grease
(H1) standard. The insert is composed of 440 grade
stainless steel. Stainless covers are available for these
units to give additional protection. The operating tem-
perature range is from −20 ºC to +100 ºC.
8 Ceraball bearing units (special code Y1 to Y7)
Ceraball bearings have Silicon Niteride (Si3N4)
ceramic balls, and ensure stable performance for long
periods of time even in special operating environments.
These environments include : high temperature, corro-
sion, high speed rotation, low torque, and vacuum.
Y1 type (high speed rotation)
· This bearing is designed for applications with high
speed rotation in which the dN value exceeds
200 000. This is made possible by the lightweight
ceramic balls.
Y2 type (standard)
· This is the standard model in the Ceraball series. It is
designed to withstand temperatures of 250 ºC. It
resists corrosive conditions such as heated steam,
chemical and solvents. It can be used in clean room
conditions due to its' low dust and low torque proper-
ties. It will also perform well in insulated or vacuum
conditions.
Y3 type (extra high temperature)
· This bearing is designed for environments that experi-
ence temperature in excess of 300 ºC, and where
greasing is hard to execute. For these applications
FYH offers the Y3 type of bearing with solid lubricant
used for the cage. These bearings are designed to
withstand temperatures of up to 450 ºC.
Y7 type (anticorrosion type)
· This bearing is designed to perform in areas where
standard bearings fail. This bearing is suited to cor-
rosive environments where bearings may be exposed
to solvents, or underwater applications. This bearing
is best for light loads and low speed rotation.

3.3 Selection of bearings from
a maintenance viewpoint
FYH ball bearing units require little if any maintenance
when being used in general operating conditions. Periodic
checks will help ensure that the bearings are performing as
required. The periodic checks should be based upon your
application. Bearings operating in a clean environment with
low load, and low RPM need to be checked less often than
units in a dirty environment, with higher loads. Care should
be taken to make sure that the bearings are being properly
lubricated and that the right kind of grease is being used. If
great axial load will be present a shouldered shaft should
be used. If the bearing environment is wet or dusty a cover
of L type of insert should be used. In an environment
exposed to high or low temperature the type of grease and
the material of the seals must be taken fully into consider-
ation.

4 Rating life of bearings
When ball bearing units are installed and operated on a
piece of machinery eventually a failure will occur. The
period of operation until the unit cannot be used due failure
is called the bearing life.
Bearing failure is caused by two main reasons. The first
is fatigue of bearing material, and the second is degrada-
tion of grease. The life is figured on whichever fail first.
Proper bearing lubrication will eliminate grease degradation
and allow the full bearing life to be achieved. If the bearing
units are run without replenishment of the grease the
bearing life will have to be factored by either the grease life
or the bearing life. During installation care must be taken
not to dent or crack the insert. Proper bearing maintenance
and lubrication will ensure long bearing life.
4.1 Basic rating life and basic load
rating
4.1.1 Basic rating life
When a bearing is rotated under load, the raceways, the
surfaces of the inner and outer rings, and the rolling ele-
ments are exposed to load continuously. Damages such as
scaling appear eventually on the material (flaking or peel-
off). The total rotating frequency until the damage appears
is called the "fatigue limit of the bearing". Fatigue limit of the
bearing can vary greatly even if the bearings have the
same structure, dimensions, materials, machining methods,
and are operated under the same conditions.
To solve this if a group of the same bearings operating
under the same conditions the total rotating frequency of
90% of the bearings operating with no damage due to
rotating fatigue (life of 90% reliability) is called the basic
load rating.
4.1.2 Basic load rating
Dynamic ratings are determined by placing a pure radial
load on a radial bearing or by placing a central axial load
on a thrust bearing. The dynamic rating is the load that the
bearing will withstand for one million cycles before failure of
the bearing.
These ratings are referred to as the basic dynamic
radial load rating (Cr) or the basic dynamic axial load
rating (Ca) These values are shown in the catalog.
In the ball bearings for ball bearing units, it is indicated
as the basic dynamic radial load rating (Cr), and the value
is shown in the dimensional table.
4.2 Calculation of rating life
The relation between the basic rating life, the basic
dynamic load rating, and the dynamic equivalent load of the
ball bearings for ball bearing type units are indicated in
Formula (4.1). If the ball bearing unit is being used at a
fixed rotating speed, the life is indicated as time. This is
shown in Formula (4.2).

4 Rating life of bearings

4.2.1 Correction of basic load rating due to
temperature
If a ball bearing unit is used at a high temperature the
physical composition of the bearing material is changed,
leading to decreased hardness. This decreased hardness
leads to the basic dynamic load rating being reduced. Once
the structure of the bearing material has been changed, it
will remain this way for the life of the unit, even when it
returns to room temperature.
When using a ball bearing unit at 150 ºC or more, the
basic load rating must be corrected by multiplying the basic
dynamic load rating shown in the dimensional table by the
temperature factor shown in Table 4.1.

4.2.2 Corrected rating life
The basic L10 rating life shown in Formula (4.1) is the
fatigue life of a bearing with 90% reliability ; there are
circumstances where bearings need greater reliability. The
bearing life may be extended by using special materials.
Other conditions including lubrication may influence the
bearing life.
The corrected rating life is found by taking the basic
rating life and using the points in Formula (4.6) into consid-
eration.

(2) Bearing characterization factor a2
The material make-up of a bearing can have an affect
on its' basic rating life. Factors that can influence the
bearing include : bearing material (type of steel), produc-
tion procedures, and bearing design. Bearing character-
ization is shown as the factor a2.
FYH ball bearing inserts use high quality vacuum
degassed bearing steel as standard material. This mate-
rial allows for a longer rating life. For FYH ball bearing
units the bearing characterization factor a2 is 1 (a2 = 1).
When bearings with special materials are used for a
longer fatigue limit the characterization factor can be
shown as a2 being greater than 1 (a2 > 1).
(3) Operating condition factor a3
Operating conditions may directly influence the life of
the bearing (especially proper or improper greasing). The
basic rating life should be corrected using the operating
condition factor a3. If lubrication is being maintained the
factor a3 = 1. If excellent re-lubrication practices are
being maintained the factor a3 > 1 should be applied.
If any of the following operating conditions are appli-
cable the condition should be applied as a3 < 1.
(1) Kinematical viscosity of lubricant during operation is low
.................................. Ball bearing : 13 mm2
/s or less,
roller bearing : 20 mm2
/s or less
(2) Rotating speed is low ................ dmn : 10 000 or less
Remark dm (Pitch dia. of ball set) × n (Rotating speed)
(3) Foreign matters are mixed in lubricant
Even if the bearing characterization factor is improved
i.e., a2 > 1, the life of the bearing must still be downrated
if the combination, a2 × a3 > 1.

At some point continuing to use a ball bearing unit does
not lead to economical operation. Operating conditions, the
type of bearing units used, and the type of machine the
bearing is used on all influence the lifetime of the bearing.

4.3 Grease life
The grease life for ball bearing units is influenced by : the
level of the load, rotating speed of the bearing, and the
operating temperature.

Loads applied to bearings come from various consider-
ations. These include the weight of objects supported by
the bearing and any resulting shock or dynamic load there-
from, the force exerted by gears and drive belts to pull a
load and overcome friction between moving surfaces, e.g.,
the friction between a conveyor belt and the conveyor
frame. In many cases, these loads cannot be determined
by a simple calculation.
Since these loads are often fluctuating in intensity, it is
difficult to determine the exact magnitude of these loads
prior to actual lab or field measurements on the machine
involved.
However, in order to approximate the loads involved prior
to putting a machine into operation, the following technique
may be used. This technique uses multiplication factors that
have been determined empirically from sample measure-
ments taken on actual machines in operation.
5.1 Loads applied to bearings
5.1.1 Load factor
Even if the static radial load and the axial load can be
accurately calculated, the actual loads are generally
greater than this. This is because of vibration and shock
loads during actual machine operation.
To find the loads actually applied to a bearing, multiply
the values determined for the static load by the following
load factors.
F = fw · Fc ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ (5.1)

5.1.2 Loads from belts or chain drives
The load calculated for the bearing is equal to the tensile
load of the belt. However this load must be multiplied by the
load factor ( fw) which accounts for vibration and impact of
the machine and a belt factor ( fb) which accounts for the
vibration and impact generated through the belt.
When calculating loads for a chain drive, use the same
factor ( fb) as used for belt drives.

Gear transmissions have a load in the tangential direc-
tion (Kt), a load in the radial direction (Kr) and an axial load
(Ka). Different types of gears are calculated differently.

accuracy of machining and the finish of the gears.

5.2 Distribution of bearing load
In order to determine the radial load distribution to each
bearing attached to a shaft, use the procedure shown
below. Use the load factors shown in Table 5.1 to account
for vibration and impact.
Often a bearing bears an axial load component in addi-
tion to the radial component. In this case calculate the total

root of the sum of the squares of each load.

5.3 Dynamic equivalent load
In many cases, a bearing is exposed to the combined
vector load of both radial and axial load components. Also it
is used under more severe conditions of vibration and
impact loads. In this case a direct comparison to the
dynamic load rating is not appropriate.
In such a case, find the load equivalent to a direct radial
(only) load and compare this with the basic dynamic load
rating.
The converted virtual load is called dynamic equivalent
load (P).
5.3.1 Calculation of dynamic equivalent load
The dynamic equivalent radial load (Pr) of a bearing that
bears radial and axial loads as well as vibration and impact
is found by the following formula.

5.3.2 Average dynamic equivalent load
in the case of fluctuating loads
If the level or direction of the load applied to a bearing is
fluctuating, it is necessary to find the average dynamic
equivalent load to calculate the bearing life.

dynamic equivalent load under various types of fluctuating
conditions.

5.4 Basic static load rating and static
equivalent load
5.4.1 Basic static load rating
If a bearing is exposed to excessive static or impact load
even when running at low rotational speed, partial perma-
nent deformation occurs to the contact surface of the
raceways of the bearing. The amount of permanent defor-
mation increases with increased loads, and at some point,
the bearing will no longer rotate smoothly.
The basic static load rating of a bearing is the static load
that generates the calculataed contact stresses shown
below at the center of the contact surfaces of the raceways.
(1) Automatic aligning ball bearing .......... 4 600 MPa
(2) Other ball bearings
(ball bearing for unit is included) ........ 4 200 MPa
(3) Roller bearing .................................... 4 000 MPa
The total permanent deformation that occurs to the
raceways and the balls under the above critical contact
stresses is 0.000 1 times the diameter of the ball.
In ball bearing units, this is indicated as the basic static
radial load rating (C0r) and these values are shown in the
dimensional tables.

5.4.2 Static equivalent loads
Static equivalent load is the equivalent of the combined
(vectored) load converted to the equivalent direct radial
load. Static may be considered to be under conditions of no
rotation conditions or very low rotating speeds.
Static equivalent radial load (P0r) can be calculated by
the formula below.

5.4.3 Safety factor
The static equivalent load that can be withstood by a
bearing, in addition to the above considerations, sometimes
is dependent upon unforeseen conditions in the operating
environment. Therefore a safety factor is always built in to
insure success in the application.

find the static radial load rating of bearing required C0r.
C0r = fs · Pr = 2 × 12 = 24 (kN)

Example 8 Calculating grease life
Find the grease life in the case that pillow type unit
UCP204J (bearing UC204) under the following conditions :
radial load Fr is 1 kN (Fr = 1 kN), and rotating speed n is
800 min−1 (n = 800 min−1). Note that the radial load Fr
includes load factor and belt factor. Operating temperature
of the bearing should be 40 ºC.

Example 7 Calculating bearing life in case
of use at high temperature
Find the bearing life if the heat resistant pillow type unit
(UCP215JD1K2) is operated under the following condi-
tions : operating temperature is 175 ºC, radial load Fr is
4 kN (Fr = 4 kN), and the rotating speed n is 800 min−1
(n = 800 min−1). Note that the radial load Fr includes load
factor and gear factor.

(2) If a bearing unit is operated at 175 ºC, grease is
degraded faster, and it cannot be used without lubri-
cation. Supply grease at intervals specified in Table
14.4.
(3) If the shaft is extended excessively, install a bearing
unit on the identical shaft on the fixed side (position-
ing of shaft), and install another bearing unit on the
free side
(see "9 Design of shaft and base").
Example 9 Calculating life of bearing units
in case of non-lubrication
Find the life of a bearing unit in the case that it is oper-
ated under the conditions shown in Example 8, but without
lubrication.

(2) Compare the grease life L shown in Example 8 to the
rating life of bearings Lh. Then, grease life L is shorter
than the bearing rating life. Therefore, life of a bear-
ing unit should be the same as the grease life L,
34 800 hours (L = 34 800 hours).

6 Allowable rotating speed
6.1 Allowable rotating speed
The rotational speed of a bearing is limited by the tem-
perature increase, mainly due to friction. When the bearing
reaches the speed limits shown below, it will seize if oper-
ated continuously at these levels.
The limiting rotational speed is the maximum speed at
which the bearing can be safely operated continuously.
These allowable rotational speeds of a ball bearing unit
is dependent upon the dimensions of the bearing, type of
seal and the fit of the bearing inner ring to the shaft.
Table 6.1 shows the standard allowable rotating speeds
of ball bearing units.

Remarks 1. Allowable rotating speed of the units with covers is 80% of the value shown in the table above.
2. If a bearing unit is used with excessively loose fi tting, allowable rotating speed must be corrected by multiplying
it by the fi tting factor fc shown in Table 6.2.

bearing specifications
6.2 Rotational speed adjustment due
to shaft fit
Normally for easier installation of a bearing to the shaft, a
clearance fit is used. The amount of clearance must be
factored in to determine the maximum allowable rotational
speed. As rotational speed is increased, this clearance fit
must be tighter.
Table 6.2 shows the factor that must be used to correct
the allowable rotational speed. The maximum rotational
speed is determined by multiplying the speed found in
Table 6.1 by the factors below. This table includes the multi-
plying factors for set screw units as well as units with
adapters and eccentric locking collars. Due to the charac-
teristics of units with adapters, a loose fit, h8 or h9, is
acceptable. Likewise the eccentric locking collar does not
lend itself to loose tolerances and an h5 or j5 fit is recom-
mended to achieve the maximum speed.

7.1 Operating temperature range
The operating temperature of a ball bearing unit depends
on the type of grease, the material of the seal and the
internal clearance of the bearing.
FYH Ball Bearing Units are available in high temperature
(D1K2) and low temperature (D2K2) series, in addition to
the standard models to allow selection of the right bearing
for your operational temperature (see Table 2.3).
The correct unit must be chosen for temperature range
and it is equally important to use the specified grease
according to the specified schedule.
7.2 Operating temperature and internal
clearance of bearings
When bearings are operated in a high ambient tempera-
ture environment or when the operating temperature is high
because of rotational speed, differential expansion rates
occur within the bearing components. This causes higher
friction, grease breakdown and eventual seizure.
If the temperature difference between the inner and outer
ring is known or can be approximated, then the following
Formula (7.1) may be applied.
Under these conditions, decrease in the internal clear-
ance must be calculated, and the internal clearance of
bearings needs to be selected properly.
St1 = α · De · 3t ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ (7.1)
Whereas,
St1 : Decrease in the internal clearance of bearings

tures of the bearing inner ring and the bearing
outer ring can be found by formula, mm

Diameter series 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ De 	0.9 D
D : Nominal bearing outer dia., mm
3t : Difference in temperatures of bearing inner ring
and outer ring, ºC
If a ball bearing unit is used in a high temperature envi-
ronment, an abnormal load will be result due to thermal
expansion of the shaft. This must be compensated for by
allowing free movement of one side of the shaft.

8 Strength of housings
FYH bearings can withstand very high loads due to the
design and the usage of only high quality material. How-
ever when high static or impact loads are encountered, the
load capacity of the bearing must be determined.
The housing design is such that it can withstand loads
from any angle ; however the bearing is strongest with a
direct downward load through the base of the bearing. For
other load directions, the allowable load must be deter-
mined for that direction.
Rigidity of the base and flatness of the mounting surface
also influence the housing strength. The equipment
designer or installer must examine and do calculations for
the complete supporting structure of the bearing.
8.1 Strength of cast iron housings
Although gray cast iron has many superior characteris-
tics, it may fail under impact loads, particularly in a low
temperature environment.
Table 8.1 shows the applicable design safety factors for
gray cast iron. Fig. 8.1 to 8.8 show the static rupture
strength of the various housing types.

8.2 Strength of cast steel housings
Cast steel housings should be selected where high
rupture strength and superior impact resistance are
required.
FYH manufactures a cast steel pillow block housing
(P200sc, P300sc) series.
To determine the allowable load of a cast steel housing,
find the static rupture strength of a steel housing from Fig.
8.2 and apply the safety factors for steel shown in Table
8.2.

8.3 Strength of stamped steel housings
The precisely formed stamped steel housing is very rigid,
but it is not as strong as cast iron or cast steel housings.
Therefore, it will not support loads to the maximum rating of
the bearing itself and must be down rated per Table 8.3.

ings (recommended)

FYH supplies stainless steel housings (SP-H1, SPA-H1,
SF- H1, SFL-H1, ST-H1, SP, SFL).
Table 8.4 shows the safety factors for stainless steel
products. As for the basic values of the static rupture
strength of SP-H1, SPA-H1, SF-H1,SFL-H1, ST-H1 type
housings, apply P200 of Fig. 8.1, PA200 of Fig. 8.4, F200
of Fig. 8.6, FL200 of Fig. 8.7 and T200 of Fig. 8.8. For the
basic values of the static rupture strength of the SP and
SFL type housings, see P000 of Fig. 8.9 and FL000 of Fig.

9.1 Design of shaft
For optimal performance of a ball bearing unit and for
maintenance free operation for a long time, the selection of
the shaft is very important. The shaft should be of sufficient
tensile strength, straight, scratch-free and no burrs should
be left.
9.1.1 Dimensional accuracy of shaft
(1) Dimensional tolerance of shaft used
for set screw bearings
For bearings with set screws, a relatively looser class
of fit makes assembly easier and is perfectly acceptable
at low operating speeds. The clearance fit between the
i.d. of the bearing inner ring and the shaft must be
decreased as the rotational speed is increased.
Table 9.1 shows the guidelines for the tolerance class
for the rotational speed of the bearing with set screws.
If the bearing with set screws is exposed to a heavy

(2) Dimensional tolerances of shafts for blowers
(used with set screw bearings)
In bearings used in blowers (special code : S5),
machining accuracy of the internal bearing clearance
(C2) is required to reduce vibration and noise during
operation.
Therefore, the shaft tolerance classes shown in Table
9.4 are recommended for bearings with set screws.

bearings (set screw type) for blowers

(3) Dimensional tolerance of shaft used
with tapered bore bearings
Since tapered bore bearings are fixed to the shaft with
an adapter, a looser fit is allowable since the adapter
provides excellent concentricity. This makes mounting of
the bearing to the shaft much easier.
Table 9.5 shows the dimensional tolerance of the shaft
used with tapered bore bearings (with adapters).

(4) Dimensional tolerance of shaft
with eccentric locking collar
Eccentric lock bearings have a greater clearance
(more eccentricity) between the shaft and the inner ring
of the bearing when installed. Therefore the shaft toler-
ances must be tighter (h5 or j5) to reduce the clearance
(eccentricity). Therefore the same clearance fits are
recommended as with blower bearings, Table. 9.4.
9.1.2 	Dimensions of shouldered shafts
When using a set screw or eccentric lock bearing which
is exposed to a high axial load, excessive vibration or
impact, a shouldered shaft may be used. The inner ring of
the bearing is then tightened in place with a nut, if the shaft
is threaded or with a locking ring otherwise.
Table 9.6 shows the shoulder diameter and the fillet
radius of the shouldered shaft.

9.1.3 High temperature applications
In general, two or more bearing units are used per shaft.
If the distance between the bearings is small, or if the
temperature change of the shaft is small, the both bearings
may be fixed in position.
However, if the distance between the bearings is large
and the shaft is exposed to heat, then only one bearing
should be fixed and the opposing bearing must be free to
float in the axial direction.
This is because shaft expansion due to temperature
change of the shaft causes a high axial load and failure of
fixed bearings. The amount of shaft expansion due to
temperature change may be calculated by Formula (9.1).
38 = α · 3t · l ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ (9.1)
Whereas,
38 : Expansion of shaft, mm
α : Linear expansion coeffi cient of shaft
in the case of ordinary steel, 11~12 × 10−6
3t : Temperature increase, ºC
l : Installation distance of unit, mm
Proper installation procedures for a shaft exposed to
temperature changes are shown below.
(1) Installation with a dog point set screw
on the free side
To accommodate expansion in the axial direction, the
bearing must be installed so that the shaft can move
freely in the axial direction.
To accomplish this, the shaft must be grooved for full
dog point set screw (special code : G6). This is on the
free side only. The dog point screw allows free movement
in the axial direction and provides force to rotate the
bearing in the radial direction.
Fig. 9.1 shows an example of the structure of a bear-
ing with a key groove on the shaft and a full dog point set
screw. Table 9.7 shows the dimensions of the key groove
for the full dog point set screw.
The tolerance class of the shaft to be used is h7.
If the temperature of the shaft is higher than that of the
bearing, then a looser fit tolerance class is specified.
When using this method to allow for free expansion,
there is the possibility of fretting corrosion between the
shaft and the inner race. In order to prevent fretting corro-
sion, a high temperature grease must be applied to the
inner ring of the bearing and the shaft prior to installation.

(2) Installation of cartridge type units
on the free side
If the rotational speed is high or the bearing is exposed
to high vibration, the cartridge type unit is recommended
on the free side. In this case the housing of the cartridge
unit is free to move and the bearing insert is rigidly
attached to the shaft.
Fig. 9.2 shows the required structure for the cartridge
type unit on the free side.
Fig. 9.2 	Use of cartridge type units on free side
If, in addition to the expansion of the shaft, the ball
bearing itself is exposed to heat, then a calculation of the
decrease in internal clearances of the bearing must be
made. The appropriate bearing internal clearance must
be specified. (see "7 Operating temperature and bear-
ing specifications").
9.2 Mounting base design
9.2.1 Rigidity of base and flatness of mounting
surface
If rigidity of the base on which a ball bearing unit is to be
mounted is not sufficient or the flatness of the mounting
surface is poor, then vibration or abnormal noise may occur
to the bearing during operation. This will lead to failure
since the strength of the housing is less since it is not
properly supported.
The base must be properly machined accurately to
eliminate deformation of the housing.
Fig. 9.3 shows the recommended values for flatness of
the mounting surface on which the ball bearing unit is to be
installed.

Max. : L / 1 000 mm
9.2.2 Mounting cartridge type units
in high temperature applications
Cartridge units are designed to fit into an accurately
bored cylindrical opening in the mounting base. Under
ordinary operating conditions, H7 is an adequate choice for
the tolerance class of the cylindrically bored hole.
In instances in which both the bearing and the shaft are
hot, select G7 as the tolerance class of the cylindrical bore.
If the bearing is exposed to excessive vibration or impact,
then an even tighter tolerance class must be specified.
Table 9.8 shows the dimensional requirements for the
cylindrical bore.

11 Accuracy and internal clearance
Accuracy of a ball bearing unit is specified in JIS B 1558
(ball bearings for ball bearing units) and JIS B 1559 (hous-
ing for ball bearing unit). FYH produces products conform-
ing to these standards.
11.1 Accuracy of bearings
Table 11.1 to Table 11.4 show the accuracy of a ball
bearings for ball bearing units.
Ball bearings for blower unit (special code : S5) are
produced with higher accuracy than standard models (see

11.2 Accuracy of housings
This section details the tolerance specifications of the
inner diameter of the spherical bore of FYH housings.
These values determine how tight or how loose the bearing
fits inside the housing.
Table 11.6 shows the tolerance of the diameter of the
spherical bore of housings.
Standard tolerance for mounted units, between the outer
diameter of the bearing and the inner diameter of the
housing, is a class J7 intermediate fit.
A class H7 tolerance allows greater clearance for appli-
cations where minor shaft alignment constantly occurs or in
environments where higher temperatures can cause ther-
mal expansion. An anti-rotation pin on the outer ring of the
bearing is supplied with these units to prevent the outer
ring of the bearing from spinning inside the housing.
A class K7 tolerance allows less clearance and is recom-
mended to prevent the outer ring of the bearing from rotat-
ing inside the housing.
Fig. 11.1 shows examples of housing dimensions relative
to installation position with tolerance values.

11.3 Internal bearing clearance
Internal bearing clearance is defined as the allowable
space between the bearing balls and the raceways. The
degree of internal clearance, referred to as "operation
clearance", greatly influences operational life of the bearing
as well as characteristics of heat, noise, and vibration.
If the clearance is exceptionally tight between the shaft
and the inner ring of the bearing then expansion of the
inner ring must be taken into consideration and the correct
ball clearance should be selected. Transmission heat from
the shaft is also a factor to consider when determining the
correct amount of ball clearance (see "7 Operating tem-
perature and bearing specifications").
Table 11.8 shows the internal clearance applicable to
specific operating conditions and Table 11.9 shows the
available options of internal clearance.

12 Materials
12 Materials
12.1 Bearing material
Ball bearing inserts are comprised of inner and outer
rings, balls, and riveted ball cages all of which is made of
the highest quality of bearing steel.
These bearings possess the following features.
(1) High elastic limit to resist strong opposing force
(2) High rolling fatigue strength to allow for heavy loads
(3) Superior hardness
(4) Superior wear resistance
(5) Superior toughness against impact and shock loads
(6) Superior stability of dimensional tolerances
High carbon chrome bearing steel specified in JIS (Japa-
nese Industrial Standards) for the bearing components are
utilized.
To increase reliability and reduce contamination within
the material, a vacuum degassing process is executed to
reduce non-metallic elements and any oxygen in the steel.
After the bearing is assembled it is heat tempered and
quenched until the hardness reaches 60HRC.
Table 12.1 shows the chemical components of high
carbon chrome bearing steel. Stainless steel bearing
inserts (suffix : S6) utilize superior corrosion resistant JIS
certified stainless steel.
Riveted steel ball cages are made of JIS certified cold-
rolled steel and steel strip which is shown in Table 12.2.
12.2 Housing material
Housings are mainly made of gray cast iron, cast carbon
steel, and stamped steel. Gray cast iron is the most popular
choice for mounted units because of its optimal character-
istics of vibration absorption, high strength, and excellent
heat dissipation.
Table 12.3 shows the mechanical properties of gray cast
iron.
Nodular graphite cast iron (FCD450-10 of JIS G 5502)
may be used in addition to these materials.
If superior strength is required for the housings for ball
bearing units, select carbon steel cast steel products with
higher rupture strength, carbon steel cast steel, or general
structural rolled steel with higher strength against impact.
For the material of housings of the clean series unit, zinc
alloy die-cast is used, and stainless steel cast steel prod-
ucts are used for housings of the stainless series unit. Cold
rolled sheet steels and steel strips are used as the material
of housings for the steel plate unit.
Table 12.4 to 12.8 show the mechanical properties of
these housing materials.
Nodular graphite cast iron (FCD450-10 of JIS G 5502)
may be used, as well as these materials.

13.1 Bearing friction torque
Bearing friction torque is the synthesis of rolling friction
between the balls, inner and outer rings, sliding friction
between the balls and the cages, agitating resistance of
lubricants, and friction resistance of the seal.
The specific amount of friction torque is influenced by the
particular bearing model, dimensions, bearing load, rotat-
ing speed, and lubricating conditions.
Bearings with triple-lip seals and open cover seals will
have a greater friction torque and overall greater friction
resistance.
Friction torque for bearings can be found by the formulas
below.
M = Mp + Mk ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ (13.1)

Whereas,
M : Friction torque of bearing, mN · m
Mp : Friction torque of sections changed by load,
mN · m
Mk : Friction torque of sections changed by rotating
speed, mN · m
l : Friction coeffi cient (0.001 5 to 0.002)
P : Load applied to bearings, N
d : Nominal bearing bore dia., mm
Note that the agitating resistance of lubricants and the
friction resistance of the seals are difficult to calculate since
the resistance fluctuates with speed.

torque of the typical ball bearing unit.

13.2 Bearing temperature increase
The increase in temperature of the bearing is repre-
sented as heat energy converted from friction torque in the
bearing during operation. The temperature of the bearing
during operation increases in proportion to the amount of
friction torque, and friction torque increases in proportion to
the increase in bearing load.
The increase in temperature of the bearing depends on
the heating value generated by friction in the bearing and
the amount of heat discharged from the bearing and hous-
ing in which it is mounted. Therefore, the temperature level
of the bearing is influenced by the environmental conditions
of the location in which the bearing unit is installed (quality
of heat radiation environment).
Temperature of the bearing unit increases gradually after
startup of operation and reaches the maximum level after
one or two hours if no abnormalities occur. Then it
decreases slightly and enters a steady state (see Fig.
13.2).
In this manner, if the operating conditions are not
changed, bearing temperature will remain virtually con-
stant, and measurement of the temperature and assump-
tion of the bearing status are enabled.

Fig. 13.2 	Example of temperature measurement

Increase in temperature during operation of the bearing
depends on the type of seal used in the bearing as well as
friction torque.
Increase in temperature of triple-lip bearings (suffix code
: L3) is greater than that of the standard model, and that of
the non-contact seal (suffix code : K3, S5) is lower than the
standard model. Bearings for blowers and other high-speed
applications are equipped with non-contact seals, with
grease or oil, for high-speed operation as well as reduction
of heat, vibration, and noise.

13.3 Dustproof and waterproof
performance
FYH executes various tests to check dustproof and
waterproof performance of different models of bearings.
Representative results are shown below.
13.3.1 Dust sprinkle rotating test
(dust preventive performance)
In this test, dust is sprinkled directly on the bearing as it
is operating in a rotating drum machine. Performance and
dust resistance for various sealing mechanisms are judged
based on this test.

Fig. 13.3 	Example of result of dust sprinkle
rotating test (dust proof performance)
The standard single-lip bearing exhibited abnormal noise
after about 500 hours of operation, and ingress of dust was
found.
On the other hand, no abnormality was found in both the
triple-lip bearing (suffix code : L3) or the covered unit (suffix
code : C) even after 3 000 hours of operation, and therefore

Standard FYH bearings are equipped with double-point
setscrews which offer secure tightness to the shaft. Addi-
tional styles of setscrews are also available to meet a range
of purposes and operating conditions (see Table 14.1).

Double point
(no indication)
Double point (G7)
Locking finish
The cone point at the center
of the screw combined with
the round point at the outer
edge provide excellent shaft
contact and greatly reduce
fitting error. A nylon film is
fused to the thread surface
to prevent the screw from
loosening during operation.
Prevent looseness with
elastic force of nylon fi lm
fused to the thread surface.
Pointed (G4) 	The cone point setscrew
has a 90º angle and fi ts a
drilled cone seat in the
shaft. It allows correct
positioning on the shaft and
prevents shaft movement in
an axial direction.
Full dog point cap (G6) 	The full dog point setscrew
fi ts into the keyed groove in
the shaft and allows for
expansion and contraction
of the shaft.
Shown below are installation procedures for bearing
units with setscrews.
(1) Inspect the unit to ensure that the rigidity of the base,
flatness of the mounting surface, and tolerance of the
shaft meet the required standards. Check the shaft for
bends, burrs, and other flaws.
(2) Make sure that the tip of the setscrew does not
exceed the bearing bore diameter surface.
(3) Fit the bearing unit onto the shaft and slide it to the
specified position. In order to secure a tight fit, press-fit
the bearing unit to the shaft with a press, cold-fit by
cooling the shaft, or shrink-fit the bearing unit by warm-
ing it with an air bath (100 ºC or less). Avoid hitting the
bearing with a hammer to press-fit the bearing to the
shaft.
(4) Align the bearing unit to the specified position on the
base and affix it with washers, if necessary, and bolts
(Fig. 14.4). Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to
the housing to the specified torque setting. For mount-
ing bolt torque specifications, see Appendix table 2 in
the back of this catalog.
One of the predominate features of FYH bearing units is
their simplicity of handling and installation. It is of the
utmost important that these units are handled and installed
correctly to ensure reliable performance.
14.1 Installation
14.1.1 Installation of setscrew units
When installing setscrew units, it is important to tighten
the setscrews to the shaft with the specified torque.
If the unit is mounted in an environment where it is
exposed to impact or vibration, or if the shaft is rotated in
normal and reverse directions, or if rotation is started and
stopped frequently and repeatedly, then grind or drill the
surface of the shaft where it is contacted by the setscrew
with a file or drill in order to create a flat seat (Fig. 14.1) or
drilled seat (Fig. 14.2). This will significantly improve the
tightening effect of the setscrews.

(for improvement in set screw tightening effect)
90º
Fig. 14.2 	Drilled seat provided for shaft
(for improvement in set screw tightening effect)
If the unit is exposed to great load or excessive vibration,
another option is to use a shouldered shaft and tighten the
inner ring of the bearing with a shaft nut.
For dimensions of the shouldered shaft, see "9 Design
of shaft and base".

(5) Tighten both of the setscrews on the inner ring to the
specified torque setting (Fig. 14.5). For setscrew torque
specifications, see Appendix table 3 in the back of this
catalog.
Fig. 14.5 	Tightening of set screws
(6) Turn the shaft by hand and tighten the setscrews of
all other bearings on the same shaft to the specified
torque setting.
(7) Finally, turn the shaft by hand and make sure that it
rotates without any problems.
14.1.2 Installation of adapter style units
Adapter units, comprised of an adapter sleeve, locknut,
and washer, can be installed into environments where they
are exposed to excessive vibration and impact.
It is of great importance that these units are properly
mounted. If the locknut is not properly tightened, the sleeve
may be loose which could lead to slippage and wear on the
shaft or bearing. Conversely, if the locknut is over-tight-
ened, the inner ring of the bearing can expand and reduce
internal ball clearance which could cause excessive heat
and premature failure.
Installation procedures for adapter style bearings are
shown below.
(1) Inspect the unit to ensure that the rigidity of the base,
flatness of the mounting surface, and tolerance of the
shaft meet the required standards. Check the shaft for
bends, burrs, and other flaws.
(2) Slide the adapter sleeve onto the shaft where the
bearing unit will be installed.
If the sleeve is too tight, place a screwdriver in the
slotted portion of the sleeve and expand the slot to
open the sleeve.
(3) Slide the bearing unit over the shaft and onto the
adapter sleeve, then place a cylindrical reinforcing
place against the inner ring of the front side of the
bearing. Seat the adapter sleeve by lightly tapping all
around the backside of the sleeve (Fig. 14.6).
Fig. 14.6 	Fitting adapter sleeve to bearing with
tapered bore

plate
(4) Attach the lock washer so that the tab fits into the slot
in the sleeve, and, making sure the tapered side is
facing the bearing, tighten the locknut on the sleeve by
hand.
(5) Align the bearing unit to the specified position on the
base and affix it with washers, if necessary, and bolts.
Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to the housing
to the specified torque setting. For mounting bolt torque
specifications, see Appendix table 2 in the back of this
catalog.
(6) Use a torque wrench to tighten the locknut to the
correct specification (Fig. 14.7). For locknut torque
specifications, see Appendix table 4 in the back of this
catalog.

(7A) For pillow block housings, loosen the mounting bolts
and adjust the unit axially while rotating the shaft by
hand. Then re-tighten the mounting bolts to the correct
specification.
(7B) For flange block housings, the position of the unit
must be in the correct axial position in relation to the
shaft, so take extra care to properly align them before
completing installation.
(8) Bend one of the tabs on the washer so that it fits into
one of the slots on the locknut (Fig. 14.8).

(Locking locknut)
(9) Finally, turn the shaft by hand and make sure that it
rotates without any problems.
14.1.3 Installation of units with eccentric
locking collars
Eccentric locking collar bearings provide another option
for shaft locking. Since the rotating force of the shaft
increases the tightening force of the eccentric ring to the
shaft, this style of bearing allows a secure grip to the shaft.
Since the rotating force of the shaft increases the tighten-
ing force of the eccentric ring to the shaft, the unit with
eccentric locking collar allows secure fixing of the bearing
(Fig. 14.9).
Fig. 14.9 	Ball bearing units with eccentric
locking collar
Installation procedures for eccentric locking collar style
bearings are shown below.
(1) Inspect the unit to ensure that the rigidity of the base,
flatness of the mounting surface, and tolerance of the
shaft meet the required standards. Check the shaft for
bends, burrs, and other flaws.
(2) Slide the bearing unit onto the shaft, and place it at
the specified mounting position.
(3) Align the bearing unit to the specified position on the
base and affix it with washers, if necessary, and bolts
(Fig. 14.4). Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to
the housing to the specified torque setting. For mount-
ing bolt torque specifications, see Appendix table 2 in
the back of this catalog.
(4) Fit the eccentric section of the inner ring of the bear-
ing to the eccentric recessed section of the eccentric
locking collar, and rotate the collar in the direction of
shaft rotation. Then tighten the setscrew on the eccen-
tric locking collar to the specified torque setting (Fig.
14.10). For setscrew torque specifications, see Appen-
dix table 3 in the back of this catalog.

(5) Rotate the shaft by hand and then install the next
eccentric locking collar unit to the shaft.
(6) Finally, turn the shaft by hand and make sure that it
rotates without any problems.
14.1.4 Installing units with covers
Covers for ball bearing units are available in two types,
steel plate and cast iron. Install both the covers at last after
installation of the bearing and housing is complete.
Procedures for installation of the ball bearing units with
covers are shown below.
(1) Apply grease all around the seal lip of the cover, and
pack the internal space of the cover with grease
(approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the space capacity)
(Fig. 14.11).
Pack grease
Fig. 14.11 	Packing grease in internal space of
seal lip of covers
(2) Put a cover through the shaft, and then, fit the bear-
ing unit to the shaft.
(3) Fit the cover through the shaft to the cover groove on
the housing, and fix it.
(4A) For the steel plate cover, tap all around the cover
evenly with a synthetic resin hammer to prevent defor-
mation, and install it to the housing (Fig. 14.12).
To remove the steel plate cover, put a screwdriver
into the groove on the periphery of the cover, and
slightly pry it.
Fig. 14.12 	Installing steel plate covers
(4B) When installing the cast iron cover, fit the cover to
the cover groove of the housing, and fix it with the bolt.
For the tightening torque of the cast iron cover
mounting bolt, see the Appendix table 2 at the end of
this catalogue.
(5) Install another cover to the housing in a similar
manner.
(6) Check for abnormality of the installed cover.
(7) At last, turn the shaft with your hands, and check for
abnormality in the rotating status of the bearing.
14.2 Test run inspection
After installation of the ball bearing unit is complete,
execute the test run inspection to ensure that it is done
appropriately.
The test run inspection should be executed by following
the procedures below. Check for abnormality in the bearing
unit.
(1) Turn the shaft with your hands, and make sure that
the bearing is rotated smoothly.
If any jam, vibration, great rotation torque (heavy), or
uneven rotation is found, the bearing is judged to be
faulty.
(2) Execute power run with no load and at a low speed,
and check for abnormal noise and vibration.
(3) Carry out power run under the specified conditions,
and check for abnormal noise, vibration, and tempera-
ture increase.
Table 14.2 shows the main faults that may occur during
the test run inspection of the ball bearing unit and causes.

14.3 Periodic inspection
FYH Ball Bearing Units do not need to be inspected as
frequently as lower quality bearings. However it is good
practice to set up an inspection schedule for even these
high quality bearings.
Since a ball bearing unit cannot be disassembled for
inspection of the internal status of components, the exter-
nal appearance of the bearing must be inspected to give
tell-tale signs of the status and expected life of the bearing.
The following characteristics must be checked per the
inspection schedule that is established for a particular
application.
(1) Overall appearance
(2) Looseness of set screw of bearing inner ring or
of the mounting bolts
(3) Noise from vibration
(4) Temperature of the bearing housing or the inner ring
(5) Grease supply interval and quantity of grease injected
into the bearing (either too much or too little grease
can be detrimental to the life of the bearing)
Table 14.3 shows the main faults that are usually found
during periodic inspections and their causes.
If any fault is found in a ball bearing unit during an
inspection, then immediate action must be taken to correct
the situation and prevent deterioration of the bearing com-
ponents. If serious damage has already occurred to the
bearing unit, then the bearing unit must be replaced imme-
diately to prevent damage to other machine components.

14.4 Supply of grease
FYH ball bearing units are supplied with high quality
grease packed inside a high quality seal. Therefore, under
clean operating conditions at lighter loads and lower
speeds at normal temperatures, the bearing may be used
with no further lubrication.
However, under harsher operating conditions and envi-
ronment, the grease will deteriorate much more rapidly.
This would include environments exposed to dust, moisture
or higher operating temperatures.
In such cases, a regreasing schedule must be estab-
lished to prevent premature failure of the bearings. The life
of the bearing can be greatly extended by proper attention
to the regreasing schedule and by supplying the proper
amount of grease. Please note that too much grease can
be detrimental as well as too little grease.

-- 60 of 184 --

57
14.4.1 Grease life and supply intervals
The grease life of a packed ball bearing unit can be
found using Formula (4.7) on page 21.
The regreasing schedule should be set at 1/4 to 1/3 of
the grease life found by the calculation shown above ;
however this may be adjusted for particularly demanding
environments or conditions.
In addition, some environments may be unusually dirty or
wet, and these conditions may be exacerbated by higher
temperatures. Under such harsh conditions, a more fre-
quent regreasing schedule will extend the life of the bear-
ing.
Under normal operating conditions, please adhere to the
guidelines outlined in Table 14.4.
14.4.2 Amount of grease
The amount of grease initially supplied in a new FYH Ball
Bearing Unit is approximately 30 to 35% of the internal
space capacity of the bearing. If the bearing is ever over
greased, the agitation of the grease causes internal friction
and heating of the bearing. The first sign of failure will be
excessive grease finding its way to the outside of the
bearing. DO NOT exceed the initial greasing amount.
Table 14.5 shows the recommended amount of grease
to be used for regreasing FYH bearings.
In a severely dusty or wet environment, the amount of
grease may be increased by two times, only if operating
speeds are low.
Remarks 1. Table 14.5 applies to UK units as well.
2. For greasing triple lip (L) type bearings,
use 1 1/2 times the amount of grease rec-
ommended in the table.
3. Values shown in the table are applicable to
standard grease (specifi c gravity : 0.9 g/ml).
If a compatible grease of another specifi c
gravity is used, then the proper conversion
must be made, to insure that the recom-
mended volume is put into the bearing.

Remark Greasing intervals shown in this table are applicable to a unit operated for 8 to 10 hours per day.
If the time of operation is greater than this range, then a more frequent greasing interval must be
specifi ed. For example, if the unit is operated 16 to 20 hours per day, then the greasing interval
must be twice as frequent.

14.4.3 Types of grease supplied
Many different types of grease are available for use in
ball bearings. However, if a non-compatible grease is used,
particularly a non-lithium based grease, then performance
may be drastically reduced.
Please use the grease recommended in Table 2.3 to
assure optimum performance of your bearings.
If another grease is used in an emergency situation, for
instance, please assure that this grease is compatible, with
a lithium base, at the minimum.
14.4.4 Relubricating the unit at the specified
interval
Note Fig. 14.13 which shows the grease nipple, grease
groove and grease holes for relubrication of the unit.
Fig. 14.13 	Supplying grease to ball bearing
units
Supplying grease
(1) Clean the grease nipple and the area around it to
prevent dirt and foreign material from entering the
unit.
(2) Clean the grease gun and pack clean grease.
(3) Grease the unit with the recommended amount of
grease.
When lubricating the ball bearing unit, slowly turn the
shaft with your hand. This causes the fresh grease to be
uniformly distributed inside the unit.
If it is difficult to access the standard straight type nipple
with a grease gun, the 45º and 90º angled units are avail-
able as an option. See the picture below of these grease
nipples. Please contact us with your special needs.
Fig. 14.14 	Types of grease nipple for ball
bearing units
Type A 	Type C (90º)	Type B (67.5º)
When using a centralized automatic lubrication system,
with ball bearings, it is important to use softer grease than
normal. The grease should be specified with a "worked
penetration number" between 300 and 380. This is NLGI
grade "0" or "1". Piping from the lubricating system must be
sized so that the specified volume of grease is applied.
Piping must be connected to the threaded hole on the
ball bearing unit. This is either 1/4-28 tapered threads for
units up to "2" in size or 1/8 PT (BSPT) for ball bearing
units larger than "2" shaft diameter. If the piping size used is
larger than the threaded hole in the ball bearing unit, then
the appropriate reducing coupling (or street elbow) must be
used to fit the threaded hole.
Fig. 14.15 shows the body of a pipe reducer.
When using an automatic centralized lubrication system,
it is imperative to assure that the correct volume of grease
is supplied to each individual bearing as specified in Table
14.5. The total amount of grease is a multiple of the number
of bearings being supplied by the central system.
Fig. 14.15 	Reducing coupling for centralized
lubrication systems
For details of grease nipples and reducing couplings, see
"16 Parts and accessories".

14.5 Replacing bearings
If a bearing insert needs to be replaced, it is not always
necessary to replace the housing, if the housing is undam-
aged. Simply insert a new bearing into the old housing,
after carefully inspecting the housing to assure that it is not
damaged.
Replacement procedures for a bearing insert are listed
below.
(1) Remove the complete bearing unit from the shaft and
mounting base.
(2) Screw in the set screws so that the head of the set
screw does not protrude outside the O.D. of the inner
race. Otherwise the head of the set screw may dam-
age the bearing seat inside the housing.
(3) Turn the bearing 90º with a hammer handle or a bar
or pipe until the bearing is horizontal.
(4) Remove the bearing insert from the housing via the
bearing groove in the housing.
Reverse the above procedure to put in a new bear-
ing insert. Insure that the set screws are screwed in
before proceeding with the replacement.

Remarks 1. In Part No. of unit and units with covers, fi tting codes follow bore diameter codes. (See Table 10.5 in P.42.)
2. Part No. of applicable grease nipples is C-1/4-28UNF.
3. As for the triple seal type product (204 and 205 are the double seal type products), accessory code L3 (or L2) follows the Part No. of unit
or bearing. (Example of Part No. : UCTL206JL3-100, UC206L3)
4. The unit should be mounted so that load is applied to the frame mounting surface vertically and downward.
5. If heavy load (Pr /Cr > 0.12), vibration, or impact occurs, contact with FYH.
6. Tapered bore (with adapter) type bearing units are also available. (Example of Part No. : UKTL206J-100 + H306X, UK206 + H306X)
7. If frame parts need to be corrosion resistant, contact with FYH.
8. For the dimensions and forms of applicable bearings, see the dimensional tables of ball bearing for unit.

Remarks 1. Priority is given to the nominal sizes of screws without parentheses.
2. Nominal lengths (9) to be recommended for the nominal sizes of screw are within the range enclosed by bold lines in the column of
"Body length 9g". In the column of "Body length 9g", thread of the screw with length shorter than that indicated under dotted lines
should be continuous. For the continuous thread stud screw, the incomplete thread portion length under the neck of the screw should
be approximately three times of the thread pitch.
3. The sides of the head of screw should be single or double knurled. The dk values in the table are the maximum values without knurls.
4. Roundness or chamfers on the bearing surface should be provided between the diameter of the head (dk) and the diameter of
bearing surface (dw), and the surface should be free from burrs.
