The ACE Story
In the 1950’s industrial shock absorbers were custom designed for specific weights, velocity and propelling force 
of the moving load. If these variables were precisely known and constant over time, a fixed orifice shock absorber, 
called a “hydroshock” did the job. But most often the weight, speed and forces were usually estimates and 
designing and building a shock that would work was a trial and error process.
The founder of ACE Controls, William J. Chorkey Sr. was an engineer at MAC Valves where he was asked by Ford 
Motor Company to design circuits to decelerate air cylinders. He and Walter Ludwig, the President of MAC Valves, 
devised a valve circuit that reversed the direction of the cylinder piston cylinder before the end-of-stroke impact. 
Although this circuit was not an ideal solution, Ford benefited by increased production and less damage to air 
cylinders. Mr. Chorkey recognized that there was need for deceleration technology in order to increase production 
speeds.
Mr. Chorkey started Automation Control Equipment Company, later changed to ACE Controls, in 1963 as a 
pneumatic accessories manufacturer. Their first products were flow controls and check valves. Since Mr. Chorkey 
knew most of the MAC Valves distributors, he signed many of them up as distributors.
Lynn Nagle, of Kober Sales, Flint, MI, was the very first ACE first distributor. Lynn took Mr. Chorkey on a sales call 
at GM’s Fisher Body where they were having problems with a non-adjustable hydroshock on a bumper line. When 
Fisher Body tried to speed up production, bumpers flew off the line. Mr. Chorkey studied the hydroshock concept 
and then designed a way to adjust a shock in the field. “Adjust-A-Shock” was born and ACE was on its way.  
50 years later, ACE is well recognized as the global leader in industrial shock absorption technology with a strong 
belief in local support, available worldwide. 
ACE Controls apply deceleration and vibration dampening expertise to diverse applications that range from the

Degree of Isolation
Vibration Isolation
Noise reduction and vibration isolation are becoming more important. This applies especially to the 
workplace and to manufacturing environments.
There are many reasons for preventing noise emissions or harmful vibration including; product quality, 
protecting delicate measuring and testing equipment.
Preventive vibration isolation leads to

improved working conditions 

more accurate production tolerances and increased product quality

competitive and cost advantages due to lower reject rates

increased production speed due to increased maximum machine dynamics

longer tool and machine life

faster and more accurate measuring

Source Isolation Example
Receiver Isolation Example
Types and mode of action of vibration isolation 
Vibration isolation is generally subdivided into source isolation and receiver isolation. Source isolation, for 
example, is a press or machine that is isolated from its foundation so that the vibration is isolated.
In the case of receiver isolation, the object to be protected, e.g. a measuring table, is isolated from the 
foundation. If the machinery or equipment is rigidly connected to the foundation without isolation material, one 
can assume an almost 100% transmission of vibration or shock.
The task of vibration isolation for machinery and equipment is to reduce the transmission of mechanical 
vibrations and reciprocal forces by installing elastic, damping components.
It is not always possible to provide an elastic (soft) support for all machines, foundations, measurement 
facilities and building parts. Users must find a balance between system stability and degree of isolation. 
ACE engineers are happy to assist you in selecting products and solutions.

Effectiveness and Vibration Calibration
In order to assess the effectiveness of isolation elements for harmonic vibration, one relates the excitation frequency fe 
(machine speed in cycles per second) of the isolator to the natural frequency f0. The effectiveness of isolation increases 
with the decreasing natural frequency of the system. If the ratio ɳ of the excitation to the natural frequency of the system 
is larger than √2, one may refer to an isolation effect. Furthermore, the degree of effectiveness (isolation) increases in 
proportion to the ratio (ɳ = fe / f0).
If the ratio is lower than the limit √2, the vibration may become amplified. This is the case in the resonance range if the 
disturbance frequency is equal to that of the natural frequency of the isolator (ɳ = fe / f0 = 1).
Damping (D) plays an additional, important role in vibration isolation. When ramping up machines to their operating 
speed or when ramping down, the natural frequencies of the vibration isolation are typically transmitted. In order not to 
exceed the amplitudes or limit values when passing through the resonances, sufficient damping must be in place. 
More Complex Vibration
In case of more complex vibration, a vibration analysis is recommended. In this process, the measured 
time signal is transformed into the frequency range. The analysis of the vibration frequency will allow 
proper material selection that will result in the lowest excitation frequency being isolated.
Quick Selection 
Different products can be used to isolate machinery and 
equipment. These differ in material, form and mode of 
action. The following quick selection will allow an initial 
rough estimation by showing you the effectiveness of the 
different damping products.
Unlike uniform vibration, shocks induced by machinery, 
equipment or production processes differ in their time 
profile and intensity. Application Engineers are available 
to assist you in selecting the right shock absorber. In 
addition, selection ranges which suit your needs are 
available on www.acecontrols.com.

Critical performance area
In the area shown here in red, there is either no 
improvement or only a very minor improvement in 
the starting vibration situation. This critical performance area 
also corresponds to the area of resonance. 
Quick selection made easy! 
The majority of isolation solutions can be found with the relatively easy use of diagrams. They allow a 
simple relation to be made between natural frequency, the predominant excitation frequency and the 
degree of isolation to be expected. 
Natural frequencies of products  

in relation to the load in pounds (Ibs.) per 	

element (rubber-metal isolators) or lb/in² as  

surface pressure (damping pads).
Spring characteristic  

according to load or surface pressure.

Relationship diagram  

the relationship between the excitation  

frequency, natural frequency and desired  

isolation effect.
As marked in the diagrams, we recommend the use of 
products with a theoretical degree of isolation of 50% 
or higher. Another value for an efficient and costeffective vibration isolation is a ratio of roughly 3 
between the excitation frequency of the isolator and 
the predominant excitation frequency. 
The model on which this simplified quick selection  
is based upon is the physics of a single-degree of 
freedom system. It is recommended to contact a 
technical consultant or application engineer with more 
complex, non-rigid systems and super structures.

The selection tables were prepared according to our 
best knowledge; their use excludes entitlement to 
legal and warranty claims. On request, ACE offers 
consultation and measurement services separately to 
this approximate preselection. 
Using the diagram
Example
A user has a 2,200 lbs machine with 1,800 RPM, which 
corresponds to an excitation frequency of 1,800 / 60 = 30 
Hz. Furthermore, the user would like to achieve a good 
isolation to the floor through the use of 4 CM cup mounts 
(550 lbs per isolator). 
The resultant procedure is as follows:
Draw horizontal line in diagram 1 at 550 lbs  
Load per isolator. The line intersects 3 products 
as solutions, the first and most efficient is product 
2 in this case.
Draw horizontal line in diagram 3 at 30 Hz 
disturbance frequency.
Draw a vertical line from the intersection point in 
diagram 1 downwards until the horizontal line 
previously drawn in diagram 3 is met.
Now you can simply read the isolation to be 
anticipated: in this case it is 70%, which 
represents a good isolation value.
Continue to draw the horizontal line from diagram 
1 until it intersects the product line product 2 in 
diagram 2.  
Here the value for the static deflection can be 
read on the x-axis below. In this example, the 
reference value is 0.06 inch.

Height-adjustable machine mounts from the LEV product group are maintenance-free and ready to install. The precise, 
adjustable LEV machine mounts are used whenever machines require an adjustable, stable positioning. 
Their function ensures the secure positioning of machinery and equipment, protecting them against damaging shocks and vibrations. 
LEV machine mounts can be supplied in different sizes, from 3/8" to 1" threads, and can secure and bear loads from 30 lbs to 
13,000 lbs.
The selection of suitable machine mounts is made via the given mass of the machine distributed among the desired support points. 
Weight distribution within the system must be considered in such a way that the mounts are also measured with the associated load 
component. If additional dynamic loads are exerted by the machine, the next largest type must be chosen in a borderline static load 
case.
The mounts meet OSHA requirements for anchoring machines.

Difference between stationary and mobile application in the  
selection diagrams
Stationary applications are those in which the cup mounts isolate fixed 
machines. Mobile applications, refer to applications in which the cup 
mounts isolate electronics, rotors or other parts on moving vehicles. Their 
range of application is reduced because, in addition to static load, there 
are additional dynamic loads exerted by the movement which must be 
considered.

The COM compression mounts are high-performance equipment mounting elements for vertical 
machine applications. These robust, neoprene elastomer equipment mounts are primarily used in 
heavy-duty applications, such as pumps and compressors. 
In their operating range, COMs exhibit a low natural frequency of approximately 8 to 15 Hz and can be coupled for 
certain applications, whereby the natural system frequency can be further reduced to approximately 6 to 10 Hz 
(please refer to the selection diagram for more exact data). They are often used in situations where unbalanced 
machine parts cause shock and vibration which can have a negative impact on the surrounding area.  
Disturbance frequencies from 900 rpm (15 Hz) are effectively isolated. With excitation frequencies of  
25 Hz, the degree of isolation of the COMs is 90%. Through the use of the high-performance equipment 
mountings, structure-borne noise paths are interrupted, preventing the generation of resonant sound.

The vibration isolation mount (All-Attitude Mount) of the AAM product group are maintenancefree and ready-to-install isolators that can reduce vibration and shock in all directions. The 
isolation effect is achieved by a special neoprene-elastomer insert.
For applications in which maximum shock absorption is particularly critical, the AAMs can also be 
manufactured with high-damping silicone. The mounts can be installed in all axes. The AAM range is used 
mainly for isolating lighter electronic equipment and components.

These sturdy, fail-safe isolators of the SFM product group are maintenance-free,  
ready-to-install machine elements. Neoprene is the standard damping material for these 
extremely effective isolation mounts. 
The isolators are used in diesel generator sets and marine engines. The SFMs are available in three sizes 
for applications from 110 lbs to 2,200 lbs. Horizontal stiffness in the long direction is 2.5 times the axial 
stiffness and in the short direction it is 0.75 times the axial stiffness. Under a working load, the SFMs have 
a natural frequency of only 8 Hz.

FLs are removable, quick fastening elements for vibration isolation and shock absorption as well 
as the isolation of structure-borne noise. They are designed so that only one element can be 
used to effectively decouple two components from each other by tightening a fastening screw. 
Standard metric screws (M3 to M8) can be used to tighten the connecting elements; no additional special 
tools are required. The FL elastic fasteners can be fixed via the screw connection into blind holes to connect 
panel elements to existing structures. The inner threaded insert serves as an expansion element for 
fastening. The EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) material used is resistant to ozone, oil and most 
acids. Standard FLs are available in five sizes from M3 to M8.

Vibration-Isolation made 
to measure 
Variable, flexible, custom-cut
Vibration-isolating ACE pads are used whenever an adjusted isolation of vibration and structure-borne noise  
is required.
The correct damping solution for standard applications can found by using the selection diagrams (following pages).  
The correct material type can be identified independently of the load via the desired damping in relation to the excitation frequency.  
The ideal plate size can be quickly calculated on the basis of the load area.
A rough preselection of suitable plate materials can be made by consulting the surface pressures of different plate materials.
The SLAB and CEL pads can either be ordered in their standard size or cut according to customer request. Complete 
specifications are required for drawings.
The custom-cutting of pads allow almost any shape and solution. Various pads can be layered, bonded and combined with 
reinforcing pads (steel) or sliding layers (PTFE).
The PAD product group is made from Fiber-reinforced pad material used for very high loads of up to 2,000 PSI.

SLAB damping pads of model series SL-170 to SL-720 are universally applicable elastic Polyurethane (PUR) materials 
which are manufactured according to a patented formula and can be used for a large number of applications. 
SLAB 
Universal Damping Pads
The pads with standard sizes of 0.00614 lbs/in³ to 0.026 lbs/in³ 
serve as starting materials for the vibration isolation of different 
applications in industry and construction. The static and 
dynamic product properties are used as the basis for the 
selection of the most appropriate damping solution. 
The material determination (see selection diagram) is used to 
make the preselection of the correct damping material, after 
which, in a second, easy step, the suitable dimensions of the 
support are determined. SLABs are delivered as pre-fabricated 
standard pads or can be freely cut from the raw material (roll 
and plate material). 
Standard SLABs are supplied in material thickness of 0.5 inch 
and 1 inch. On request, the sizes of delivered pads can be cut 
freely from the standard 31.5 inch x 59 inch stock. Sample 
pads with dimensions 8.7 inch x 5.9 inch and the respective 
thicknesses are available for test purposes and small 
applications, with maximum machinable dimensions up to  
197 inch x 59 inch.

CEL damping pads are produced from a special nitrile rubber which dampens at 
low frequencies. 
The damping pads can be custom-cut and bonded together to achieve the proper thickness 
based on the application and isolation requirement. The tried-and-tested CEL damping pads 
are used in the field of machine and plant engineering. Here the pads isolate the floor or 
foundation to the plant or machine. Damaging vibrations are reduced, increasing production 
and or measuring quality.

The PAD Fiber and Elastomer Pads combine the positive properties of isolating elastomer 
damping with the reinforcing effect of fiber inlays. 
The PADs are sturdy damping pads for use in heavy-duty applications, e.g. under crane runways, in steel 
construction, pipeline construction and the coal, iron and steel industries. Due to their physical properties, 
the PAD pads provide outstanding damping against shock and impact as well as isolate vibrations and 
structure-borne noise.
Depending on the shape and selected dimensions, PADs can withstand compressive loads of up to  
10,000 PSI. Typically the maximum surface pressure is 2,000 PSI.

Due to the layered structure, the material exhibits excellent compressibility.  
This allows deflection to be reached without material flow (custom-fit installation 
to specific dimensions is possible). The material properties are also apparent in 
the creep behavior under load. For example, under continuous static load, the 
material only exhibits a creep tendency of approximately 5% of original 
thickness. 
Depending on the application, the PADs can be custom cut to meet customer 
specifications and/or be used as supports, washers and bushings with an 
isolating/damping effect.
Selection and calculation 
As with a conventional shock absorption application, the selection 
of a suitable material is based on the consideration of the kinetic 
energy in the system in relation to the desired damping value. The 
hysteresis curve for the material is then taken as the basis for 
selecting the correct material dimensions. 
To measure the Kinetic Energy (KE), shock absorber calculation 
software is available at www.acecontrols.com free of charge. You 
can enter your values and obtain a suitable KE result.
Our in-house and field teams are available to assist you.
Note
PADs consist of organic material subject to batch-based variations
PADs meet the following military specifications: MIL-C-882 and MIL-E-5272A.
The PADs are resistant to most oils, water vapor, water, mold and brine.  
Operating temperature range is between -65 °F and 200 °F.
The hardness of PADs is 90 ±5 shore A.
The standard pads are available in different thicknesses, graduated between 
1/16" and 1". Other thicknesses are available by combining and bonding the 
standard thicknesses. 
A combination with steel or PTFE pads is also available upon request.

Overview


For vibration control applications, the pneumatic 
(pressurized) portion of these Pneumatic Leveling 
Mounts provide significant reduction of vibration 
amplitudes occurring at frequencies above 5 Hz, 
having a natural frequency as low as 3 Hz.

Measuring tables

Test benches

Production plants
PLM pneumatic leveling mounts provide low frequency vibration and shock control for surface pads, coordinate 
fans, air compressors, motor/generator sets, high speed punch presses and more.
The PLM series pneumatic isolation mounts are low frequency vibration and shock isolators that provide both 
attenuation of vibration and equipment leveling.
PLM 
Pneumatic Leveling Mounts 
PLM pneumatic leveling mounts will also continue to isolate with no pressure 
having a vertical natural frequency of approximately 10 Hz, isolating 
frequencies above 14 Hz. The vertical to horizontal natural frequency ratio is 
approximately 1:1 with a high degree of horizontal stability.
For shock or impact applications, the outer elastomeric wall construction 
provides a high deflection shock mount. A low natural frequency (3 Hz) can be 
maintained by utilizing an external spacer to prevent a “bottom out” condition.
The PLM design features includes a molded threaded insert which allows the 
mounts to be inflated via either the standard tank valve or a pneumatic fitting. 
No custom adapters are necessary.
Supplied with a tank valve, the isolators are inflated and leveled manually 
using a hand pump or air chuck connected to an air supply. When supplied 
with a fitting, the Pneumatic Leveling Mounts can be plumbed to a dedicated, 
regulated air supply making pressurizing and leveling easier. A regulator 
control panel (right) can be supplied to regulate the pressure and height of the 
interconnected air spring elements when leveling valves are not used.
The PLM pneumatic leveling mounts can also be supplied with automatic 
leveling valves for height control. Each master isolator incorporates a leveling

Note
When installing be sure to apply a load on the PLM 
Pneumatic Leveling Mounts before they are filled 
with operating pressure (max. 72 PSI for sizes 1  
and 3) max. 87 PSI for the remaining sizes using the 
valve.

valve, which is the load sensing and height controlling element. Multiple 
support isolators may be added to support the total weight of the equipment. 
Selection and calculation 
The optimum isolation values can be achieved with PLM mounts when the 
maximum load of the individual Pneumatic Leveling Mounts are utilized to the 
fullest extent.
In standard applications, it is sufficient to select PLM mounts on the basis of 
the weight of the machine or plant to be isolated. If the maximum isolation 
effect is to be realized, additional weights (e.g. steel or granite pads) may 
have to be added to achieve the maximum permitted load range and thus the 
ideal isolation effect.
Our technicians are available to assist you in the selection 
process and provide any necessary support.

PAL 
Pneumatic Isolators with  
Automatic Level Control
The PAL type of Pneumatic Isolators provide superior low frequency isolation 
for metrology instruments, electron microscopes, MRI units, coordinate 
measuring machines and precision manufacturing equipment. 
PAL pneumatic vibration isolation systems use level controlled air springs. These 
isolators are ideally suited for conditions where height control and vibration control 
must co-exist. PAL isolators meet the critical needs of metrology instruments, electron 
microscopes, inspection stations and precision manufacturing equipment.
The standard PAL isolators have a natural frequency as low as 1.7 Hz, however, 
lower natural frequencies (0.5 Hz) can be obtained from custom designed isolators.

PAL – Pneumatic Isolators with Automatic Level Control
59


September 2016 – Product images in this catalog are marked in color for visual purposes only. Images do not necessarily represent the actual product.
A complete PAL system consists of a minimum of three 
master isolators for 3-point determinate leveling. Each 
isolator incorporates a leveling valve which is the load 
sensing and height controlling element. Any number of 
support isolators may be added to support the total 
weight of the equipment.
Systems are supplied with a control panel, automatic 
height control valves, tubing and all other pneumatic 
accessories necessary for complete system installation.
PAL isolators react quickly to changes in the supported 
load and to center of gravity shifts by automatically 
releveling to a preset position. 
A pneumatic isolation system’s performance is a 
compromise between natural frequency (isolation), valve 
leveling accuracy and settling time. 
Settling time can be defined as the time it takes for an 
isolation system’s motion to return to a predetermined 
reference with respect to a defined input disturbance. 
The disturbance can be an environmental input or 
machine induced, such as a gantry or stage movement.
Settling time is minimal with optimum damping and corresponding valve 
flow. Long settling times using pneumatic isolators are unacceptable 
because precision measuring and positioning machines can suffer 
repeatability errors and throughput losses.
ACE offers many leveling valve options depending on the application. 
Valve flow rate, stiffness and accuracy characteristics are key variables 
in the design of an acceptable solution. Leveling accuracies of +/- 
0.006" (0.15 mm) or +/- 0.001" (0.025 mm) are available. The flow rate 
and stiffness of a valve are chosen based on the pneumatic isolator 
design and damping.
Extremely low frequency calibrated 
precision isolators for use in highresolution measuring and testing 
systems.
