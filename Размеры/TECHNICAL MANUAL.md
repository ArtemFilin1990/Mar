optibelt OMEGA and optibelt ZR timing belts have been 
developed for the use in high performance drives. Drive 
speed is transmitted synchronously, i.e. without speed 
loss, and with a constant transmission ratio. 
The optibelt OMEGA tooth profile significantly reduces 
the running noise level. The teeth are designed to ensure 
that they mesh perfectly, with minimal friction, into the 
pulley teeth. optibelt OMEGA timing belts run in HTD 
and RPP pulleys.  
This technical manual contains all important information 
for the belts usage. Furthermore, the calculation methods 
for the drive design with optibelt OMEGA, optibelt 
­OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER, optibelt 
OMEGA HL and ZR timing belts are also presented.
The belt characteristics described may change due to 
various influences. Thus, the drives must be designed 
based on their intended use (or in a way that comes close 
to their intended use).
If you have any further questions, please make use of 
the free service offered by our Application Engineering 
Department.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
TIMINg bELTs IN optibelt OMEgA PROFILE
optibelt OMEgA
the optibelt OmEGA timing belt has the performance level of the established 
optibelt HtD timing belt and is its replacement. the belt is best for medium 
performance drives in all speed ranges without heavy shock loading.
Double-sided timing belts for drives with reversible speed can be delivered 
with HTD profi les.
Double-sided timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profi les on request.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA page 54-58.
optibelt OMEGA Profi le
The optibelt OMEGA profi le is a further development of the optibelt HTD profi le. Its advantage, compared to the other 
timing belt profi les, is reduced running noise.
optibelt ZRs
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER and optibelt OMEGA HL timing belts are used in 
optibelt zrS HtD timing belt pulleys or in rPP timing belt pulleys. 
For applications in other pulleys, please contact the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
optibelt OMEgA HL
On high and low speed drives the optibelt OmEGA HL timing belt exceeds 
the performance of the optibelt OmEGA HP by up to 15 %. It was also 
specially designed for shock loaded drives.
In new drives for these applications, the OmEGA HL achieves supreme 
operational reliability combined with optimum economic effi ciency.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA HL pages 46-47.
optibelt OMEgA FAN POwER
The optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER timing belt was developed for fan drives 
in the oil industry.
The optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER is characterised by a long service life and 
antistatic properties.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER pages 48-49.
optibelt OMEgA HP
the optibelt OmEGA HP timing belt reaches a performance level up to 
150 % higher than that of optibelt OmEGA and is especially applicable for 
cost-effi cient new designs.
the optibelt OmEGA HP is suitable for both low speed and high speed 
drives with high power and steady loads.
For power ratings see optibelt OMEGA HP pages 50-53.

All optibelt optibelt OMEGA timing belts have inherent 
resistance to oil, heat, cold, ozone and tropical conditions. 
Special labelling is not required.
Oil resistance
The limited oil resistance prevents the damaging effects of 
mineral oils and greases, as long as these substances are 
not in permanent contact with the timing belt and/or are not 
present in large quantities. With increased demands for 
resistance, e.g. to mineral oils, the performance of the 
optibelt OMEGA timing belts can be improved by using 
special belt constructions. Please contact the optibelt 
Application Engineering Department.
Temperature resistance
The timing belt can withstand ambient temperatures 
from ≈ –30 °C to +100 °C. Temperatures outside this range 
lead to premature ageing and embrittlement of the timing 
belts and thus to their premature failure. The temperature 
resistance of optibelt OMEGA timing belts can be extended 
using special belt constructions, e.g. up to +140 °C. Please 
contact the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
Antistatic properties
Antistatic properties enable the safe discharge of electrostatic charges. This charging can have such a strong impact 
on timing belts with insufficient electrical conductivity that 
there is the danger of ignition due to sparks. The use of 
antistatic timing belts requires that the properties be checked 
in accordance with ISO 9563, and is confirmed by the issue 
of an inspection certificate. optibelt OMEGA HP and 
optibelt OMEGA HL timing belts in profiles 8M and 14M as 
well as optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER are antistatic 
according to ISO 9563 by standard and are thus labelled 
accordingly.
Noise emission
The optimized tooth shape and the indent in the tooth tip of 
the optibelt OMEGA promote a significantly lower noise 
level. In combination with the newly developed materials, 
the noise level is further reduced, even at high speeds and 
with high belt tensions. 
Operational life
Belt designs with increased capacity can exceed the 
potential operational life of standard designs many times 
over, particularly for highly loaded or overloaded drives. 
Example: Dynamic tests with optibelt OMEGA HP show that 
the running times, compared to standard timing belts, are 
up to 18 times higher.
Efficiency
The specially developed tooth fabric and the flexible belt 
design make possible a virtually frictionless drive with an 
efficiency of up to 98 %.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
optibelt OMEgA HL TIMINg bELTs
structure
top layer
tension cord
tooth
Top layer
the top layer of the optibelt OmEGA HL as well as the the 
teeth, consists of a polychloroprene compound reinforced 
with aramid fi bres. Thus, an even more abrasion resistant 
surface is in contact with any reverse bend idler. the belt 
top layer protects the tension cord from environmental 
infl uences.
In contrast to the optibelt OmEGA HP with glass cord, the 
optibelt OMEGA HL uses a signifi cantly higher strength glass 
cord. thus, the power can be further increased by up to 
25 %. The resistance to shock leads is also signifi cantly 
increased.
Teeth
the considerably increased tooth strength (compared to 
optibelt OmEGA) is made possible by the use of aramid 
fi bres in the polychloroprene compound. This imparts very 
high tooth stiffness as well as increased shear strength.
the shear strength of the teeth is enhanced by an extremely 
tough fabric. the shape of the optibelt OmEGA teeth and 
the minimal friction fabric enable a smooth meshing of the 
belt tooth into the pulley groove. In addition, the special 
polyamide fabric is very wear resistant.
The new high performance timing belt for 
extremely high loads across the whole speed 
spectrum
Optibelt has developed this belt in the sections 8m and 
14m especially for drives with high torques and severe 
shock loads. these types of drives can often be found in 
general engineering.
For this use, the structure and the material of the timing belt 
have been optimised in such a way that highest operational 
reliability combined with optimal economic effi ciency can 
be achieved when re-designing a drive. Initially, the belt will 
be available in the 8m section. optibelt OmEGA HL timing 
belts are used in optibelt zrS HtD pulleys or in rPP timing 
belt pulleys. For applications in other pulleys, please contact 
the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
A reinforced glass tension cord is used. this innovative glass 
cord stands out due to the combination of the following, 
important characteristics:
• good resistance to shock loads
• very high dynamic resistance
• very low permanent and elastic stretch
therefore, the belt performance can be increased by an 
additional 15 %, compared to optibelt OmEGA HP. In 
contrast to an aramid cord, which also has a very high 
resistance to shock loading, the reinforced glass cord has a 
considerably lower permanent stretch during the running 
time. Aramid cord has a high permanent stretch (see 
diagram) during running. the minimal tension loss of the 
reinforced glass cord enables a keeping of the pitch and 
thus to a load which is distributed more evenly on the teeth 
during running. 
In addition, the reinforced glass cord can also be used at 
medium and high speeds while the use of the aramid cord is 
limited to low and medium speeds. In contrast to the aramid 
cord, the reinforced glass cord enables a considerable 
extension to the range of applications.

optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER TIMING BELTS
The high performance timing belt for fan drives in 
the oil industry 
Fan drives in the oil industry with medium and high transmission ratios are expected to meet some demanding requirements:
•  antistatic according to ISO 9563
•  optimised for low tooth meshing wear
•  long service life
•  maintenance-free
•  high level of efficiency
•  constant flow of air thanks to synchronous operation
•  resistant to external influences such as variations in 
temperature and moisture
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP, optibelt OMEGA HL 
and optibelt OMEGA FAN POWER timing belts are used in 
optibelt ZRS HTD timing belt pulleys or in optibelt ZRS RPP 
timing belt pulleys. For applications in other pulleys, please 
consult the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.
Structure
Top layer
Tooth
Top layer
A durable and flexible top layer protects the main body of 
the belt. The polychloroprene top surface is reinforced with 
aramid fibres with a degree of resistance to mineral oils and 
humidity, as well as protection against wear and tear due to 
friction.
The tension cords are reinforced pairs of counter twisted 
glass fibres. These tension cords have very high tensile 
strength, very high flexibility and minimal stretch.
Teeth
The teeth consist of a new compound reinforced with aramid 
fibres, which guarantee high shear strength. They are 
shaped and exactly spaced in such a way that they mesh 
perfectly with the pulley grooves with minimal friction. The 
dimple in the tooth guarantees quiet running.
The specially developed polyamide fabric stands out due to 
its extraordinarily low frictional coefficient and its low noise 
characteristics.
It also protects the teeth from early wear and tear and 
prevents tooth shear.

Top layer
A durable and flexible top layer protects the tension cord 
from external influences. In addition, the polychloroprene 
compound is reinforced with aramid fibres and has a degree 
of resistance to mineral oils and humidity as well as protection 
from wear and tear due to friction.
The tension cords are reinforced pairs of counter twisted 
glass fibres. These tension cords have very high tensile 
strength, very high flexibility and minimal stretch.
Teeth
The teeth consist of a new compound reinforced with aramid 
fibres, which guarantee high shear strength. They are 
shaped and exactly spaced in such a way that they mesh 
perfectly with the pulley teeth with minimal friction. The 
indent in the tooth guarantees quiet running.
The specially developed polyamide fabric stands out due to 
its extraordinarily low frictional coefficient and its low noise 
characteristics.
It also protects the teeth from early wear and tear and 
prevents tooth shear.
optibelt OMEGA HP TIMING BELTS
Structure 
The high performance timing belt for high load, 
high speed machine drives
Compact synchronous drives are used in the whole field of 
mechanical drive engineering. High power transmission 
capability, good running characteristics and high operational safety are only some of the demands made on timing 
belts. Modern manufacturing techniques and quality 
inspections during all processing stages ensure products 
with highest reliability. optibelt OMEGA HP high performance timing belts have been especially developed for high 
load, low and high speed drives that are evenly loaded 
without heavy shock. Improved materials and optimised 
production form the basis for this very high performance 
range.
optibelt OMEGA, optibelt OMEGA HP and optibelt 
­OMEGA HL timing belts are used in optibelt ZRS HTD timing 
belt pulleys or in optibelt ZRS RPP timing belt pulleys. 
For applications using other pulleys, please contact the 
Optibelt Application Engineering Department.

The new high performance timing belt  
optibelt OMEGA 5M HP
In the field of the high performance timing belts the optibelt 
OMEGA 5M HP has been developed for small pulley 
diameters, short centre distances and high speeds.
The optibelt OMEGA 5M HP transmits up to 3 times the 
power of an optibelt OMEGA 5M (an increase in power  
of up to 200 %). The performance level of the optibelt 
OMEGA 5M HP roughly corresponds with the level of the 
considerably larger section optibelt OMEGA 8M – with the 
same pulley diameters.

PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
optibelt OMEgA TIMINg bELTs
structure 
Application example: lawn mowers
Top layer
The belt top layer consists of a fl exible polychloroprene 
compound which protects the tension cord from external 
infl uences. In addition, it offers limited resistance to mineral 
oils and humidity as well as protection from frictional wear 
and tear.
the tension member is composed of a pair of counter 
twisted glass fi bre cords. These tension cords have high 
tensile strength, very high fl exibility and very low stretch.
Teeth
Just like the belt top layer, the teeth consist of a polychloroprene compound guaranteeing high shear strength. 
the dimples in the teeth promote quiet running.
Overview of the advantages and characteristics
• synchronous speed
• highest precision
• perceptibly lower noise level due to the optibelt OMEGA tooth profi le
• use in standard HTD and RPP timing belt pulleys
• maintenance-free
• temperature resistant from –30 °C to +100 °C
• effi ciency of up to 98 %
top layer
tension cord
tooth
the polyamide fabric protects the teeth from premature wear 
and tooth root cracking. At the same time, the low coeffi -
cient of friction lowers the operating temperature and helps 
to reduce the running noise.
High performance optibelt OmEGA timing belts are the 
result of a continuing development process. Operational 
experience with optibelt zr and optibelt HtD has been 
applied to this belt generation. Endless optibelt OmEGA 
timing belts set the standard for synchronous performance 
and for positioning drives.
The geometry of the optibelt OMEGA tooth profi le has been 
developed  to run in the established, curvilinear timing belt 
pulleys. optibelt OmEGA timing belts can be used in 3m, 
5M, 8M and 14M HTD pulley profi les. optibelt ZRS HTD 
timing belt pulleys are standard items in our range with pilot 
bores or bored for optibelt tB taper bushes. In addition, all 
OmEGA timing belts can also be used in rPP timing belt 
pulleys. Special timing belt pulleys for optibelt OmEGA 
timing belts are not required.

structure 
In order to obtain a low level of wear on the running 
surfaces as well as achieving a high level of tooth shear 
strength, a tough, wear resistant fabric is applied to the 
outer tooth surface.
Tooth pitch, designations
optibelt zr timing belts are manufactured according to 
ISO 5296, timing belt pulleys according to ISO 5294. 
Both come in six standard profi les.
Due to the American origin of the timing belt profi le, the 
length unit is “in” for inch. the width/length codes have thus 
been derived from the imperial (inch) measurements of 
widths and lengths.

Belt layer
tension cord
tooth
Top layer
A fl exible belt backing embeds the tension element and 
supports it against the reverse idlers. the top layer consists 
of a fl exible high quality chloroprene compound. This 
protects the tension cord from oil, humidity, friction and 
wear and tear.
this top layer has some inherent resistance to mineral oils, 
but not to vegetable oils and water soluble cooling and 
cutting oils.
The tension cord is a continuous, spirally wound glass fi bre. 
this material has a high tensile strength and is extremely 
fl exible. The low-stretch properties of the tension cord ensure 
that the pitch of the belt corresponds to the pitch of the 
pulley – even when under strain.
Teeth
the teeth are made of a shear and wear resistant rubber 
compound vulcanised to form a unit with the belt back. the 
shape and arrangement of the teeth are such that the pulley 
engages the belt teeth precisely and with minimum friction. 
As long as six teeth or more are in mesh on the small pulley, 
the complete capacity of the timing belt can be used without 
any deduction.
tooth pitch is the distance from the centre of one tooth to the 
centre of the next measured at the pitch line, which corresponds with the level of the tension cord. the pitch or datum 
diameter of the pulley is a theoretical dimension which lies 
outside the outer diameter.

Further special constructions
optibelt ZR timing belts with reinforced top 
surfaces
If the timing belt is to be used for the conveyance of various 
goods, we recommend using optibelt zr timing belts with 
reinforced top surfaces.
Please give the required overall thickness (hs) of the belt 
when ordering.
optibelt ZR timing belts with ground top surfaces
When using back bend idlers, especially when dealing with 
high belt speeds and vibration, we recommend optibelt zr 
timing belts with ground top surfaces. Available grinding 
tolerances are given in the following table 4:
PRODUCT DEsCRIPTION
sTANDARD PROPERTIEs / sPECIAL DEsIgNs
optibelt ZR timing belts with angled sides
optibelt zr timing belts with angled sides can be customised 
for special applications.
Special lengths, widths, tooth pitch or open-ended versions 
of optibelt zr timing belts and the minimum order quantities 
are available on request.
All optibelt zr timing belts are oil-, heat- and cold-resistant 
as standard. Special labelling is not required.
Oil resistance
the inherent oil resistance prevents the damaging effects of 
mineral oils and greases, as long as these substances are 
not in permanent contact with the timing belt and / or are 
not present in large quantities With increased demands for 
resistance, e.g. to mineral oils, the performance of the 
optibelt zr timing belts can be improved by using special 
constructions. Please contact the optibelt Application 
Engineering Department for more details.
Temperature resistance
the timing belt can withstand ambient temperatures from 
≈ –30 °C to +100 °C. Temperatures outside this range lead 
to premature ageing and embrittlement of the timing belts 
and thus to their premature failure. the temperature resistance of Optibelt zr timing belts can be extended using 
special constructions, e.g. up to +140 °C. Please contact the 
Optibelt Application Engineering Department for more 
details.
Anti-static properties
Anti-static properties enable the safe discharge of electrostatic charges. this charging can have such a strong impact 
on timing belts with insuffi cient electrical conductivity that 
there is the danger of ignition due to sparks. the use of 
anti-static timing belts requires that the properties be 
checked in accordance with ISO 9563 and is confi rmed by 
the issue of an inspection certifi cate.

Possible combinations
optibelt zr timing belts with standard or special compounds 
can be combined with other special designs. However, the 
individual properties of the special compounds cannot be 
combined with each other. For example, the properties of 
an extra heat-resistant belt cannot be combined with those 
of an antistatic belt.

LOAD FACTORS
Total load factor c2
The total load factor c2 is comprised of the basic load factor 
c0 plus two further loads c3 and c6.
Basic load factor c0
The basic load factor c0 takes into account the daily operating time, the type of drive and the prime mover. As it is 
almost impossible to put all the possible combinations of 
prime mover / driven unit / environmental conditions in a 
shortened form which conforms to standards, the service 
factors shown here are given only as a guideline. The 
classification of the work machine is dependent on the 
respective present load type.
c2 = c0 + c3 + c6
c2 ≥ MA/MN  recommended for frequent starts and stops

Additional Factors
Table 7
Fatigue correction factor c6
Speed correction factor c3
For speed increasing drives, a factor corresponding to the 
speed ratio is added to the basic load factor c0.
With frequent starts and stops or continual reversing operation, the selected total load factor c2 
should be higher than the ratio between starting 
torque and nominal torque. If there is a brake on 
the prime mover the same procedure should 
apply for the braking torque, if the brake is used 
frequently. For further questions, please contact 
the Optibelt Application Engineering Department.

bELT TENsION
belt tension for optibelt OMEgA HP/optibelt 
OMEgA HL and optibelt OMEgA timing belts
For proper power transmission and for achieving an 
acceptable belt service life, the correct belt tension is of  
the utmost importance.
too low or too high belt tension will lead to the premature 
failure of the timing belts. Over tensioning often leads to 
bearing failure on the prime mover or the driven machine. 
Experience shows that unscientifi c belt tensioning methods, 
such as the “thumb pressure method”, are not suitable for 
applying the optimum tension to the drive for maximum 
effi ciency and drive/bearing life. It is therefore recommended that the correct static belt tension should be calculated 
for each drive. Due to their extremely low-stretch characteristics Optibelt timing belts do not require any further tensioning after correct installation, if properly used.

DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES
TIMING BELTS in optibelt OMEGA Profile
Timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profiles are produced in 
a wide range of lengths and widths. Many special lengths, 
widths and designs are available. Please contact our 
Application Engineering Department for further details.
Timing belts with optibelt OMEGA profiles are produced to 
ground category G2 with a thickness tolerance of ± 0.25 mm 
as standard. If required, the belts can be ground to category 
G1 with a thickness tolerance of ± 0.13 mm.

DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES
Balancing
Processed steel pulleys need no balancing if the rim speed 
is below 30 m/s. Grey cast iron pulleys for medium speeds 
should be statically balanced according to the following 
table:
Parallelism
The teeth should run parallel to the axis of the bore with a 
tolerance of not more than 0.001 mm per millimetre width.
Conicity
The conicity may not exceed 0.001 mm per millimetre of  
the width of the driving face and at the same time should 
not exceed the permitted outside diameter tolerances.
Pulleys running at rim speeds exceeding of 30 m/s require 
dynamic balancing up to 1.8  · 10-5 Nm.

FLANgED PULLEYs / TENsION IDLERs
Maximum timing belt width
the maximum timing belt width should not exceed the pitch 
diameter of the smallest pulley in the drive.
Tension idlers
Idlers are grooved or fl at faced pulleys that do not transmit 
power within the drive system. Because they create additional bending stresses within the belt, their use should be 
used according to the following guidelines:
•  Diameter of the tension idler ≥ according to the smallest 
recommended pulley diameter for the profi le
•  Width of the idler ≥ widths of the timing belt pulleys in 
the drive
• Always install idlers in the slack side of the drive
•  Inside idlers:
≤ 40 teeth always use a timing belt pulley
> 40 teeth a fl at belt pulley can be used
•  In general, outside idlers should always be fl at faced as 
they run on the top surface of the belt
• Crowned idlers should never be used
•  Fit the tension idlers in such a way as to enable as many 
teeth as possible to mesh with the small pulley
•  Keep the arc of contact on the tension idler as small as 
Flanged pulleys
The pulleys may be fi tted with fl anges on one or both sides 
to assist the smooth running of the timing belt.
If the drive centre distance is ≥ 8 dwk one pulley should be 
equipped with fl anges on both sides.
We recommend the use of standard pulleys. If this is not 
possible due to design reasons, special pulleys may be 
employed.

safety hints
Drives which are correctly designed according to geometric 
and performance aspects using Optibelt timing belts ensure 
a high level of operational safety and optimum belt life. 
It has been proved in practice that unsatisfactory service life 
is frequently due to installation and maintenance errors. 
We recommend that the following precautions be taken:
• Timing belt pulleys

the teeth should be clean and comply with standard 
specifi cations.
• Alignment

All shafts and pulleys should be aligned before belt 
installation.

maximum deviation in shaft parallel alignment:

± 1°
> 25 ≤   50
± 0.5°
> 50 ≤ 100
± 0.25°
> 100
± 0.15°
• Timing belt sets

timing belts which run in pairs or in multiples on the one 
drive system must always be ordered as sets. this way it 
is guaranteed that all belts are cut from the same production sleeve and have an identical length.
• Installation

Before installation, the drive centre distance should be 
reduced to enable the timing belts to be fi tted with 
absolutely no force. If this is not possible the timing belts 
must be fi tted together with one or both of the pulleys. 
Any use of force during the fi tting of the belt will result in 
damage to the high quality low-stretch tension cord and 
other components; this damage may not be immediately 
apparent. 

In case taper bushes are used, the studs should be 
checked after 0.5 to 1 hour via torque wrench. tightening torque values see page 91.
• Tensioning

tensioning should be carried out in accordance with the 
guidelines on page 44. Once fi tted, no further checking 
or adjustment is necessary.
• Idlers

Idlers should be avoided. If this is not possible, please 
follow our recommendations on page 112 of this manual.
• Maintenance

Optibelt timing belts require virtually no maintenance if 
they are used under normal environmental conditions.

Drive design
the protective covering on both tooth faces and the resultant 
identical power transmission capability of both sides of the 
belt, allow for an unlimited distribution of the power to be 
transmitted. the maximum allowed nominal power rating 
can be transmitted from either the inner or the outer tooth 
face. With several driven pulleys the power can be distributed in any combination through both sides of the belt. 
the total power transmitted cannot, however, exceed the 
maximum permitted levels.
Example:
structure 
As standard belts, the tension cord consists of continuous, 
spirally wound glass fi bre. This material ensures high tensile 
strength with the minimum stretch. Exceptional fl exibility is 
achieved by embedding the cord in the centre.
Teeth
the teeth are arranged directly opposite each other and are 
manufactured from a medium hard, shear- and wear-resistant rubber compound. they mesh exactly with the tooth 
groove of the pulley with minimum resistance. As long as six 
teeth or more are in mesh, the capacity of the belt is used 
optimally.
Fabric cover
Both sides of the teeth are covered with a tough, friction 
resistant fabric. This fabric with its low coeffi cient of friction 
is therefore characterised by a long operational life.
the design must be based on the nominal power values for 
standard belts (see pages 60 to 71). All available sizes on 
pages 32 to 34.

Applications
Optibelt SK wedge belts with the sections SPZ, SPA, SPB and SPC
were specially developed for all industrial applications from lightly
loaded drives, such as those for pumps, to heavily loaded stone
crusher drives.
Standards
Optibelt SK wedge belts SPZ, SPA, SPB and SPC conform to BS
3790, DIN 7753 Part 1 and ISO 4184.
British, German and ISO standards specify the datum width as a
basis for the standardisation of V-belts and grooves. This is the
width of a V-belt that remains unchanged when the belt is bent
perpendicular to the base of its cross section. The datum length Ld
of the belt is the length measured at the position of the datum width
and is the basis of standardisation.
Optibelt offer a more comprehensive range of belt sections and
lengths than those included in any individual standard.
Construction
Optibelt SK wedge belts consist of
The base and filler rubbers are extruded to precise profile dimensions and weight per unit length to give a better fit in the pulley
grooves and vibration free running.
Polyester tension cord is standard, with yarn constructions matched
to section. The cord is specially impregnated and then encapsulated in a special rubber compound to give a perfect bond to the base
and filler rubber. In addition the cord is pre-stretched prior to
building into the belt to give lower stretch characteristics on the
drive. As a result, we were able to reduce significantly our
recommended minimum allowances for drive centre adjustment,
compared to those specified in BS/DIN/ISO.
The fabric cover is treated with a wear resistant rubber compound.
This renders the belt resistant to oil, heat and cold and to the effects
of dust.
Properties
Optibelt SK wedge belts are the result of intensive product and
material development. The use of the best materials and the most
advanced production methods, backed up by the most modern
static and dynamic test equipment ensures that the finished product
is a most efficient method of transmitting power
Optibelt SK wedge belts differ from classical V-belts as follows:
G Considerable reduction in cross sectional area for similar power
transmission capability (belt width to height ratio approx.
1:1.2). This allows substantial savings in pulley face widths and
therefore costs.
G Lower comparative belt weight per unit length and consequently
lower centrifugal force permits belt speeds of up to 42 m/sec.
G Greater flexibility permits higher flexing rates (fB max = 100 per
sec.).
G Greater surface area relative to belt section ensures better heat
dissipation.
G Less deformation of the belt cross section when in contact with
the pulley therefore better contact between the belt edges and
the pulley grooves.
All these properties result in a performance significantly higher
than that of classical V-belts with approximately the same top
widths. Therefore Optibelt SK wedge belts should be used on all
new drive designs.

optibelt SK Wedge Belts to USA Standard RMA/MPTA
Construction/Properties
Optibelt SK wedge belts to USA Standard RMA/MPTA have the
same construction and properties as wedge belts to BS 3790 and
DIN 7753 Part 1.
Standardisation/Dimensions
The three wedge belt sections standardised in the USA are 3V/9N,
5V/15N and 8V/25N. The cross section dimensions of these belts
and the lengths by which they are identified are not in accordance
with BS 3790 or DIN 7753.
The section 3V/9N roughly corresponds to SPZ; and 5V/15N to
the section SPB. There is no comparable BS/DIN/ISO wedge belt
section for 8V/25N. It is possible to use belts of 3V/9N and 5V/
15N section in SPZ-Z/10 or SPB-B/17 pulleys, respectively; but the
use of SPZ or SPB belts in RMA/MPTA standard pulleys is not
normally recommended. The top width of the American pulley
grooves are narrower than those of the corresponding BS/DIN/
ISO pulleys. This can cause wear on the upper edges of SPZ and
SPB section belts and can lead to premature failure.
Optibelt SK wedge belts in SPB section have been so
designed that they are also suitable for use with 5V/
15N pulleys.

Applications
The use of Optibelt SK wedge belt drives in sections 3V/9N and
5V/15N is recommended for machines exported to countries such
as the USA and Canada where these belt sections are standardised
and used predominantly.
Section 8V/25N is primarily employed in very heavy duty drives
such as mills or stone crushers. As these wedge belts transmit very
high levels of power, they can sometimes form a more compact
drive than the SPC section.
For this reason, the 8V/25N section has continued to be used in
Europe for such applications. A further advantage is the fact that
single wedge belts can be replaced by Kraftbands, without
changing the pulley geometry, should unexpected belt vibration
problems develop.
Drive Calculation
Drive calculations follow procedures described in this manual.
Power ratings for 3V/9N and 5V/15N sections are the same as
those for SPZ and SPB sections respectively but, for 3V/9N and
5V/15N the pulley outside diameter is the basis for calculation, not
the pitch or datum diameter. Slight differences in the theoretical
drive speed and the speed ratio are not significant in practice.

optibelt RED POWER II High Performance Wedge Belts
Construction
Optibelt Red Power II wedge belts.
The tension cord for all sections and cross sections consists of a
special polyester cord. Due to the special treatment of the tension
cord the Optibelt Red Power II wedge belt is very low stretch and
service free, so that retensioning is not necessary.
The fibre mixture over and under the tension cord guarantees
highly dynamic load of the belt and provides good flexibility in
combination with the polyester tension cord.
The cover fabric is extremely wear resistant, flexible and abrasion
proof.
Properties
The high-quality components in connection with product manufacturing make the Optibelt Red Power II a service free V-belt.
Production is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art static
and dynamic testing devices.
Application with drives using idler pulleys is possible due to the
special set-up of the Optibelt Red Power II.
Its properties:
G service free
G strong power rating
G favourable cost
G SetConstant
G environmentally friendly
Optibelt Red Power II are oil-resistant, heat-resistant and dust
protected as standard.
Using the electrically conductive Optibelt Red Power II requires
testing the stipulated properties according to ISO 1813. With our
acceptance test certificate according to EN 10204 “3.1.B” we
prove its anti-static properties.
V-belt tensioning
For the initial fitting of Optibelt Red Power II the same calculation
methods are used as for standard Optibelt V-belts. The tensioning
values are to be calculated on the same basis or to be taken from
the table on page 129. Once correctly tensioned Optibelt Red
Power II V-belts need no retensioning.
Applications
Optibelt Red Power II wedge belts were especially developed for
mechanical engineering. The fields of application are among

optibelt VB Classical V-Belts to BS 3790 and DIN 2215
Construction/Properties
Optibelt VB classical V-belts are manufactured using the same
production processes as those for Optibelt SK wedge belts.
The components used are perfectly suited to the power ratings PN
shown in later tables. These values are significantly higher than
those quoted in BS 3790 or DIN 2218 and therefore offer a greater
factor of safety on critical drives.
G Optibelt VB classical V-belts have a belt width to belt height ratio
of approx. 1:1.6.
G The maximum belt speed vmax = 30 m/s should not be exceeded.
G The permissible flex rate is considerably lower that that for
wedge belts, at fB max = 80 per second.
Applications
Optibelt VB classical V-belts are employed primarily as replacements on industrial drives. For new drives, it is almost always
recommended that wedge belts be specified for reasons of space
and cost. However, special drives, such as V-flat, often can only use
classical V-belts. Similarly, difficult drives for agricultural and
horticultural machinery are often unsuitable for wedge belts by
virtue of the use of small pulleys or back bend idlers.For these
applications special belt constructions may be necessary. It is not
possible within this Manual to describe all of the special constructions or the calculation data applicable to them. It is therefore
requested that all details of such drives are forwarded to our
Applications Engineering Department for calculation and recommendation.
Standardisation/Dimensions
The Optibelt range also includes sections 5, 8, 20 and 25 from an
earlier edition of DIN 2215. These sections should, where possible, be avoided on replacement and rationalisation grounds.
The British and ISO Standards specify the datum length
for measuring and identifying the belt length. The
datum length is the circumferential length of the belt
measured at a datum width lp. The earlier DIN standard length designation using the inside length Li is
replaced by the datum length Ld. For the conversion
factors from pitch to inside length, please see page
141.

The advantages of the Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts are evident
where –
G extremely small pulley diameters
G high belt speeds
G extraordinary power transmission requirements
G high ambient temperatures
render the use of wrapped V-belts uneconomical and impractical.
Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts sections XPZ, XPA, XPB, XPC, 3VX/
9NX, 5VX/15NX, ZX/X10, AX/X13, BX/X17 and CX/X22 offer
the best technical and economic solutions for these conditions
through their use of high grade components coupled to the most
advanced production machinery.
Construction/Properties
Optibelt Super TX M=S belts consist of
The base compound consists of a polychloroprene rubber mixture
filled with fibres arranged to lie across the belt section. These
provide an effective support to the tension cord.
The result is
G very high flexibility
G high transverse stiffness
G considerably increased abrasion/wear resistance and
G insensitivity to slip
The use of a new type of polyester cord, specially developed
Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts imparts
G remarkably low stretch properties
to the belt.
This specially designed tension cord is securely locked into the
bedding compound. Perfect adhesion between the components is
ensured even under the highest dynamic loading conditions.
The fabric layers at the top of the belt support the tension cord and
contribute to the
G greater belt flexibility.
The fibre reinforced base compound, in conjunction with the
Optibelt tension cord and the moulded cog, offers increased and
more efficient transmission of power.
 optibelt SUPER TX M=S V-Belts – raw edge, moulded cogged –

The moulded cogs reduce bending stress and give outstanding
flexibility. As a result, significantly smaller pulleys than those used
with conventional fabric wrapped V-belts can be employed.
With Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts drive ratios (I) of up to 12 to
1 are possible.
Multi-stage drives can be eliminated.

Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts are more heat and oil resistant than

resulting in a
G significant reduction in cost.
Power Comparison
Pulley datum diameter dd = 140 mm
Ratio i = 1:1
Drive Calculation
Drive designs using Optibelt Super TX M=S belts should be
undertaken following the example given on pages 59 to 61. The
higher power ratings given in the relevant tables, apply. These are
based on a theoretical laboratory running time of 25,000 hours.
Belt Tension/Static Shaft Loading
Belt tension and static shaft loading are calculated as for wrapped
belts. The shaft loading is usually no greater than that for the same
drive using wrapped belts. It is often possible, due to a reduction
in the number of belts used, that the shaft loading could be lower.
The individual Super TX belt requires a higher tension than the
wrapped belt in order to utilise its greater power transmission
capability.
The precision ground sides of the Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts
ensure uniform seating in the pulley grooves, resulting in smoother
running.
Applications
The use of Optibelt Super TX M=S belts in borderline cases is
recommended wherever difficulties are anticipated with wrapped
V-belts.

Construction
The Optibelt KB Kraftbands are made up of individual V-belts
rigidly connected by a cover plate. This compact drive element with
single-belt-characteristics is also known as a joined V-belt. According to application Kraftbands are fitted with two, three, four or five
ribs. It is also possible to provide the cover plate with specially
patterned surfaces.
Raw edge, moulded cogged Optibelt KBX Kraftbands with the belt
sections 3VX/9JX, 5VX/15JX, XPZ, XPA, AX/HAX, BX/HBX are
available upon request in lengths from 1250 to 3550 mm.
Applications
Optibelt KB Kraftbands are predominantly employed for solving
problems associated with:
G pulsating run
G large centre distances in combination with small pulley diameters (long span lengths)
G vertical shafts
G reversing drives
G V-flat drives
G coupling drives
G conveyor systems (materials handling technology)
In mechanical engineering Kraftbands are successfully used for
example in screen vibrators, saw mills, stone crushers, road
construction machinery, pulpers, compressors, fans, lathes, grinding and milling machines.
In agricultural machinery Optibelt KB Kraftbands are also used as
coupling belts. Due to the single belt characteristics is is possible
to achieve smooth engagement.
For conveying, Optibelt KB Kraftbands can be supplied with
special top surfaces.
With these patterned top surfaces they are especially suitable for
transporting containers and heavy material, for example for
loading aircraft. See also the chapter on conveyor belts.
Kraftbands must be protected from direct contact with undesired
material such as stones, grit, wood shavings etc. In such operating
conditions the drive has to be protected by protective grid or similar
devices.
Standardisation – Optibelt KB Kraftband
Optibelt-KB Kraftbands with high-performance wedge belts are
manufactured according to international practice using sections
3V/9J, 5V/15J, 8V/25J. They comply with the standard ISO
8419 lengths in the reference system. The pulleys are standardised
to ISO 5290. 8419 lengths. The pulleys are standardised to ISO
5290.

Kraftband sets must be used for drives with more than 5 ribs. The
following combinations should be used.
Ordering Example
The drive of a mill is equipped with Optibelt KB Kraftbands, size
5V 1600/15J 4064 mm La. It was calculated with 18 ribs. In total,
4 Kraftbands are required - 2 belts each with 4 ribs and 2 belts each
with 5 ribs (see Table 6).
The order wording would then read:
1 set comprising 2 Optibelt KB Kraftbands 4-5V 1600/15J
4064 mm La and 2 Optibelt KB Kraftbands 5-5V 1600/15J

The ISO Committee TC 41/SC1 has used the American Standard
RMA/MPTA as the basis for this international standard. The
sections 3V, 5V, and 8V have been designated 9J, 15J and 25J
respectively.
Example: 9J
9 = approx. 9 mm nominal top width of pulley

Standardisation – Classical V-Belts
In the course of international and national standardisation,
Optibelt-KB Kraftbands using classical V-belts have been brought
into line with the USA Standard RMA/MPTA (A,B,C,D)and the USA
Standard ASAE S 211. ...(HA, HB, HC, HD). The RMA/MPTA
standard applies for the use of Kraftbands in mechanical engineering; the agricultural machinery standard ASAE S 211. ...applies
when using Kraftbands in agricultural machinery. Despite the
different section designation, the belt cross sections are identical
in both standards.
The pulleys are standardised according to ISO 5291.
Optibelt-KB Kraftband SPZ, SPA, SPB and SPC
Optibelt KB Kraftbands are employed for extreme shock loads,
large centre distances in combination with comparatively small
pulley diameters and vertical drives. They are used for coupling
drives and for conveying works. With the same power transmission, the Kraftband offers better running properties and/or safety.
Optibelt Kraftbands with sections SPZ, SPA and SPC can be
applied in standard V-grooved pulleys according to DIN 2211 and
ISO 4183.
Drive Calculation
Drives using Optibelt-KB Kraftbands in mechanical engineering
are to be fitted as shown in the calculation examples on pages 78
to 80 of this manual using the power ratings of the relevant belt
sections. In ISO 5290, the nominal top width of the pulley groove
is specified as the base value. The position of the datum diameter
is given as an approximate value. For the geometric and power
calculation, the outside diameter is used. Small computational
differences in rotational frequency and speed ratio have no
practical effect.
For Kraftbands with classical V-belts, as a rule, the calculation uses
the datum diameter as well. The power ratings correspond to the
sections of the classical V-belts.
For conversion factors for Optibelt-KB Kraftbands, see page 142.
Drives on agricultural machinery employ special design calculations and methods. We, therefore, request
that you send us your technical details.

in a rubber cushioning compound. It is effectively supported by the
reinforced base compound and by layers of compound impregnated fabric around the outside of the section. For exceptionally
difficult drives layers of special cross cord material can be used
between the base and cushion compounds.
The special properties of the raw edge, moulded cogged, variable
speed belt are:
G high power transmission capability

Optibelt Super DVX Variable Speed Belts –
raw edge – moulded double cogged –
Further increases in demand on the performance of drive elements
and the trend towards designing ever smaller, space saving drive
units, led to the development of the double cogged, raw edge
Optibelt Super DVX variable speed belt.
Double cogged Optibelt variable speed belts make it possible to
employ the smallest diameter pulleys, even below Standard recommendations. The double cogged design improves heat dissipation
thereby significantly reducing the belt running temperature. The
production method and the structure of the belt have been derived
from the raw edge Super VX variable speed belt. Depending upon
the application, this belt can also be equipped with layers of
special cross cord material in the base compound. The belt is
double cogged, with the depth and spacing of the cogs matched
to the specific belt section. The polyester or Aramid tension cord
ensures ideal power transmission, increased service life, and
extremely low stretch characteristics.
The features of the Super DVX variable speed belt can be
summarised as follows:
G acceptance of extremely high axial forces
G high flexibility and low flex fatigue
G improved heat dissipation
G use with the smallest pulley diameters
G extremely smooth running at high belt speeds
G long service life

Optibelt VS Variable Speed Belts – wrapped
The first generation variable speed belt was the Optibelt VS. In its design, the Optibelt VS is similar to the wrapped, classical V-belt
or wedge belt.
This belt construction is still available.

optibelt DK Double Section V-Belts
Construction
A cross through the Optibelt DK double section V-belt reveals a
hexagon made up of two congruent trapeziums. The neutral axis
containing the tension cord is exactly half way up the.
Optibelt DK double section V-belts comprise:
Properties/Applications
The polyester tension cord positioned at the centre of the imparts
extreme flexibility and low stretch properties to the Optibelt DK
double section V-belt. The belt is therefore particularly suited for
flexing in different directions in the same plane. Optibelt DK double
section V-belts are used where several pulleys are arranged in one
plane and the direction of rotation of one or more of the driven
pulleys must be changed without crossing the belts. Because of the
positioning of the tension cord in the neutral axis and the special
shape of the double section V-belt, the tension cord is not subjected
to any force other than tension unlike standard V-belts bent around
an outside idler. The Optibelt DK double section V-belt comes into
its own on typical serpentine arrangements. Special constructions
are also possible. In the main, double section V-belts are used on
agricultural machinery. They are, however, also finding increasing
use in industrial machinery applications.
Standardisation
The cross dimensions of the Optibelt DK double section V-belts
correspond to DIN 7722 and ISO 5289.
These are thes HAA, HBB, HCC and HDD, that equate to the USA
Standard ASAE S 211. ..., thereby ensuring an international
interchange facility.
The effective/nominal length of the Optibelt DK double section
V-belt is measured on the effective/outside diameter of the measured pulley. This length equates roughly to length of the belt at its
widest part, the middle length.
Conversion factors are as follows:
Section AA/HAA effective length = middle length – 4 mm
Section BB/HBB
effective length = middle length – 8 mm
Section CC/HCC effective length = middle length + 3 mm
Section DD/HDD effective length = middle length!
Experience has shown that, in practical use/ordering, these
conversion factors can be ignored.
Grooved Pulleys
No special pulleys are required for Optibelt DK double section
V-belts. Pulleys conforming to ISO 4183, BS 3790,DIN 2211,
DIN 2217 and ASAE S 211. ... are suitable.

Section CC/HCC in grooved pulleys for C/22-SPC
Section DD/HDD in grooved pulleys for D/32
Special Sections
For special applications, we also supply double section V-belts
withs 22 x 22 and 25 x 22. These are not standardised.
Drive Calculation
Drive calculations for Optibelt DK double section V-belts differ from
those given in this manual for two pulley drives. Multi pulley
calculations are so complicated that they cannot be shown here.
Effective lengths, rotational speeds, transmission ratios and belt
speeds are determined by the effective/outside pulley diameters.
Our  engineers will be pleased to assist in the design of drives using
Optibelt DK double section V-belts.

S=C plus ”SetConstant”.
This stands for wrapped V-belts that can be
used in a set without measuring.
The advantages are the following:
Saves energy, high efficiency of approximately 97% more
level transmission of performance
disposes of the well-known narrow S=C plus tolerances:
always by the nominal measure
extremely low stretch
longer service life
Set code numbers are not required
reduces vibrations
requires only little adjustment
reduces self-heating, thus ageing-resistant
longer maintenance intervals
Example for S=C plus length tolerances for a high-performance
wedge belt with 5000 mm datum length.
The dimension (A) is the tolerance permitted according to DIN of
an individual V-belt with a length of 5000 mm. If you want to
assemble sets for multi-groove drives, the individual elements may
not show deviations of more than 6 mm (B) among each other.
The tolerance of the Optibelt S=C plus V-belt is considerably lower
than the set tolerance permitted according to the standard.
S=C plus V-belts are always near the nominal length.
Standard Properties
According to the respective requirements, all Optibelt
V-belts are manufactured using carefully selected basic
materials and continuously updated technical procedures.
Regular routine checks during production, sophisticated lab tests and careful testing of the raw materials
used guarantee a uniformly high level of quality that
can be expected from every Optibelt drive element.
Reliability and long service life are considered the most
important criteria.
Oil Resistant
Oil resistance prevents damaging through
mineral oils and mineral fats, insofar as
those substances are not continuously and
in great quantities in contact with the Vbelts. Animal and vegetable fats as well as water-soluble cooling
and cutting oils result in any case in a reduction of the service life.
For higher concentrations, we recommend the use of our special
constructions “05“ and Super TX V-belts respectively.
Heat Resistant
Standard V-Belts allow ambient temperatures of up to approximately + 70°C. Higher temperatures lead to a premature
ageing and hardening of the V-belts. Therefore, we recommend in such cases the use of our special
construction XHR. For details see page 17.
Dust protection
Dust reduces the service life of V-belts
enormously. Wear-resistant fabric covers
make Optibel V-belts resistant to dust. This
is demonstrated by its continual application in cement factories,
mills, in the stone processing industries, and in the mining industry.
M=S Matched Sets
This stands for raw-edge moulded cogged
V-belts that can be used in a set without
measuring.
Due to specific manufacturing techniques, extremely narrow length
tolerances can be achieved so that V-belts of a nominal length can
be optionally combined. A precise edging results in a smooth
running operation. The even power transmission of all V-belts
ensures a high efficiency and thus helps save energy. Set code
numbers are not necessary, there is no set bundling. As a
consequence, storage and costs can be reduced.

Special Constructions
Anti-Static
Optibelt V-belts do have anti-static properties. In the case of V-belts
with inadequate antistatic properties, the electrostatic charge can
be so high that there is a risk of ignition due to sparking. The use
of anti-static belts requires a check of the required properties in
accordance with ISO 1813. We present proof of the anti-static
properties of the belts in the form of our final inspection certificate
according to EN 10204 ”3.1.B”.
We charge an extra fee for this additional service. We strongly
recommend your to order anti-static belts always separately.
Extra Heat Resistant V-Belts,
Special Construction XHR
The servicelife of standard Optibelt V-belts can be greatly reduced
due to the effects of temperature.
In case of ambient temperatures that vary constantly between
approx. + 70 °C up to approx. + 90 °C, we recommend our special
construction XHR. Special rubber compounds largely prevent
premature ageing and brittleness. In borderline cases, trials are
recommended, as individual drive parameters such as belt speed
and pulley diameter also have an influence on the belt life.
The following diagram illustrates the high degree to which the
ambient temperature influences the service life of V-belts. It shows
that the special construction XHR provides within the high-temperature range for a longer service life in comparison to the standard
design. However, you cannot expect the same service life as under
normal conditions. Alternatively you can also use Optibelt Super
TX under these conditions.

Smooth Running Selected V-belts,
Special Construction LR
Drives that have to fulfil high requirements with regard to smooth
running - that is with variations of shaft centre distances - like for
example lathes and grinders, and are supposed to guarantee a
vibration free operation, may be equipped with Optibelt V-belts
“selected smooth running”. Shaft centre distance fluctuations are
measured electronically on test machines. The measurements
comply with the Optibelt Works Standards or the conditions
agreed with our customers.
Mining Industry
Optibelt SK wedge belts and Optibelt VB classical V-belts are
approved by the State Mining Office of North Rhine-Westphalia
(LOBA NW) and the National Coal Board and can be used in
underground mining as well as in spaces and areas above ground
that are exposed to fire and explosion risks. Please request
information on sections and lengths separately.
Applications with Other Special Constructions
For particular applications such as general engineering machinery, agricultural machinery and horticulture, further special constructions are also available in intermediate sizes for
G special drives with tensioning, guide and idler pulleys
G coupling functions
G shock loads
G extreme operating conditions
These Optibelt V-belt special constructions can incorporate different tension cord types and arrangements with a variety of rubber
mixtures, different fabric qualities and a differing number of fabric
covers and top surface elements.
All special executions and intermediate lengths must be ordered in
sets or in multiples thereof.
It is not possible to describe all criteria within the framework of
these descriptions. For further information please contact our

Balancing
V-grooved pulleys are statically balanced in accordance with the
guidelines in VDI 2060, as standard:
Quality level Q 16; for dia. dd ≥ 400 mm at n = 1500 r.p.m.; for
dia. dd > 400 mm at v = 30 m/s.
The pulleys are balanced without keys on smooth balancing
spindles. Machines whose runners are balanced with a keyway
entered in the end of the shaft have to be ordered with the following
remark: “Balanced with pilot bore and empty key on smooth
balancing spindles without fitted keyway.”
Balancing in one plane to quality level Q 6.3 on request.
We recommend balancing in two planes to quality level Q 6.3, or
finer, when v ≥ > 30 m/s or the ratio or datum diameter to face
width dd: b2 is < 4 at v > 20 m/s.
In such cases, the pulley operational speed must be stated.

Pulleys – Standards – Design Criteria – Types
An essential component in V-belt drive systems is the V-belt pulley,
or V- pulley as it is usually termed. These pulleys are predominantly
made from GG 20 cast iron and are available pilot bored, finished
bored or with a taper bush.
The British and DIN Standards are based on the ISO Standard as
are the standards of all industrialised countries.
ISO 4183 Grooved Pulleys for Classical V-Belts and
Wedge Belts.
V-belt pulleys with grooves for wedge belts to BS 3790:1981 and
DIN 7753 Part 1 are also suitable for classical V-belts with the same
datum width bd to BS 3790:1981 and DIN 2215. These are known
as dual duty pulleys.
Example
The following should be observed in the selection of pulleys:
G Use standard pulley diameters.
If design considerations make this impossible, a standard
diameter should, as a minimum requirement, be chosen for the
largest pulley in the drive.
G Do not select a pulley smaller than the minimum recommended
size in the interest of belt service life and overall drive efficiency.
G If manufacturing your own pulleys, the overall shape and
machining must conform to the relevant Standards.
G Groove pulleys are generally balanced in one plane (statically),
to quality level Q 16 as in VDI 2060.
G Balancing in two planes (dynamically), quality level Q 6.3,
becomes necessary if:
v > 30 m/s or
the ratio of datum diameter to pulley face width dd:b2 is < 4 at
v > 20 m/s.
Note:  The timely replacement of pulleys damaged by corrosion
or erosion prevents premature failure of the belts.
Furthermore, it is essential that the belts should never run with their
inside circumference in contact with the bottom of the groove as this
can quickly lead to damage and premature failure (Exception:
special drives such as V-flat drives).
Deep Grooved Pulleys
Deep grooved pulleys are employed for special drive situations
such as,
G the use of guide idlers
G twist drives or
G drives subject to severe vibration.
The increased groove top width ”b1” and depth ”t” of deep
grooved pulleys improves the running characteristics of the belt,
particularly as it enters the groove. Belt turnover and run out are
prevented.
Deep Grooved Pulleys are not suitable for use with

For drives with several grooves the total of all deviations from the nominal value e for all groove distances of a pulley +/- 0.8 mm must not be exceeded. For further details
see US-Standard RMA/MPTA.
Note:
The permissible variations of the V-grooved pulley according to US-Standard RMA/MPTA deviate only slightly from the values contained in ISO 5290 “Grooved pulleys
for joined narrow belts” (Kraftbands). Therefore Optibelt KB Krafbands can be used for V-grooved pulleys manufactured according to both standards.
These V-grooved pulleys are also used for Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts.

The International Standard ISO 5290 specifies pulley groove
dimensions for belt sections 3V/9J, 5V/15J, 8V/25J. The groove
top width ‘b1’ is used as the basic reference dimension for
standardisation of the grooves and the joined V-belts. The pulley
groove and the joined V-belts are considered in the Standard ISO
5290 as a single unit.
The values of δ h1 and δ h2 were chosen to ensure that
1. the belt joining band does not come into contact with the outside
diameter of the pulley in order to avoid the belts separating from
the joining band,
2. the belts are still seated deep enough in the pulley grooves to
ensure full transmission of power.
b1 = effective width
da = effective outside diameter
δh2
The groove faces must be straight at least to the level of da - 2 δ h2.

Optibelt Nominal Power Rating PN – Arc of Contact Correction Factor c1
The Optibelt nominal power ratings PN in Tables 25 to 48 are
based upon an internationally recognised basic formula and a
theoretical belt life of 25,000 hours ander ideal conditions. This
formula contains material constants that take into account the
quality of the raw materials used and make allowances for
production methods. The special qualities of Optibelt V-belts made
it possible for example to use other material constants than those
given in DIN Standards. As a result, the nominal Optibelt power
ratings PN significantly exceed the ratings given, for wedge belts
in BS 3790 and DIN 7753 Part 2 and for classical V-belts in BS
3790 and DIN 2218, for the same theoretical belt life. The nominal
power ratings PN are based on the smallest loaded pulley in the
drive system. The belt power rating value PN is calculated taking
into account
G the datum diameter of the smaller pulley ddk
G the speed of the smaller pulley nk
G the drive ratio i
G an assumed arc of contact at the smaller pulley of = 180°
G a reference belt length for the specific belt section.
In order to account for the true drive data, based on the arc of
contact and the belt lengths employed, correction factors for the arc
of contact c1 and length c3 have been introduced.
If required, drive calculations can be provided for any theoretical
belt life.
Intermediate values for nominal power rating, arc of contact and
length correction factors can be foand by linear interpolation.
The factor c1 corrects the power rating PN when the arc of contact
is smaller than 180°, as the PN value was calculated on the arc of
contact β = 180° on the smaller pulley.

Service Factor c2
The service factor c2 takes account of the daily operating time and
of the type of driver and driven machine. It applies exclusively to
two-pulley drives. Other arrangements such as drives with tension
and guide idlers have not been taken into consideration. Pages
114-116 provide the relevant basic design guidelines for drives
with more than two pulleys.
Adverse operating conditions (e.g. aggressive dust, particularly high ambient temperatures or the effects of various media)
have not been taken into account. As it is practically impossible
to cover every conceivable combination of driver/driven machine/operating conditions in a summary that complies with the
relevant standards, the service factors are approximate
values.
In special cases, e.g. increased starting torque (direct
on-line starting of fans), on drives with frequent starts
and stops, on systems subject to exceptional shock
loads, or when significant masses are to be accelerated
or braked, the service factor must be increased.
Empirical value:
With a starting torque > 1.8, this figure is to be divided
by 1.5 in order to calculate the minimum service factor
c2. Example: Starting torque MA = 3.0; c2 selected 2.0.
Please consult our Applications Engineering Department for the solution of special problems.

Length Factor c3 for optibelt Wedge Belts and Kraftbands
The length factor c3 takes into account the flex rate of the belt based

Guidelines for Selecting V-Belt and Kraftband Sections
By using the following diagrams, the most suitable belt section as
far as efficiency and size are concerned, can be selected for a
specific application. The most efficient power transmission is
achieved by selecting as large a pulley diameter as possible for the
section in question. The limits to be observed are the maximum
permissible circumferential speed, namely Vmax = 42 m/s for high
performance wedge belts and Vmax = 30 m/s for classical V-belts.
Experience has shown that the minimum pulley diameters should be
avoided. These drives require a larger number of belts needing
wider pulleys, and are therefore more costly.
In borderline cases it is recommended that the next smaller section
belt be used on the same diameter pulley, as the smaller section will
often save both cost and space. A further recommended solution
is the use of the raw edge Optibelt Super TX M=S V-belts.
In such boundary areas it is advisable to design the drive with both
sections and then to select the most suitable.
Comparing space requirement and costs, the wedge belt normally
proves to be significantly superior to the classical V-belt for almost
all industrial machinery drives. For this reason, new designs use
wedge belts almost exclusively. It is only in special cases, for
replacement requirements and with V-flat drives, that the use of
classical section V-belts will be necessary.

V-Flat Drives
The V-flat drive comprises one grooved pulley and one flat pulley.
This type of power transmission can, under certain conditions, be
used for drives with intermittent loading or with a large moment of
inertia. As flywheels or flat pulleys are often already present, the
costs of the drive can be reduced. When converting a flat belt drive
to a V-flat drive, it will usually be economic to continue to use the
flat pulley.

V-Flat Drives
Calculating V-Flat Drives
The calculation of a V-flat drive uses the same method as the one
set out on pages 78 to 80. In order to ensure reliability and
efficiency, the V-flat belt drive must fulfil the following requirements:
G The V-grooved pulley must always be the small pulley.
G When using single belts, only classical V-belts sections Z/10,
A/13, B/17, C/22, D/32, E/40 must be used.
G Wedge belts must never be used as their narrow base and
larger relative height tends to make them turn on their sides and
twist.
G All Optibelt KB Kraftbands – both with wedge belts or classical
V-belts – are particularly suitable for this type of drive due to their
single-belt-characteristic. Turning over even under extreme
shock load conditions is prevented.
G V-flat drives are particularly economical when
The ideal drive dimensioning is achieved when kf = 0.85. If the
kf-factor falls outside the recommended range, it is more
economic to specify a normal V-belt drive.
G The following recommendations are made based on the above
requirements:
G When calculating the number of belts and the belt tension, it
should be noted that a special arc of contact factor c1 must be
used as shown in the following table.

Tension / Guide Idlers
Idlers are grooved or flat pulleys that do not transmit any power in
a drive system. As they also generate additional bending stresses
in the belt, they should be employed sparingly and, where
possible, confined to the following situations:
G with fixed drive centres, in order to produce the required tension
and to take up the maximum possible belt stretch and wear
G as damping and guide idlers on very long, unsupported spans.
Belts on such drives tend to vibrate more than normal and even
to turn over in the pulley grooves
G as outside idlers where the arc of contact on one of the loaded
pulleys is too low. Their inclusion increases the arc of contact
and often reduces excessive slip or eliminates the need to
increase the number of belts,
G as guide idlers on drives where the pulleys are not all on the
same plane such as quarter turn drives
G to guide belts past obstructions,
G as pneumatically, hydraulically or spring loaded idlers to
maintain an even, constant tension.
G as clutching idlers with which the driven pulley can be engaged
or disengaged. Complex clutches are no longer required.
Because of their single belt characteristics, Optibelt KB Kraftbands are particularly suited to these applications.
If, for the reasons listed above, it is absolutely essential to employ
idlers, the following criteria must be observed when designing the
drive:
G idler configuration,
G position of the idler in the belt span,
G idler diameter,
G idler shape,
G allowance for idler travel for fitting and for initial and subsequent tensioning of the belt,
G correction of the power rating PN
Idler Configuration
In principle, idlers can be used internally or externally depending
upon the drive situation.
Unless design requirements call for an outside idler, the inside idler
is usually more advantageous. Its diameter can be kept smaller
than that of the outside idler.
Depending upon the type of belt, inside idlers can either take the
form of a grooved or flat pulley.
For raw-edge V-belts and Kraftbands the same requirements as in
table 57 are valid.
Inside idlers reduce the arc of contact on the loaded pulleys and
with it the arc of contact correction factor c1. When calculating the
number of belts, the arc of contact correction factor should be
selected for the position of the idler at the point of maximum belt
stretch (See Table 58, page 116).
Outside idlers must always take the form of flat pulleys as they
run on the back of the belt. They increase the arc of contact. Care
must be taken to ensure however that the maximum possible belt
stretch is taken up and that contact with the opposite span is
prevented. The reverse bending caused when outside idlers are
used can lead to a reduction of the belt service life.

Fig. 3
On drives with long belt spans grooved pulleys are the preferred
choice for inside idlers because with flat pulleys transverse vibrations and belt turnover can occur.
Minimum Diameter for Inside Idlers
Inside idler ≥smallest loaded pulley in the drive system or
smallest permissible pulley diameter for the
section used.
Minimum Diameter for Outside Idlers
Outside idler ≥1.35 times the smallest loaded pulley in the
drive system.
Exceptions:
The belt service life is significantly reduced if the minimum
recommended idler diameter is less than the size recommended.
Idler Design
Grooved pulleys which are used as idlers can normally have
standard groove dimensions. On drives subject to severe vibration
and with long drive centre distances, it is recommended that deep
grooved pulleys be employed.
Flat pulleys should, where possible, be cylindrical and not crowned. Flanged pulleys are recommended as belt guides. The corners
formed by the contact surface and pulley flange should be sharp.
Round edges encourage the belt to run up on the flanges causing
turn over.
Tension / Guide Idlers
Position of the Idler in the Belt Span
Theoretical power transmission formulae and indeed practice has
shown that idlers should, wherever possible, be placed in the slack
side of the drive. The tension idler force can then be very
significantly reduced. A spring loaded idler must not be employed
in a reversing drive as the slack and tight sides of the drive are
constantly changing.
Our Applications Engineering Department will be pleased to assist
in the design where spring loaded idlers present special problems.
Fig. 1
Grooved pulleys can be used as inside idlers anywhere on the slack
side. Where possible, however, the arc of contact should be the
same on both pulleys when the idler reaches its limit position, i.e.
belt stretch is at its maximum.
Fig. 2
Flat pulleys, whether used as inside or outside idlers, are to be
placed as far as possible away from the grooved pulley on to which
the belt runs next. Any alignment errors between the idler and the
pulley and the resultant sideways movement of the belt on the pulley
are thus avoided.

Tension / Guide Idlers
The face width or the contact surface between the two flanges is
calculated as follows:
b = b2 + m
b = face width / contact surface
b2 = face width of the grooved pulley
m = additional value
Drive Calculation
Calculating the length and determining the number of belts is
basically the same as for two pulley drives. Certain details are,
however, to be noted:
1. Calculate the belt length over two pulleys using the formula: see
notes on standards page 66, 152/153.
Ldth ≈ 2a + 1.57 (ddg + ddk) +
2. If the belt has to be fitted with a fixed drive centre distance,
double the adjustment ”y” must be added to the belt length Ldth
(see pages 75/ 76).
Ld = Ldth + 2 y
3. The next largest standard length LdSt should then be selected. A
check should be made, usually on the drawing, to determine
whether the belt can be adequately tensioned with the idler in
the outermost position. In this idler position, both the standard
length LdSt and double the adjustment ”x” must be taken up (see
pages 75/76).
Ld for idler end position = LdSt + 2 x
Fig. 4
Number of Belts
The application of idlers increases the bending stress in the belts.
To avoid a reduction in belt service life, the idler correction factor
c4 must also be included in the calculation. This correction factor
takes the number of idlers into consideration whilst maintaining the
minimum diameter.
Table 58
Number of idlers
c4
The nominal power rating PN per belt is, as before, based on the
smallest loaded pulley. Calculation of the arc of contact correction
factor c1 must be based on the smallest contact angle of the loaded
pulley which occurs when the belt is stretched to its maximum limit.

Twist Drives
and exit angle between the belt and the pulley plane should not be
more than 5°. The required inclination of the shafts and the pulleys
relative to each other and the belt entry and exit angles should be
confirmed by practical tests. In addition, certain critical drives may
have a considerably improved safety factor if Optibelt special
constructions are used.
The most important types of twist drives and the associated design
guidelines are illustrated in the following text.
Drives in which the belt run is transposed are often simply termed
”twist” drives. These can be drives where the shafts are not parallel,
whose pulleys and idlers are not all arranged on one plane, or
drives with two parallel but counter rotating shafts. Because of the
twisting of the belt, this type of drive requires a certain degree of
lateral bending flexibility. The cross section of the V-belt is better
suited for this purpose than the flat belt. In most applications twist
drives use only single V-belts, but drives using belt sets are possible.
The crossing of the belt spans and the non-aligned entry of the belt
into the pulley leads to a reduction of the belt service life. The entry
Quarter Twist Drive Ratio i or 1: i > 2.5
Quarter Twist Drive Ratio i or 1: i < 2.5
Quarter Twist Drive
The term quarter twist drive is used to describe systems where the
shafts are at a 90° angle to each other.
The ratio i or 1:i on quarter twist drives should not be greater than
2.5.
Where this is not possible, a two stage drive should be employed,
in which one stage takes the form of a standard V-belt drive.


Twist Drives
Design guidelines for quarter twist drives
1.
amin = 5.5 (ddg + b2)
2. The drive must be aligned so that a straight line drawn through
the centre of the vertical shaft runs through the centre of the face
b2 of the pulley on the horizontal shaft (plan). The horizontal
shaft must be at right angles to this straight line.
3. The horizontal centre line of the pulley on the horizontal shaft
must be above and at a distance y1 from the centre line of the
pulley on the vertical shaft (elevation). The distance y1 changes
with the drive centre distance ‘a’.
Table 60
4. The direction of rotation must be arranged so that the tight side
S1 is at the bottom.
5. Deep grooved pulleys should be specified where possible for
single belt drives. This ensures an improved entry and exit of the
belt, thus preventing turnover.
6. Never specify deep grooved pulleys when using Kraftbands.
Kraftband pulleys should always be used. We recommend, in
any case, that our Applications Department be consulted.
7. When calculating the number of belts, the example given on
pages 78 to 80 should be followed. An arc of contact correction
factor c1 = 1 must always be used.
8. The static belt tension ‘T’ should be calculated using the formula
on page 113.
9. The drive centre distance must be adjustable so that the belt can
be fitted without force, the necessary tension applied, and the
belt stretch and wear taken up during its service life.

2. As far as possible, the crossover point of the belt should be
arranged in the centre of the belt spans. The rubbing of the belt
spans against each other is at a minimum at this point. In order
to avoid contact completely, it is recommended that a guide
pulley be placed in the slack side S2 near the crossover point.
3. Length calculation

4. Otherwise the design guidelines as detailed in points 4 to 9 for

Eighth twist drives
Eighth twist drives are seldom required. The shafts in this drive
system are at an angle of 45° relative to each other.
Design guidelines
1.
amin = 4 (ddg + b2)
2. Otherwise the design guidelines for quarter twist drives are
applicable.
Drives with 180° twist
The drive and the driven shafts are, as with conventional drives,
parallel to each other. The belt is twisted through 180° so that both
spans cross. A change in direction is thus achieved at very little
cost.
Design guidelines
1. In order to guarantee the perfect running of the belts in the pulley
grooves, the belt span length used must not be less than the
minimum set out in the following table.

Applications
The advantages of Optibelt V-belts and Kraftbands that use Aramid
tension cords are of special benefit where
G high power transmission levels are called for
G there are limitations on the drive width
G tthe adjustment available for tensioning is minimal
G the drive is exposed to high temperatures.
Thus, with the same number of belts and unchanged drive parameters, significantly higher power levels can be transmitted without
reducing the service life of the belts. Even drive designs that have
previously had to be classified as critical may now be considered
as risk free. Service factors are improved; minimal belt stretch
results in virtually maintenance free running.
For these reasons that Optibelt V-belts and Kraftbands with Aramid
tension cord are to be found on drives with exceptional loading
requirements -
G on critical drives in industrial engineering applications,
G on special machines,
G on agricultural machinery and
G on horticultural machinery.
Optibelt drive belts using Aramid tension cords may reduce the
costs of the total drive, as there is a saving in both weight and
volume due to the reduced installation width. They are oil resistant,
and heat resistant up to approx. 100 °C, and dust protected, as
standard.
A discussion of all the relevant criteria would be beyond the scope
of this manual. We therefore recommend that you contact our
Applications Engineering Department to discuss your specific
problems.
Special applications can also be designed with raw edge V-belts
and Kraftbands employing Aramid tension cords.
Drive Calculation
Calculation must follow the example given on
pages 78 to 80.
Please ask for the details of the higher power ratings.

requires the highest level of experience and know-how as well as
sophisticated testing facilities. Aramid is used as the tension cord
material for highly loaded V-belts and Kraftbands.
Construction and Properties
Compared to materials customarily used for tension cords e.g.
polyesters, Aramid is noted for its extremely low stretch properties.
Its tensile strength is almost double that for the same thickness of
standard fibre.
Despite its extreme stability, this fibre is remarkably flexible and
possesses sufficient elasticity to absorb shock loading or vibration.
These properties, which are of special importance for V-belts and
Kraftbands, result in huge improvements in comparison to conventional constructions.
Optibelt V-belts in Aramid cord construction comprise:
The high grade, specially processed Aramid tension cord is
embedded in a rubber compound. It is effectively supported by a
filler and base of polychloroprene and natural rubber compounds
containing transversely arranged fibres. The fabric cover is treated
on both sides with a rubber compound and completely envelops
the V-belt.

Belt Tension for optibelt V-Belts
The correct level of belt tension has a direct and crucial bearing on
the trouble free transmission of power and the achievement of
acceptable belt service life. Belt tension which is either too high or
too low often results in premature failure. Belts which are over
tensioned sometimes cause damage to the bearings on the driver
or driven units.
Experience has shown that the more common tensioning methods,
e.g. the ”thumb pressure method“ do not ensure tension settings
that would enable drives to be operated at optimum efficiency, It
is therefore recommended that the required static belt tension ’T‘ be
calculated for each drive using the Optibelt formulae. This tension
is the lowest possible required by a drive to transmit the highest
power level from the drive, taking account of the normal amount of
slip.
Once the belt has been fitted and the initial tension applied, it
should be checked using an Optibelt tension gauge. The belt
should be monitored regularly during the first few hours of
operation experience has shown that the first retensioning should
be undertaken after approximately 30 minutes to four hours
running under full load. This takes up the initial belt stretch and
”bedding in“ to the pulley grooves.
After approximately 24 hours of operation, it is often advisable to
check the drive and retension the belts if necessary, particularly
when not continuously run under full load. The time between checks
can then be significantly increased. Our installation and maintenance aids on page 130 - 132 should be observed.
An over or under tensioning of the drive will be avoided if the belt
tension is calculated, set and checked using one of the following
methods:
I. Checking the Belt Tension by Span Deflection
This method provides an indirect measurement of the calculated
or actual static belt tension. It is applicable for belt sections SPZ,
SPA, SPB, SPC, 3V/9N, 5V/15N, Z/10, A/13, B/17, 20,
C/22, 25, D/32, XPZ, XPA, XPB, XPC, 3VX, 5VX, ZX/X10,
AX/X13, BX/X17, CX/X22.
E = belt deflection per 100 mm span length
Ea = belt deflection for a given span length
= load used to set belt tension
(N)
k = constant for calculation of centrifugal force
= drive span length
Sa = minimum static shaft load
(N)
T = minimum static tension per belt
(N)
1. Calculate the static belt tension using the following formula:
When first fitted, the belt should be tightened to 1.3 x T i.e 30%
higher than the calculated belt tension.
T ≈
+ k · v2
500 · (2,02 – c1) · PB
c1 · z · v
2. Determine the belt deflection per 100 mm span length E from
the belt tension/deflection graphs Diagrams 8 to 11.
3. Calculate the belt deflection for a given span length Ea, for the
actual drive span length
Apply the load to set belt tension T (taken from Diagrams 8 to
11 for the appropriate belt section) to the centre of, and
perpendicular to, the span, as shown in the illustration above.
Measure the deflection and if necessary adjust the centres until
the correct belt tension is achieved.
II. Checking Belt Tension by Speed Measurement
This method checks belt tension using the theoretical slip. The
speeds of the driver and the driven pulleys are measured first in
an unloaded condition and then under load.
= slip
(%)
n1L = driver pulley speed, no load
(rpm)
n2L = driven pulley speed, no load
(rpm)
n1B = driver pulley speed, under load
(rpm)
n2B = driven pulley speed, under load
(rpm)
Formula for calculating the slip:
At the rated loading, the slip should not exceed 1 %. The belt
service life is considerably shortened due to excessive flank
wear and over heating when tension is too low and slip ensues
underload.

Belt Tension for optibelt V-Belts and optibelt KB Kraftbands
V. Belt Tensioning using a ”Length Additional Value”
It has become evident that span deflection methods are not ideal
for checking the tension of Kraftbands of all sections, and of
individual belts.  The following, very simple method for the
setting and checking of belt tension is therefore recommended:
1. Calculate the static belt tension ‘T’.
Example:
PB = 1136 kW
c1 = 0.97
v = 25.91 m/s
Drive arrangement with one set comprising:
2 Optibelt KB Kraftbands 4-8V 3750/25J 9525 La
2 Optibelt KB Kraftbands 5-8V 3750/25J 9525 La
T ≈
+ k · v2
500 · (2.02 – c1) · PB
c1 · z · v
T ≈
+ 0.69 · 25.912 = 1782 N
500 · (2.02 – 0.97) · 1136
0.97 · 18 · 25.91
2. Measure the outside length ”M” of the Kraftband or the single
belt, whilst slack.  The belt can be measured when fitted to the
drive provided that it is completely without tension.
3. Procedure
a) Fit the Kraftband or the single belt on to the pulleys.
Provisionally tighten the belt in order to seat it into the pulley
grooves.
b) Next completely slacken the Kraftband or the single belt.
c) Mark two lines on the top of the belt, distance ‘M’ apart.
The lines must be marked on the free span length, not
where the belt is on the pulleys (‘M’ should ideally be
1000 mm minimum or a multiple but in any case should
be as long as possible).
Important:
The longer the measured section, the more
accurate the tension setting will be.
4. Calculate the length additional value ‘A’ using the formula
5. Tighten the Kraftband or the single belt until the distance ‘M’ is
increased by the value ‘A’. The drive will now be correctly
tensioned.
6. If the drive is to be retensioned, the belt must first be slackened
off again so that ‘M’ can be marked completely without tension.
The procedure described under paragraphs 3. to 5. above must
then be repeated.
Tighten the Kraftband until the lines marked on the top surface are
‘M’ plus the length additional value apart. This will set the correct
tension.
When the belt is first installed the belt tension must be
multiplied by 1.3.

= 21.6 mm

Calculating the Axial Force/Shaft Loading under Dynamic Conditions
With drives having electric motors as the prime movers, care
should be taken to ensure that the dynamic loading can be safely
accommodated by the motor shafts and bearings to which it is
applied.
Experience has shown that drives on
G electric motors,
G internal combustion engines,
G turbines,
G and very heavy-duty drives such as stone crushers, calenders,
and heavily loaded mills,
call for the dynamic bearing load to be determined, that
is the shaft and bearing loads on both the driver and the driven
shafts.
Exact calculation of the ”dynamic axial force” saves the unnecessary expense of:
G premature bearing failure
G shaft failure or
G over designed bearings and shafts.
In the case of two pulley drives, the driver and driven shafts and the
bearings are subjected to the same dynamic axial force, but in
opposite directions. When idlers are employed, the magnitude
and the direction of the axial force are almost always different on
each pulley. If the magnitude and direction of the dynamic axial
force is to be determined, a graphical solution, using a vector
diagram for the dynamic forces in the tight side S1 and the slack
side S2, is always recommended.
If only the magnitude of the dynamic axial force is to be determined, this can be achieved using the formula for ”Sa dyn”. Data from
the calculation examples given on pages 59 to 61.

Belt tensioning for optibelt tension gauges
Optikrik
Tension gauges
This gauge serves a simplified method of
belt tensioning.
This simplified tensioning method should
be used for example when technical data
are not known and the optimum tension
therefore cannot be calculated. This method requires only knowledge of the diameter of the small pulley and the belt section
and construction.
The Optibelt tension gauge is used to read
off the belt tensioning. By reducing or
increasing the belt tensioning the desired
value can be obtained.
For different tensioning values, Optikrik 0,
I, II, III with corresponding measurement
areas are available.
This optibelt TT 2 Tension
Tester
is used for tension checking of
drive belts by means of frequency
measurement. Measurements are
in Hertz (Hz).
When belt parameters are entered,
tension is indicated in Newton (N).
Advantages of the tester:
G Non-contact, repeated measurements
G Wide measurement spectrum from
G High accuracy of measurement
G Quality evaluation of the measurement
result
G Storage in a data base
G Easy to use
G Universal measuring head for
comfortable measuring
G Data communication via PC

Tension gauges optibelt Optikrik
Instructions for use
1. The gauge is placed in the middle between the two pulleys on the back of the
belt, in the case of sets of belts ideally on
the central belt. Before doing this, ensure that the indicator is pushed down into
the gauge body.(First press the indicator arm onto the scale)
2. Lay the gauge loosely on the belts to be
measured and press a finger slowly on
to the pressure surface.
3. Try not to touch the gauge with more
than one finger during the measuring
process.
4. Once you hear or feel a definite click,
immediately release pressure and the
indicator arm will remain in the measured position.
5. Carefully lift the gauge without moving
the indicator arm. Read off the belt
tensioning (see diagram). Read off the
measurement at the exact point where
the top surface of the indicator arm
crosses the scale.
6. Reduce or increase the belt tensioning
according to the measurement result
until it is within the desired tension level.

Installation and Maintenance Aids
Safety: Before starting any maintenance work, it is extremely important that any machine components
are in a safe position which cannot be changed during maintenance work. In addition, safety
recommendations of the manufacturer are to be strictly observed.
optibelt KS V-Grooved Pulley with Taper Bush
The V-grooved pulleys are to be checked
for damage and correct dimensions before installation.
Installation (see figures on page 132)
1. All shiny surfaces like bore and end envelope of
cone of the taper bush as well as the conical bore
of the pulley have to be cleaned and degreased.
Insert taper bush and hub and align all connecting
bores. Half tapping holes have to face half plain
borings.
2. Stud screws (TB 1008-3030) and/or fillister head
screws (TB 3525-5050) should be slightly
greased and screwed in. Do not jet tighten the
screws.

Horizontal Alignment of Shafts
Motor and drive shafts are to be aligned using a spirit level, if necessary.
Note!
Maximum recommended shaft deviation 0.5°
Vertical Alignment of the V-Grooved Pulleys
The alignment of the V-grooved pulleys is checked before and after tightening the taper
bushes on a guide rail.
Note!
Check whether the face widths of the V-grooved pulleys have the same sizes. A
possible deviation of the face width has to be taken into consideration. With a
symmetrical face set-up, the distance of the parallel to the smaller face is half the
deviation.
3. Clean and degrease the shaft. Push pulley with
taper bush to the desired position on the shaft. See
alignment of the V-grooved pulley.
4. When using a keyway, it has to be inserted in the
hub of the shaft first. Between the keyway and the
bore hub there needs to be a certain tolerance.
5. With a socket wrench according to DIN 911 stud
screws and/or fillister head screws have to be
tightened uniformly using the tightening torque
stated in the table.
6. After a short operation period (0.5 to 1 hour)
check tightening torque of the screws and correct
if necessary.
7. In order to prevent the ingress of foreign material,
fill empty connecting bores with grease.

Installation and Maintenance Aids
Belt Tensioning
Use belt tensioning values according to Optibelt’s recommendations. Set the motor to
the given belt tension in a parallel mode. Operate the belt for some revolutions and
check the belt tension again. By experience, belt tension should be checked again after
an operation time of about 0.5 to 4 hours and corrected, if necessary.
* For further hints on belt tensioning see page 128.
Control Processes
We recommend controlling the drive regularly, e.g. after 3 to 6 months. V-grooved
pulleys are to be controlled for wear and consistence. Use the Optibelt section and
pulley groove template as aids.
When changing V-grooved pulleys with taper bush (see figure on page 132) the
following aspects have to be observed.
1. Loosen all screws. Screw out one or two screws depending on the bush size, grease them and screw
them into the proof test bore.
2. Tighten the screw or screws equally until the bush unscrews from the hub and the pulley can be moved
on the shaft freely.
3. Take off the pulley with the bush from the shaft.

After applying the initial installation tension the

and the parallel set to axis height are to be
measured. The maximum admissible values for the
distance X from the table should if possible be
fallen short of, depending on the diameter dd.
Depending on the pulley diameter, the intermediate values for X have to be interpolated.
Initial Installation
Always install the V-belts without using force. Installations using screw drivers,
crowbars etc. cause inner and outer damages to the belt. V-belts installed under force
might only run for several days. A proper installation of the belt saves you time and
money.
With too little setting range for the positioning, the V-grooved pulleys should be pushed
onto the shafts with the belts already fitted.

Storage
G General note on storage
Properly stored V-belts retain their properties for many years
(see also DIN 7716). However, when stored under poor
conditions or handled incorrectly, the physical properties of
most rubber products will be impaired. This can be the consequence for example of the effects of oxygen, ozone, extreme
temperatures, light, moisture or solvents.
G Storage area
The storage area should be dry and dust free. V-belts must not
be stored close to chemicals, solvents, fuels, lubricants and
acids etc.
G Temperature
V-belts should be stored at temperatures between + 15 °C and
+ 25 °C. Lower temperatures usually have no detrimental effect
on the V-belts. Since, however, belts become very stiff at low
temperatures, they should be warmed to approximately + 20 °C
before fitting to avoid fracture and cracking.
Radiators and supply pipes should be screened. V-belts should
be stored at least 1m away from radiators.
G Light
V-belts should be protected against light, especially direct
sunlight and strong artificial light with a high ultra-violet content
(ozone formation) such as naked fluorescent tubes. Illumination
using conventional light bulbs is advisable.
G Ozone
In order to counteract the harmful effects of ozone, warehouses
should not contain any appliances that generate ozone, for
example fluorescent lights, mercury vapour lamps or high
voltage electrical equipment. Combustion gases and vapours
which could lead to the formation of ozone by photo-chemical
processes must be avoided or eliminated.
G Moisture
Damp storage areas are unsuitable. Care must be taken to
ensure that condensation does not develop. The most favourable relative air humidity is below 65%.
G Proper Storage
Because stress can promote both permanent deformation and
cracking, care must be taken to ensure that V-belts are stored
without stress i.e. without tension, compression or any other
form of pressure.
If V-belts have to be stored horizontally and stacked upon each
other, it is recommended that the stack height does not exceed
300 mm in order to avoid permanent deformation. If, in order
to save space, V-belts are hung, the diameter of the cylinder on
which the belts rest should be at least ten times the height of the
belt section.
optibelt S=C plus and optibelt SUPER TX
M=S belts do not need to be stored in sets as they can
be formed into sets without having to be measured.
G Cleaning
Dirty V-belts can be cleaned using a 1:10 mixture of glycerine
and methylated spirits. Petrol, benzole, turpentine and the like
should not be used.
In addition, sharp objects, wire brushes, emery paper etc. must,
under all circumstances, be avoided as these can cause damage to the belt.

Length Measurement Conditions and Conversion Factors
Measuring the Belt Length
The belt is placed over two identically sized measuring pulleys with
the design of groove shown in the following drawings. The
dimensions are given in the Tables 63 to 69, on pages 141/142.
Pressure is applied to the adjustable pulleys so that the force Q is
applied to the belt. Before measuring the drive centre distance a,
the belt should be fully rotated three times under load. This ensures
that the belt is well seated in the pulley, an essential pre-condition
for the accuracy of the resulting measurement.
The length is obtained by adding the diameter of the pulley to twice
the drive centre distance a.
You will find the length conversion factors in the tables on pages
141/142 and 145/146.

Special Purpose Conveyor Belts
Product Description
Optibelt have developed a series of special purpose conveyor belts
for the economical transportation of goods in a varied range of
applications.

G Optimax HF high-performance flat belts
Construction / Quality
Special purpose conveyor elements are used in place of expensive
conventional type conveyor belts. They run individually, or in sets
adjacent to each other, transporting goods horizontally, or up or
down inclines. Vertical conveying is also possible if the belts are
arranged top surface to top surface gripping the articles between
them.
Table 71
CR/black is supplied as standard. We would be pleased to supply
details of other designs.

* = 65 for surface within the standard height
Properties
Special surfaced belts are used in place of expensive conventional
type conveyor belts. They run individually, or in sets arranged
adjacent to each other, transporting goods horizontally, or up or
down inclines. Vertical conveying is also possible if the belts are
arranged top surface to top surface gripping the articles between
them.
Applications
Here are just a few examples from the wide range of applications
in which Optibelt conveyor belts are used successfully.
For transporting:
G doors, cupboard components, veneer and plastic panels in the
woodworking industry
G body parts and sharp-edged sheet metal panels in the automobile industry
G cardboard and boxes in the packaging industry
G roof tiles, concrete slabs and paviors in cement works
G tiles
G sheet glass
G parcels
G bowling alley balls
In addition to conveyor applications, these belts are also used for:
G labelling and closing tins, bottles and jars in the preserves
industry
G lifting, topping and sorting beet, potatoes, lettuce, cauliflower
and sprouts and many other vegetables
Because of their single belt characteristics and high permissible
surface loading, Optibelt KB Kraftbands are especially suitable in
conveyor systems and lifting platforms for:
G transporting cargo containers
G loading and unloading aeroplanes and railway wagons
G stowing and discharging ships cargoes

Special Purpose Conveyor Belts
Design Guidelines
Drive and Guide Pulleys
The drive and guide pulleys should be V-grooved pulleys. The
minimum diameters should be selected in accordance with the
standard recommendations for V-belts and Kraftbands. See the
chapter on V-pulleys.
Due to the relatively low transporting speed (experience shows that
it is usually less than 1 m/s) and the resulting low flex rate, pulley
diameters can be reduced to approx. 10% below the recommended minimum. With greater reduction, there is the danger that the
top surface separates from the base V-belt.
The driver pulley should be arranged at the discharge end of the
conveyor so that the goods are pulled along.
Support Rollers / Tracks
In most cases, support rollers or tracks are
required to prevent the belt from sagging
under load.
Support rollers may be flat faced or V-pulleys.
The dimensions of the pulley grooves should
be such that the conveyor belt is supported at
its base in the groove ground, and can only
run with one edge along the pulley, and as a
consequence does not become trapped in the
groove.
The diameter and the number of support rollers required depends
upon the length of the conveying span and the weight and size of
the goods to be transported.
Support tracks, generally made of plastic, are either flat or with a
key seat to improve guidance of the conveyor belt. Like it is the case
with the support rollers, the grooves must be of an adequate width.
Adjustment of the drive centre distance allowances
The tables on pages 76 and 77 show the drive centre distance
allowances applicable to special purpose conveyor belts and
Kraftbands.
Options for Tensioning
An adequate belt tension is essential to the reliable
operation of the conveyor system. Tension is applied by
adjusting the drive centre distance or, when the centres
are fixed, by the use of tension idlers.
When idlers are employed, they should be arranged
inside the belt if possible, as otherwise the alternating
flexing of the belt will reduce its service life.
