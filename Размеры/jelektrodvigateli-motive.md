TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Motive motors are built according to
international standard regulations; each
size throughout the construction forms
is calculated with reference to the tables
of standard IEC 72-1.
Motive asynchronous three-phase Delphi
series motors are closed, and externally
ventilated.
The frame, up to 132 included, is made
in die casting aluminium alloy, from size
160 up to 355 the frame is made in cast
iron.
All motors are
multiple voltage
multi-frequency 50/60Hz,
F class insulation,
S1 continuous duty service,
IP55 protection
1 or 2 efficiency class
tropicalized.
motive motors adopt only bearings selected for
their silence and reliability and, for the same
objectives, the cage rotor is dynamically balanced
according to IEC 34-14 and ISO 9921 norms
Blocking the bearings into
their slots with snap rings
prevents them from
moving axially. From type
90, a steel insert is
provided in the bearing slot
of the aluminum flanges,
to resist to radial
mechanical forces with a
fair degree of security
The copper is impregnated with a
double layer of H class insulating
enamel to ensure high resistance
to electrical, thermal and
mechanical stress.
The phases are further isolated by
another layer of Nomex film to
protect the motors from the voltage
peaks that usually occur when the
motor is controlled by an inverter.
PATENTED


Aiming the maximum
protection, the motors
are equipped with
important details like the
pull-resistant cable press
and the combination of
bearings with two shields
each with rubber seal
rings
Performance excellence is
granted by the FeV magnetic
lamination sheets adoption,
instead then the usual normal
FeP01, FeV lamination
sheets provide higher
efficiency, lower heating,
energy saving and longer life
to isolation materials
To protect them by the rust,
motive motors are painted in
silver RAL9006 colour
From size 56 to size 132, feet are
detachable, and can be fixed on 3
sides of the housing, thus permittig
the terminal box to be positioned
up, right or left.
Cable press can be easily
moved on both the sides
of the connection box,
thanks to the screw cap
the connection
box can be
rotated of 360°
with steps of 90°
From size 160 and up, due to
the high torque, the motors are
fixed by feet that are die-casted
with the iron frame

There are no requests
about minimum efficiency,
but it is defined clearly
which are the motors
classified efficiency 1, 2
and 3.
Motive has organized its
production respecting the
parameters indicated by
the new European
classification.
Client’s benefits are of
many kinds
The European Agreement issued by the European Commission and CEMEP (European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics), establishes a new
classification system of electric motors based on the efficiency. The reference values are shown by the attached diagram and the following paragraph.
EFFICIENCY
BILL EFFECTS
Bill effects are the first to be in
evidence.  The calculation changes
d e p e n d i n g  
b y  
t h e  
u s e
circumstances, but we can say
that efficiency 2 motors allow a
saving of about 20%. For instance,
a 15kW motor, for an operation
period of 6.000 hours per year,
can save about 2 MWh/a or
more: about 100 Euro of yearly
operation costs
DURABILITY EFFECTS
Higher efficiency motors heat less,
slowing down the aging cycle of the
insulating materials and living longer.
Average operating life of Eff.2 Motive
motors is:
2500 hours/ year for motors up
to 15kW
4000 hours/year for bigger motors
The average life is approximately
from 25 to 30.000 hours for the
first and 50,000 for the second
ones
AMBIENT EFFECTS
Efficiency 2 motors guarantee
great energy and money savings,
with an objective of sustainable
development, reduction of CO2
emissions and consequent
improvement of the quality of the
atmosphere
HOW TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT
MOTOR?
High efficiency can be seen in many
ways: like the relation between
output power and input absorbed
power, or like a measure of the
losses that born when converting
the electric power in mechanical
energy.
From another perspective, high
efficiency motors consume less
energy to produce the same torque

data at 400V 50Hz
Instead, no standard prescribes a
maximum loosing factor for Fe P01
lamination sheets; although we can
say that generally this is at least
the double of FeV lamination
sheets,
not even this data can be
guaranteed. This is a source of
potential performance diversities
between motor and motor.
The reason of a longer life is based
on the lower heating that lengthens
the ageing cycle of the insulation
materials.
Between all the raw materials that
compose an asynchronous electric
motor, lamination sheets iron is
t h e  
m a i n  
p e r f o r m a n c e
discriminating factor.
The main advantages given by the
adoption of silicon magnetic
laminations are:
• higher efficiency
• better guarantees on the quality
constancy, assured by
tolerances reported in
international norms
on the shaft. Basically, an high
efficiency motor is the result of
precise workings, lower frictions,
a dynamically balanced rotor,
smaller space between rotor and
stator and of the use of better
materials. The main factors for
the design are based on the choice
of the type of lamination sheets
and windings with a greater coil
number and a bigger diameter
wire..
Among all materials that compose
a motor, laminations have the
highest influence on performance
SILICON MAGNETIC LAMINATIONS
Motive motors are made with FeV
magnetic lamination sheets, rather
than the customary normal Fe P01
iron lamination sheets.
Further than raw material, the
sheets thickness is another
performance source.
In fact, the thinner is the sheet,
the higher are the performances.
The lamination sheets Fe P01
can reach up to 1mm thickness.
FeV magnetic lamination sheets
have a 0,5mm maximum
thickness.
Composition and thickness give to
magnetic lamination sheets a very
low W/Kg loosing factor:
Lower specific losses mean less
magnetising current for the same
Power and torque (thus less
heating).

DUTY SERVICE
All Motive motors shown in this catalogue
are made for S1 continuous duty service,
as per IEC 34-1 norm. The duty service
class is shown on the rating plate.
Below are described the various types of
service:
S1 - Continuous service:
operating at constant load of duration
N in order to reach a thermal balance.
S2  Limited-duration service: operating at
constant load of duration N, less than
the time necessary to reach a thermal
balance followed by a rest period
sufficient in order to restore the balance
between the machine temperature and
that of the cooling fluid, with a tolerance
of 2° C.
S3 Periodic intermittent service:
sequence of identical operating cycles,
each including a period of operation at
constant load N and a rest period R.
In this type of service, the cycles is
such that start-up does not significantly
affect the peak temperature.
For S2 or S3 duties, the rated
powers mentioned in this catalogue
for S1 service can be increased
according to tables that you can ask
to the R&D dpt of Motive.
S4 - Periodic intermittent service with startup: sequence of identical operating
cycles, each including a substantial startup stage D, a constant-load operating
period N and a rest period R.
S5 - Periodic intermittent service with electric
braking: sequence of operating cycles
as for S4, with the addition of a rapid
electric braking F.
S6 Uninterrupted periodic service with
intermittent load: sequence of identical
operating cycles, each including a
constant load operating period N and
a no-load period V.
No rest time is included
S7
Uninterrupted periodic service with
electric braking: sequence of operating
cycles as for S5, but without a rest
period
S8  Uninterrupted periodic service with
correlated load and velocity variations:
sequence of identical operating cycles,
each of which includes a constant-load
operating period N corresponding to a
pre-set rotation speed, followed by one
or more operating periods with other
constant loads N2, N3, et.,
corresponding to different rotation
speeds. There is no rest period.
S9  Service with non-periodic variations in
load and speed: service in which the
load and speed generally vary in a nonperiodic fashion within the admissible
operating field. This service includes
frequently applied overloads which may
be greatly superior to the full load.

WORKING CONDITIONS
HUMIDITY:
The electrical equipment must be able to
work with a relative humidity between 30
and 95% (without condensation).
Damaging effects of occasional condensation
must be avoided by adequate equipment
design or, if necessary, by additional measures
(for example, built-in heating or air-conditioning
equipment, drainage holes).
ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE:
the powers indicated are intended for regular
use at altitudes below 1000 mt above sea
level and a room temperature between +5°C
and +40°C for motors having a rated power
below 0.6 kW, or between -15°C and 40°C
for motors having a rated power equal to
or greater than 0.6 kW (IEC 34-1): For
working conditions
rather than those specified (higher altitude
and/or temperature) the power decreases
of 10% each 10°C of higher temperature,
and of 8% for each 1000 mt of higher
altitude.
It is not necessary to reduce the rated power
if at an altitude higher than 1000mt and
lower than 2000mt there is a max ambient
temperature of 30°C or, in altitudes from
2000 mt to 3000mt there is a max ambient
temperature of 19°C.
VOLTAGE - FREQUENCY:
The maximum variation of the supply voltage
is +-10%.
Within this tolerance Motive motors supply
the rated power.

INSULATION:
The copper is impregnated with a double
layer of H class insulating enamel to ensure
high resistance to electrical, thermal and
mechanical stress.
A NOMEX*/D.M./D.M.D./N.M./N.M.N./
M. film that wraps entirely around the coil
side insulates the copper and iron from one
another.
The phases are further isolated by another
layer of NOMEX*/D.M./D.M.D./N.M./
N.M.N./M. to protect the motors from
voltage peaks that usually occur when the
motor is controlled by inverter.
Below is a graph showing the operating
temperatures possible for stator windings
based on the insulation rating shown on
the machine plate
Motive motors are designed to conserve
wide margins against eventual overloads,
having a temperature rise that is, at rated
power, much lower than the operating
temperature limit given by
their insulation class. This fact
increases considerably the
motors life lenght. Such "∆T"
values are evidenced in the
following performance charts.
(See further details about "∆T"
at page 19)


MOTIVE MOTORS PROTECTION
protections must be chosen based on the
specific running conditions, according to
standards  EN 60204-1.
Protection for motors with a shaft power
greater than or equal to 0.5 kW with
continuous S1 service. This protection
may be achieved by means of a thermal
cut-out relay, which automatically control
a knife switch.
Protection against peak currents by
magnetic relay that controls an automatic
knife switch, or by fuses; these must be
set to the locked rotor current.
If the application requires, protection
against excessive speed of the electric
motor, for example if the mechanical
load may drive the electric motor itself
and thereby create a hazardous situation.
If special conditions or synchronised
operation with other machines or parts
of machines require it, protection against
power failures or dips by means of a
minimum voltage relay that controls an
automatic power knife switch.
The electrical protections on the motor
power line may not be sufficient to protect
against overloads. If the cooling conditions
worsen, the motor overheats but the
electrical conditions do not change, which
inhibits line protections. Installing built-in
protections on the windings solves
this problem:
PTO bimetallic device
this is a normally-closed electromechanical
device that opens electrically when the
threshold temperature is reached; it
automatically resets when the temperature
falls below the threshold level. Bimetallic
devices are available with various
intervention temperatures and without
automatic reset, per EN 60204-1.
PTC thermistor device
this device promptly, positively adjusts
its resistance once the threshold
temperature is reached. Motive
motors from type 160 to type 355L
are equipped with 3 PTC thermistors
in the winding, with temperature
intervention of 150°C in Class F
motors (standard), or 180°C in H
Class motors.
PT100 device
this is a device that continuously,
increasingly adjusts its resistance
according to the temperature. It is useful
for constant measuring of the
winding temperatures using electronic
equipment.
ENCODER
motors with encoder or special shaft configurations for encoder mounting are
available upon request. In this case, assisted power cooling is also available,
supported by brackets on the fan cover

The separate brake power supply is achieved, whenever needed, by connecting directly
to the brake terminal board located inside the motor terminal box.

The adjustment is made by using the threaded
bushes , using a thickness gauge to make
sure that the wished air gap is reached.
Braking torque adjustment
The braking torque can be increased by tightening the adjuster screws .
Two different types of adjustment are possible
S air gap adjustment
For proper operation, the air gap S between electromagnet 
 and the mobile armature  must
be between the following indicated limits:
When the power supply is interrupted, the
excitation coil 
 is no longer powered and
therefore doesn’t exert the magnetic force
necessary to restrain the mobile armature ,
hwich, pushed by the pressure springs ,
compresses the brake disk  against the motor
flange  on one side and the armature itself on
the other, thereby creating a braking action.
The Delphi ATDC series brake is an
electromagnetic brake with negative
operation, whose braking action is exercised
in the absence of power supply.
The brake insulation class is F.
The brake lining is asbestos-free, as per
most recent EEC Directives in terms of
Workplace Hygiene and Safety.
The rectifier is of Mosfet type, with
protection varistors at the entry and the
exit.All brake assemblies are protected
against corrosion by painting and/or heat
galvanizing. The parts most subject to wear
are treated in special atmospheres that
provide considerable wear resistance to
the parts.

DELTA CONNECTION
Delta connection is obtained by connecting the end of a
phase with the beginning of the following one.
The phase current Iph and the phase voltage Uph are
repectively:
Iph = In / 3 -2
Uph = Un
where In and Un are referred to Delta connection.
WIRING DIAGRAMS
Motive three phase motors can be connected “Star” or “Delta”.
STAR CONNECTION
Star connection is obtained by connecting together the terminals
W2, U2, V2 and supplying the terminals   U1, V1, W1.
The phase current and voltage are respectively:
Iph = In
Uph = Un / 3 -2
where In is the supply line current and Un is the supply line
voltage of Star connection

The general electrical specifications are listed in the performance charts that follow. To understand their contents, the following general definitions are provided.
TECHNICAL DATA
Rated Current:
“In” is the Rated Current, expressed in
Ampere, absorbed by the motor when
supplied at Rated Voltage Vn (V) and giving
the Rated Power Pn (W) and it is obtained
by the formula
In the following tables, the rated currents
are referred to a Voltage supply of 400V.
For other voltage supplies the absorbed
rated current can be considered inversely
proportional to the voltage supply.
EX:
Motive motors can face also temporary
overloads, with Current increases of
1.5 times the rated current for at least
2 minutes.
Starting current (or locked rotor current):
(you see diagram)
Rated Power:
it is the mechanical power measured at
the shaft expressed, according to the
latest indications of international
Standards Committees, in Watts or
Kwatts. However, in the engineering
sector it is still common to refer to
power in terms of HP
Rated Voltage:
the voltage to be applied to the motor
terminals in accordance with the
specifications in the following tables
Frequency:
All electrical data in this catalogue refer
to three-phase wound motors at 50 Hz.
These may be connected to 60 Hz,
taking into account the multiplier
coefficients in the table below
Synchronous speed:
is expressed in rpm and it is obtained
by the formula
f 120/p
f= supply frequency Hz
p= number of poles pairs
Rated torque:
Cn is expressed in Nm, and it corresponds
to the rated power and rated rpm. It is
given by the It is given by the multiplication
of the force for the arm (distance) and it
is measured in Nm because the force is
expressed in in Newton and the distance
in metres. The rated torque value is
obtained by the formula
Cn (Nm) = Pn x 9550 / rpm
Pn= Rated power in KW
rpm= rated rotation speed
Starting torque (or locked rotor
torque):
Cs is the torque that the motor can
provide with the rotor at a standstill
and the rated power supply.
Maximum torque:
Cmax is the maximum
torque developed by the motor
at the rated power supply, at a
certain speed. It represents also
the value of the resistant torque
after which the motor stops.In the following
performance charts, it is indicated the
relation between maximum torque and
rated torque and maximum torque
Efficiency:
η is expressed in % and it is given by
the relation between the output Power
and the addition of output Power and
the electric losses of the motor, that
is the input power absorbed by the
motor. The electric motors losses are
mainly of two kinds: for joule effect
(rotor and stator) and iron losses.
The latest cause essentially heat.
An higher efficiency means energy
savings, lower heating, longer life
of insulating materials.
The smaller a motor is, the more
the presence of a double lip oil seal
as the ones used on the drive end
of Delphi flanged motors (B5 or
B14) may affect, following the
friction generated, performance.
The motors B3 up to size 132,
however, have V-rings with an
almost non existent level of
friction. For simplicity, the
following performance tables
indicate the levels of absorption
and performance measured
on B14 motors for size 56 and B3
motors for size 63 and above.
Power factor or cosϕ:
it represents the coseno of the voltage
and current gap angle.

Noise:
The noise is expressed in dB(A). The
measures must be taken in accordance with
the standard ISO 1680-2, in order to find
the Sound Power level LwA measured at 1m
of distance from the perimeter of the
machine.
EN 60034-9 standard describes the acoustic
Power limits to be respected, indicating the
maximum sound power level LwA. The noise
values indicated in the performance charts
that follow are referred to a no-load motor
working, supplied at 50Hz and with a
tolerance of +3 dB(A).
The moment of inertia can be calculated in
this way:
J = (1/2) x M x (R2)
Where M [Kg] is the rotation mass, while R
[m] is the ray of the volume at cylindrical
symmetry.

The data of each motor are specified in
this catalogue like requested by the norm
IEC 34-1. This describes, in particular, the
following tolerances:
example of overload capability (=life bonus)
of an F class motor, with B class temperature rise
temperature rise ∆T:
The temperature rise "∆T" is the change in temperature of the entire winding of the
motor, including the wire placed deep inside the stator slots, when it is being operated
at full load.
For example: if a motor is located in a room with a temperature of 40°C, and then
is started and operated continuously at the rated power, the winding temperature
would rise from 40°C to a higher temperature. The difference between its starting
temperature and the final inner
elevated temperature, is the ∆T.
Almost all our motors are
designed to offer a temperature rise
of B class or even lower, while their
insulation system is min in F class.
This extra margin gives the motor a "life
bonus". As a rule of thumb, insulation life will
be doubled for each 10 degrees of unused
insulation temperature capability.
The most common method of measuring the
temperature rise of a motor is based on the
differences between the cold and hot ohmic
resistance of the winding.
The formula is:
∆T [°C] = (R2-R1)/R1*(234,5+T1)-(T2-T1) Where:
R1 = Cold winding resistence in Ohms
(just before that the test begins)
R2= Hot winding resistance in Ohms
(when the motor has reached its
thermal equilibrium)
T1= ambient temperature in °C when test begins
T2= ambient temperature in °C when test is stopped
To change ∆T from Centigrade to Fahrenheit:
°C (∆T) x 1,8
Note: The motor surface temperature will never
exceeed the internal temperature of the motor, and
will depend upon the design and cooling
arrangements.
