Coupling Selection Guide
Page 11
At installation all couplings should be aligned as near to 
perfect as possible.
1. Angular
Angular misalignment is present when the shaft axes are 
inclined one to the other. Its magnitude can be measured at the 
coupling faces.
2. Parallel Offset
Axial misalignment is present when the axes of the driving and 
driven shafts are parallel but laterally displaced.
3. End ﬂoat (axial)
End ﬂoat is the ability to accommodate a relative axial 
displacement of the connected shafts; achieved by sliding 
members or ﬂexing of resilient components.
4. Torsional ﬂexibility
Torsional ﬂexibility is a design feature necessary to permit shock 
and impulsive loadings to be suitably dampened. It is achieved 
by the provision of a ﬂexible medium such as rubber, springs, 
etc., between the two halves of the coupling.
Selection
In order to select the correct type and size of coupling, the 
following basic information should be known:
Power to be transmitted
(a) Normal.
(b) Maximum.
(c) Whether continuous or intermittent.
Characteristics of the drive
(a) Type of prime mover and associated equipment.
(b) Degree of impulsiveness of driven load.
Speed in revolutions per minute
(a) At which normal power is transmitted.
(b) At which maximum power is transmitted.
(c) Maximum speed.
Dimensions of shafts to be connected
(a) Actual diameter.
(b) Length of shaft extension.
(c) Full keyway particulars.
Selection
When the input drive is not steady (i.e. not from an electric 
motor), and/or the driven load is impulsive, the actual power is 
multiplied by a Service Factor from the Table 2 (page 13).
Selection Procedure
1. Nominal power in kW to be transmitted = K.
2. Select appropriate load classiﬁcation from Table 1, denoted 
as either S, M or H.
3. From Table 2, establish Service Factor(s) to be applied, taking 
into account hours of operation/day and prime mover = fD.
4. From Table 3 select factor for the required frequency of 
starts/hr = fS.
5. Selection Power Ks = K x fD x fS
6. Equivalent power at 100 RPM = Ks x 100

RPM
7. Check that coupling selected will accept the required shaft 
diameters. Should shaft diameter exceed maximum permissible, 
then re-select using next larger size of coupling.
Flexible Couplings should be used to accommodate any combination of misalignment conditions 
described below.

Example of Selection
Coupling is required to transmit 7.5kW at 1440 RPM to connect 
an electric motor to a gear box driving a chain conveyor running 
for 18 hours/day and starting 15 times/hour. Shaft diameters 
/55mm respectively.
K = 7.5kW
From Table 1 Load Classiﬁcation = M (medium impulsive)
From Table 2 Service Factor fD = 1.5
From Table 3 fS = 1.2
Therefore selection kW is:-
Ks  = K x fD x fS
= 7.5 x 1.5 x 1.2
= 13.5 kW
Equivalent power at 100 RPM  = 
Ks x 100

RPM

= 
13.5 x 100

1440

=  0.9375kW @ 100RPM
From page 17 selection is RSC110 (644911) 
(maximum bore 55 mm).
Key Stress
1. Permissible key stress = 70N/mm2
2. Nominal torque TKM = k x 9550 / RPM Nm
3. Force at key F = TKM /r
4. Shaft Rad r. metres
5.  Key area A = J x HUB length mm 
(Obtain from relevant catalogue page).
6. Key stress fk = F/A N/mm2
7.  If resultant stress is less than 70 N/mm2 key stress is 
acceptable.
If resultant fk is greater than 70, consider either two keyways 
or extending hub length.
8. Example:

TKM = 7.5 x 9550/1440 = 49.7Nm

r = 55/2 = 27.5mm ÷ 1000 = 0.0275M

F = 49.7/0.0275 = 1741N

A = 16 x 45 = 720mm2

fk = 1741/720 = 2.4M/mm2

Selection is therefore good.
For operation above 80% of the declared maximum coupling 
speed it is recommended that the coupling is dynamically 
balanced.

Catalogue ratings shown are nominal values at 1.50 degrees.
For values at misalignments less than 1.50 degrees:-
Multiply nominal catalogue values by factor in table left.
e.g.
GF6DA at 1.50º = 104668 Nm
at 0.75º = 104668 x 1.30:-
GF6DA at 0.75º = 136068 Nm
Long hub versions available. Contact Renold for details. 
See key stress calculations on page 13.
* Maximum Bore - The maximum bores shown are absolute maximums. 
Under normal circumstances the boss to bore ratio should not be less than 1.5 for standard applications. 
Consult Renold for overbore approval.
** Speed in excess of these shown may require additional balancing.
*** Hubs may be reversed to increase DBSE (F2 + F3 above). If axial movement is allowed with both hubs 
reversed, a stop plate should be fitted to prevent hubs disengaging from outers.

D series
D Series Single Engagement couplings 
are commonly used in pairs with 
a ﬂoating shaft to connect widely 
separated equipmant, accommodating 
offset, angular or combined 
misalignment.
Universally used for pinch roll, shear 
drives and tension bridles on auxiliary 
rolling mill equipment. 

* Maximum Bore - The maximum bores shown are absolute maximums. Under normal circumstances 
the boss to bore ratio should not be less than 1.5 for standard applications. Consult Renold for 
overbore approval.
Specify misalignment angle ± 3.5° or ± 6°.
Gear Teeth are induction hardened.
Shrouded bolt flanges available if required.
Offset capacity is dependant on shaft length, please consult Renold for max permissible speeds.

Torsionally rigid steel coupling
Renoldﬂex is a range of couplings that utilizes a stainless spring 
steel disc pack to provide a positive ‘backlash free’ drive.
The coupling consists of two carbon steel hubs that are 
connected to the disc packs with a system of micrometric 
precision bushings and high tensile steel screws. This 
construction provides a backlash free and torsionally rigid drive 
with the additional beneﬁt of a 100% steel construction. 
The Renoldﬂex range of couplings is based upon a modular 
component assembly; therefore it can be easily adapted to suit 
a wide variety of applications and design situations: 
The Renoldﬂex type A uses a single disc pack and two hubs. It 
permits both axial and angular misalignments. This arrangement 
guarantees the highest torsional stiffness for this range of 
couplings. A special vertical support can be produced to allow 
for vertical or inclined mounting of the type A arrangement.
The Renoldﬂex type B uses two disc packs, two hubs and a 
spacer. It permits axial, angular and radial misalignments. The 
spacer component can be supplied in several lengths to allow 
for different axial dimensions.
A torsionally stiff, backlash free coupling with misalignment capacity. Designed for use at high 
speeds and in high temperatures.
Coupling capacity
• Maximum power @ 100rpm: 482kW
•  Maximum torque: 46000Nm

Renoldﬂex coupling size selection
In order to select the most suitable sized coupling, a number 
of service factors must be taken into consideration. These 
service factors make adjustments to the design torque 
(T) of an application to take into account factors such as 
misalignment, load classiﬁcation, driver classiﬁcation as well 
as high ambient temperatures to produce a selection torque 
(TS, where TS = T x fS). The most suitable coupling is then 
selected by comparing the selection torque (TS) and the 
couplings nominal torque (TN). Please note – it is important 
to ensure that the coupling selected will accept the required 
shaft diameters. Should shaft diameter exceed the maximum 
permissible then a larger coupling should be selected.
The total service factor fS = f1x f2 x f3; where f1 is the 
misalignment factor, f2 is the load classiﬁcation factor and f3 is 
the temperature factor. Note; the load classiﬁcation factor is 
weighted depending upon the prime mover classiﬁcation. These 
service factors are deﬁned below: 
Misalignment factor f1
The maximum misalignments quoted within the technical data 
for the Renoldﬂex coupling range cannot be present at the 
same time. Therefore, the presence of any axial misalignment 
∆ax reduces the possibility for offset misalignment ∆rad and 
angular misalignment ∆ang, which can be seen in [ ﬁg 02 ]. The 
combined total angular misalignment ∆TOT is a function of the 
angular misalignment ∆ang and offset misalignment ∆rad of the 
shafts, according to the following formula:
∆TOT [°]= ∆ang + arctan  ∆rad 
The values H and B [mm] are given in the overall dimensions 
table. The misalignment factor f1 is a function of ∆TOT as shown 
in [ ﬁg 03 ].
Load factor f2 
The following load factors apply for machines operated by 
electric or hydraulic motors as well as steam or gas turbines.

Operating principles
Page 57
DRIVEN IMPELLER (B) (OR TURBINE)
DRIVING IMPELLER (A) (OR PUMP)
OUTER COVERS
INPUT
OUTPUT
The coupling is partially ﬁlled with hydraulic oil to a level suitable 
for the absorbed power of the application and the acceleration 
characteristics of the driven machinery. The optimum oil ﬁll is that 
which just allows the driven machine to accelerate from rest, thus 
providing the best drive overload protection.
Power is supplied to the input side of the coupling by either an 
electric motor or diesel engine. This causes the driving impeller 
(A) [ ﬁg 07 ] to be rotated at motor speed, oil is thrown outwards 
by centrifugal force. The ﬂow of oil is directed across the blades 
of the impeller towards the opposing turbine (B). Kinetic energy is 
absorbed by the turbine and translated into torque, which is always 
equal to the input torque and produces rotation of the output 
member (in the same direction as the driver).
The low resistance of the impeller at start up allows the motor 
to quickly accelerate to full speed. The driven load accelerates 
smoothly to within a small percentage of the motor speed.
This speed difference is referred to as slip and must always be 
present for the successful operation of a ﬂuid coupling.
Typical values of slip will vary between 2% (large power) and 6% 
(small power).
All hydraulic couplings can be driven in either directions of 
rotation.
The input and output positions shown are standard, but the input 
can be from either side of the coupling.
The standard drive arrangement allows the outer cover to be 
rotated whilst at rest to facilitate oil ﬁlling.
However, if a brake drum or disc brake is ﬁtted, the brake should 
be at the coupling output. See page 65.

Delayed Fill
Page 58
Hydrastart Delayed Fill Chamber (Type HS...R)
HydraStart (constant ﬁll) hydraulic couplings having a maximum 
oil ﬁll will limit the starting torque to approximately 200% of 
nominal torque. It is possible to reduce this ﬁgure by reducing 
the quantity of oil in the circuit.
The disadvantage of this method is that it produces increased 
slip and higher operating temperatures. To overcome these 
problems a delay ﬁll chamber is available on sizes HS8 and 
above.
This chamber is a modular option and allows a calibrated oil 
feed into the working circuit. In this way, starting torque can be 
reduced whilst minimising slip under normal running.
[ ﬁg 08 ]
At rest [ ﬁg 08 ]
With the drive at rest, oil drains from 
the working circuit into the delay 
chamber.
Accelerating [ ﬁg 09 ]
At start up the coupling will transmit 
limited torque, allowing the motor to 
reach rated speed quickly. Oil ﬂows 
from the chamber to the working 
circuit proportionally to the speed.
Running [ ﬁg 10 ]
When the coupling achieves its rated 
speed, almost all of the oil is in the 
working circuit and the torque is 
transmitted at the minimum slip value.
[ ﬁg 09 ]
[ ﬁg 10 ]
The outer case of the Hydrastart coupling 
can become hot during operation. Do not 
touch the coupling or a burn may result.
!
CAUTION
Do not attempt to change the coupling oil 
during or soon after operation has ceased, as 
the oil may be hot and could cause burns.
!
CAUTION


‘Soft’ Starting
Page 59
Effect of starting on electric motors
If a machine is driven by a squirrel cage motor without the use 
of a HydraStart ﬂuid coupling, the following conditions arise  
[ ﬁg 11 ].
1. Motor will pull out 250/280% FLT.
2. Motor will consume 6 times FL amps.
3. Increase in motor temperature.
Star-delta starting reduces overheating. However, the starting 
torque in star is only 30% that in delta and it is often necessary 
to use larger or more complicated wound motors, particularly 
with high inertia machinery.
A = Locked rotor torque
B = Stall torque 250/280%
C = Normal torque 100%
I = Amperage
Effect of starting of electric motors 
when ﬁtted with HydraStart Couplings
When a drive includes a HydraStart coupling the motor starts 
on low load, with only an instantaneous current peak at switch 
on [ ﬁg 12 ]. At start up all the motor torque is available to 
accelerate the motor rotor and coupling impeller (pump).
The driven impeller (turbine) increases speed smoothly from 
zero rpm until the 100% slip curve intersects the motor torque 
curve at approximately 85% motor speed  [ ﬁg 13 ]. When the 
torque developed by the HydraStart coupling matches the 
resisting torque of the driven machine, acceleration of the load 
commences and continues up to running speed which will be 
between 94% and 98% of the driving speed depending on the 
coupling size.
HydraStart couplings ﬁtted on diesel engines
HydraStart ﬂuid couplings can be used with all types of 

 industrial machinery driven by internal combustion 
engines. [ ﬁg 14 ] shows typical engine and 
coupling performance curves.

 The horizontal curve represents the engine’s torque 
curve whilst the vertical shows the torque capacity 
of the coupling for different slip values and speeds. 
As load on the driven shaft increases it demands 
torque, causing the coupling to slip at higher level.

 If still greater loads are demanded then the coupling 
will eventually slip at 100%. Note this does not 
happen until the engine has developed peak torque.

 Thus by using a ﬂuid coupling, it permits an engine 
to develop maximum torque without stalling under 
load and promotes rapid acceleration to normal 
load speed.

Hydrastart Selection Chart
Page 60
Larger coupling sizes are available up to 2000kW at 1400 RPM
This chart may be used for the selection of coupling size. If your 
selection falls on a dividing line, always select the next largest 
size and use reduced oil ﬁll.
Hydrastart couplings can be used for up to ﬁve equi-spaced 
starts per hour.
Applications requiring more than ﬁve starts an hour should 
always be referred to Renold.
NOTE: Hydraulic couplings will not compensate for an undersized electric motor.
Rotating equipment must be provided with 
a suitable guard before operating or injury 
may result.

WARNING
It is the responsibility of the system designer 
to ensure that the application of the coupling 
does not endanger the other constituent 
components in the system. Service factors 
given are an initial selection guide.

Overload Protection
Page 63
When a hydraulic coupling experiences overload there is a
correspondingly high slip value accompanied by a rise in the oil
temperature. To prevent damage to the drive there are three
options available.
1. Fusible plug
This is ﬁtted as standard on all HydraStart couplings sizes 4 and 
above. The standard plug is set to fuse at 138°C. Another option 
available allows fusing at 183°C. Because oil is discharged when 
the plug fuses it is advisable to correctly guard couplings using 
this type of device.
2. Thermal trigger
Fitted as an option on HydraStart couplings sizes 6 and above, 
this device prevents oil being discharged from the coupling at 
overload. As with the fusible plug, two melt temperatures are 
offered. When melt point is reached a pin is released which 
engages with a limit switch. The signal from this switch can 
operate an alarm or switch off the electric motor to protect the 
drive. After the cause of the overload has been removed the 
drive can be restarted after replacing the thermal trigger.
3. Non-contact sensor
Non-contact speed and heat sensors can be supplied which shut 
down the drive in the event of overload. Please contact Renold 
for more information.
HydraStart thermal trigger

Operating principles
This device will trigger the limit switch if the oil temperature 
reaches a predetermined level without loss of oil from the 
coupling. Fusible trigger plug 117°C alternatively 138°C.
