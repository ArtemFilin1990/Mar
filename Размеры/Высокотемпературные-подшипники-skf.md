Customer benefits
G Doubly shielded
The extreme temperature bearings
can be fitted with protective shields,
one on each side, to prevent ingress
of solid contaminants and to keep
the lubricant in place.
G Environmentally safe
The SKF extreme temperature bearings use environmentally friendly
materials and do not emit any hazardous products provided that their
maximum allowable operating temperature is not exceeded.
Wherever very high or very low environmental temperatures are a limiting factor, a special bearing is normally needed. The application requirements – low
friction and high radial loads – define
the basic design concept as a deep
groove ball bearing.
If the application is demanding and
reliable operation under all temperature
conditions including extreme operating
temperatures with low operation costs
is mandatory, an SKF deep groove ball
bearing for extreme temperatures is
definitely needed.
Why SKF extreme
temperature bearings
are the perfect choice
Total quality is a must in modern industry. The SKF philosophy has always
been to satisfy customer needs and
total quality is a natural part of SKF
bearing design. This means that SKF
today has a very comprehensive range
of extreme temperature bearings in
terms of
G low life-cycle cost
G long service life
G high reliability
G minimised maintenance
These benefits make SKF extreme
temperature bearings the very foundation of trouble-free operation and total
quality. These bearings are truly exceptional. They are the perfect choice
because of their attractive combination
of benefits:
G Extended service life
SKF extreme temperature bearings
are designed to give extended service
lives with a minimum of maintenance. SKF is the only bearing manufacturer using graphite cage technology, thus eliminating the need for any
maintenance or service whatsoever.
G Very wide operating temperature
range
Special lubricants make it possible
to use some of the bearings down to
–150 °C and up to a maximum operating temperature of +350 °C.

Comprehensive, unrivalled range
dangerous gases or vapours are 
emitted.
2. 2Z/VA208 design – for high
demands
These bearings differ from the VA228
design only in their cage. Instead of the
coronet cage, they have a segmented
cage of graphite. The segments separate the balls and also provide the necessary lubrication. The bearings are 
fitted with two shields which axially
guide the cage segments and prevent
the entry of solid contaminants. Because of the segmented cage, these
bearings are primarily intended for
slowly rotating applications.
3. VA201 design – for the most 
common applications
These bearings are not sealed and
have a pressed steel cage. The radial
internal clearance is four times C5. 
All bearing surfaces are manganese
phosphated. This protects the bearing
from corrosion, enhances running properties and provides good adhesion 
for the lubricant.
The extreme temperature bearings
of the VA201 design are lubricated with
a polyalkylene glycol/graphite mixture
which can be used at temperatures
between −40 and +250 °C. At temperatures above +200 °C, dry lubrication
pertains.
4. 2Z/VA201 design – added 
protection with shields
These bearings are of the same design
as the VA201 bearings but have protective shields at both sides to prevent
the ingress of solid contaminants.
Additionally, these bearings have 
twice the amount of the polyalkylene
glycol/graphite mixture as the open
bearings.
The range of SKF extreme temperature bearings covers deep groove ball
bearings in the 60, 62 and 63 series 
currently in demand, in sizes from 10
to 100 mm bore diameter. Taking availability into account, this constitutes the
most complete range on the market.
All bearings are available with cylindrical bore to suit most types of 
mounting methods. 
SKF extreme temperature bearings
are available in five different final variants:
1. 2Z/VA228 design – for top 
requirements
This bearing variant is the “top-of-theline” among SKF products for extreme
temperatures. It is fitted with the recently developed “coronet” cage of
pure graphite which makes the bearings suitable for new applications. The
cage can support appreciably heavier
loads than the graphite segment cage.
This means that in practice these bearings are suitable for applications where
the operating temperature is in the
range −150 to +350 °C and the speeds
are up to 100 r/min.
The coronet cage is an SKF development and only available in SKF bearings. It not only separates the balls but
also presents a unique lubrication system. The minute quantities of graphite
powder released by the cage during
rotation provide adequate lubrication
for the bearing. The bearing is also
equipped with two shields which prevent particulate contamination from
entering the bearing and also guide
the cage axially.
All surfaces of the bearing, including
the shields, are manganese phosphated
to protect against corrosion and also to
enhance running properties. The radial
internal clearance is four times C5. Another advantage of these bearings is
that they are environmentally friendly.

General rule
The SKF extreme temperature
bearings are primarily intended for
shaft speeds up to approximately
100 r/min. For applications with
higher speeds or different operating conditions, please contact
SKF for advice and support.
5. 2Z/VA216 – for aggressive 
environments 
For bearing arrangements where the
environment is particularly aggressive,
bearings of the 2Z/VA216 design are
recommended. These bearings are
charged with a creamy-white multipurpose grease based on a fluorinated
polyether oil mixed with PTFE for 
operating temperatures from −40 to
+230 °C. Otherwise the bearings have
the same design as 2Z/VA201.
For normal cases, the lubricant fill 
is between 25 and 35 % of the free
space in the bearing. On request 
other filling grades can be supplied
(expressed as % of the free space in
the bearing):
10 to 15 % (suffix A)
45 to 60 % (suffix B)
70 to 100 % (suffix C)

Customized for special
purposes
SKF extreme temperature bearings
are designed for the most common
extreme temperature applications, e.g.
kiln truck wheels, support rollers and
general wheel arangements.
Specific customer requirements are
satisfied by special order bearings.
SKF can supply extreme temperature
bearings which can replace the existing bearing design or which are the
direct result of a joint design cooperation with the customer. SKF has a long
tradition of supplying special feature
bearings for especially demanding
applications.
Y-bearing units for extreme 
temperatures
The SKF product range also includes 
Y-bearing units for operating temperature range −150 to +350 °C. They are
available as
• Y-bearing plummer block units, 
• Y-bearing flanged units with square
housing, and
• Y-bearing flanged units with oval 
housing
Accessories for optimum
performance
The boundary dimensions of the SKF
extreme temperature deep groove ball
bearings of the 60, 62 and 63 series
are in accordance with the ISO Dimension Plan. The bearings of series 62
can be used directly in SKF housings
of TVN design. These housings are
available in five sizes for shafts of 
35 up to 65 mm diameter. In order to
further protect the bearing, a heat 
resistant seal strip made of aluminum
boron silicate can be used to prevent
the ingress of contaminants from the
surrounding environment. For more
information please contact SKF.
The surfaces of the grey cast iron housings are coated with zinc and yellow
chromate; this galvanised layer provides added protection against corrosion and gives the housings a distinctive appearance.
To meet the widely differing engineering demands in this wide temperature
range, two different versions of bearings of series
YAR 2-2FW are
used: VA201 
and VA228.
The range of 
Y-bearing units 
is for shaft diameters of 30 to 60
mm and 3/4
to 2 7/16 in.

SKF extreme temperature bearings
with suffix 2Z/VA208 have a segmented
cage made from special graphite. The
bearing also has two shields which will
protect the bearing from particulate
contamination as well as keep the
graphite powder inside the bearing.
Powdered graphite is slowly transferred from the cage segments to the
bearing surfaces ensuring constant
lubrication and long service life. No
maintenance is required.
SKF extreme temperature bearings
of the 2Z/VA228 design represent the
latest development. They are fitted
with a one-piece graphite cage instead
of the segmented cage. Tests, both at
low and high speeds (up to the maximum recommended) have shown extremely little wear. The service life has
been appreciably extended as the cage
has an optimum fit round the balls and
thus has a low specific load. The design has very high performance and
offers the longest service lives of all
the present extreme temperature
designs.
The design makes all the
difference
Design features
The various designs of SKF extreme
temperature bearings are made with
the customers needs and requirements in mind
G Extended service life 
G Different lubrication systems 
G Customised designs
G Different seal arrangements
G Operational cost savings
The philosophy behind SKF extreme
temperature bearings is based on continuous development aiming at rugged
and reliable bearings which can be
used even in the most demanding
applications. SKF extreme temperature
bearings can often be used instead of
expensive special bearings or intricate,
extremely costly lubricants offered on
the market. 
The SKF extreme temperature 
bearings with the suffix VA201 offer the
customer extended service life since
the amount of lubricating paste is large,
thus ensuring a good supply and an
adequate reservoir of lubricant. When
the bearing is fitted with two protective
shields, 2Z/VA201, the amount of lubricant is even larger. This together with
the shields will further prolong the service life. The shields also serve to
retain the lubricant inside the bearing.

can be found in many other industries
where bearings are subjected to
extreme temperatures.
One of the main reasons for SKF’s
dominant market position for extreme
temperature bearings is the customers’
ever increasing awareness about what
bearing quality means to their machine
life cycle cost.
How to decrease life-cycle costs
Application examples
Long service life, high reliability and
minimal maintenance requirements
have made SKF extreme temperature
deep groove ball bearings the obvious
choice in all industrial segments where
temperatures are very high or very low
and speeds low and where high running accuracy is not required. The key
segments with their typical requirements are listed below, but applications
Application examples
Foil calenders
The calenders were originally fitted with
bearings which required frequent relubrication with expensive high temperature
grease. Three have now been converted to SKF deep groove ball bearings 
of the VA228 design which require no
maintenance. As a result, maintenance
costs have been reduced by more than
1,2 million SEK per annum. In addition,
the foil produced is much cleaner (no
lubricant leakage to soil it).
Kiln trucks
The wheels are fitted with SKF deep
groove ball bearings of the 2Z/VA208
design. Normal operating temperature
is +200 to +230 °C. The original bearing design lasted between 3 months
and one year but with the 2Z/VA208
design the service life could be extended to more than 4 years. Service lives
of up to more than 12 years have been
recorded in other similar applications.
This means much lower bearing costs
and also no wheel repairs were
required.

Wafer biscuits baking oven
The traditional wheel bearing design
used standard deep grove ball bearings lubricated with a very expensive
high temperature grease. The operating conditions with temperatures up 
to +240 °C warranted relubrication at
regular intevals and frequent bearing
replacement due to clogged/dried out
grease plus corrosion. The normal service life was around 2 years. Extreme
temperature bearings 2Z/VA208 were
installed instead allowing a four-year
period of maintenance-free operation.
Chain grate furnace
2 500 special SKF support rollers
based on double row deep groove ball
bearings fitted with graphite segment
cages, design VA208, are used per 
furnace at operating temperatures up
to +350 °C.
The original design wore out rapidly
and increased the running friction dramatically. All rollers had to be changed
within a year. The new SKF support
rollers kept a very low coefficient of
friction and lasted up to 4 years without
maintenance.

The rollers operate at about +350 °C
and carry the material to be heat treated. During a refit the original bearings,
which had a service life of approximately 3 to 6 months, were replaced
by SKF deep groove ball bearings of
the 2Z/VA208 design, thus extending
the service life to more than 7 years.
Overall operating costs have been
considerably reduced as a result and it
has also been possible to dispense
with the original water cooling of the
housings.

Calculation
bearing can be selected from the bearing tables (from page 16 onwards). 
If the requisite basic static load rating
lies between two values in the bearing
table the bearing with the higher rating
should be chosen.
Selection of bearing size for kiln
truck wheels
Bearing size is selected on the basis 
of the basic static load rating as kiln
trucks operate at very slow speeds.
For free wheels with two bearings of
equal size (➔ fig
, page 13) the requisite basic static load rating for one
bearing is obtained from the equation
G0
C0 = 1,5 ––
fT
where
C0 = requisite basic static load rating
of a single bearing, N
G0 = radial load acting on one wheel, N
fT = temperature factor (➔ table
)
Table 
applies to arrangements comprising two bearings of the same size
mounted symmetrically with respect to
the plane of the load and gives the requisite basic static load rating depending on wheel load and temperature,
calculated using the above equation,
for one bearing.
For a free-wheel arrangement with
bearings of different size (➔ fig
,
page 13) the requisite value of C0 for
the inboard (tyre rim) side is obtained
from
G0
C0 = 2 ––
fT

Influence of operating temperature
At high temperatures, the load carrying
capacity of the bearings is reduced.
This is taken into consideration by 
multiplying the basic static load rating
C0 by a temperature factor fT. Values 
of this factor at different temperatures
will be found in table
.
Selection of bearing size based on
the static load rating
The size of bearing required for a given
application is selected with reference
to the loads which are to be expected
and the load carrying capacity of the
bearing. Bearings for extreme temperatures rotate at very slow speeds.
Therefore, the requisite size is determined based on the basic static load
rating C0. The requisite basic static
load rating can be determined using
P0
C0 = 2 ––
fT
where
C0 = requisite basic static load rating 
of the bearing, N
P0 = equivalent static bearing load, N
fT = temperature factor (➔table
)
The equivalent static bearing load is
obtained from
P0 = 0,6 Fr + 0,5 Fa
where
P0 = equivalent static bearing load, N
Fr = actual radial bearing load, N
Fa = actual axial bearing load, N
When calculating P0, the maximum
load which can occur should be used
and its radial and axial components
inserted in the equation above. If 
P0 < Fr, then P0 = Fr should be used.
Using the requisite basic static load
rating calculated from above, a suitable
and for the outboard (cover) side, from
G0
C0 = ––
fT
The requisite basic static load rating of
bearings in axleboxes inside or outside
the wheel (➔ fig
, page 13) is obtained using the equation
G0
C0 = 2 ––
fT
Using the values of the requisite basic
static load rating C0 calculated using
the above equations, or obtained from
table
, suitable bearings of series
60, 62 or 63 can be selected from the
bearing tables (from page 16 onwards).
If the requisite basic static load rating lies between two values in the
bearing table, the bearing with the
higher load rating should always be
chosen. The diameter of the journal
must always be checked with regard to
its strength.

for a deep groove ball bearing for free

Calculation example
A kiln truck has four wheels of the free
wheel type, i.e. the axle does not
rotate. Each wheel has two bearings 
of the same size.
Operating conditions:
Speed: Intermittent, approximately 
2 r/min 
Load per wheel: 15 000 N
Temperature: 250 °C
The requisite load rating C0 is obtained
from
G0
C0 = 1,5 ––

so that
C0 = 1,5 × 15 000/0,9
C0 = 25 000 N
Thus a bearing having a basic static
load rating C0 of at least 25 000 N 
is required, for example, bearing 
6211-2Z/VA208, which has a C0 value
= 29 000 N.

To avoid excessive tilting forces
which can occur, for example, if forces
act on the wheel at right angles to the
direction of travel, a ratio of 4:1 is recommended for the wheel diameter D
to the distance between bearings a 
(➔ fig
). The free-wheel design incorporating two bearings of equal size
(➔ fig
) is generally used for kiln
trucks with wheel loads of up to 30 kN.
For heavier loads and wide gauge track
a design with bearings of different size
should be used, as the inboard bearing
is more heavily loaded than that at the
outboard position (➔ fig
).
In addition to the free-wheel arrangement, kiln trucks are also fitted with
axleboxes either inside or outside the
wheel (➔ fig
). For both designs
housings are required which can be
bolted to the frame of the kiln truck.
Two bearings are needed for each
wheel set: one locating and one nonlocating. The axleboxes must be care5

Traditionally, the wheel arrangements
of conventional two-axled kiln trucks
(➔ fig
) are usually designed as
free-wheel (independent) arrangements. Two deep groove ball bearings
are mounted directly on the journal.
This design permits simple mounting
and dismounting as well as easy inspection of the bearings. Deformation
of the axle or bogie under load or as a
result of temperature changes will not
have a detrimental effect on bearing
performance. The hub bore is sealed
at the outboard position by a cover 
and at the inboard position by a seal.
Labyrinth seals have proved to be the
most suitable; felt seals are unable to
withstand the high temperatures. The
labyrinth seal must have a relatively
large radial clearance to match the
large internal clearance of the bearing. 
Suitable hub bore and journal tolerances are given in table
.
Kiln truck wheel bearing
arrangement design
fully mounted so that the bearings do
not become preloaded, as this would
make operation difficult and would
cause premature failure. Because of
the changes in axle length which result
from temperature variation, it is necessary to ensure that axial displacement
is possible in both directions, and that
the amount of possible displacement is
equal at both sides of the non-locating
bearing.
SKF TVN housings are suitable as
housings for these wheel bearing arrangements. When mounting outside
the wheel the A type (for shaft ends,
with cover) should be used. The B type
(for through shafts) should be used for
mounting inside the wheel. The standard felt strips of these bearings should
be replaced by special strips (designated FSB ..) of high temperature
material (graphited aluminium boron
silicate). Suitable hub bore and journal
tolerances are given in table

Mounting
The SKF deep groove ball bearings for
extreme temperatures are mounted with
clearance or interference fits on the
shaft and in the housing. A satisfactory
radial location and an adequate support can generally only be obtained
when one of the rings (depending on
loading situation) is mounted with an
appropriate degree of interference 
(➔ “Kiln truck wheel bearing arrangement design”, page 12).
When mounting the bearings, the
ring which is to have the tighter interference fit is generally mounted first.
The force needed to mount a bearing
increases considerably with increasing
bearing size. Therefore, it is not generally possible to press large bearings on
to a cylindrical shaft or into a housing
in the cold state. In this case, depending on whether the interference is
between bearing and shaft or bearing
and housing, the bearing or the housing should be heated before mounting. 
To mount with an interference fit on
a shaft the bearing should be heated to
about 80 to 90 °C above the temperature of the shaft. This can be done by
means of an SKF induction heater or
in a heating cabinet. Mounting bearings by cooling the shaft is not recommended. The risk of condensation
causing corrosion is evident.
Dismounting
The force required to remove a bearing
is generally greater than the mounting
force, particularly if, after a long period
of service, fretting
corrosion is present. If bearings
are to be re-used
after removal, the
force used to dismount them must
The same dry lubricant should also
be applied thinly to all other shiny components of the bearing arrangement to
protect them from corrosion.
on no account be applied through the
rolling elements. 
Extreme temperature bearings can
be removed using mechanical or hydraulic withdrawal tools or a press. 
For detailed information about suitable mounting and dismounting tools,
please refer to the SKF catalogue 
“The Tools for Trouble-Free Operation”.
Maintenance
SKF extreme temperature bearings
are largely maintenance free. The bearings of VA201 design should however
be inspected after some six months of
operation. It is sufficient to open the
housing or to withdraw the wheel with
bearings from the journal and to remove contaminants using bellows.
If pressurised air is used the air
stream should be weak and the air dry.
Other inspection operations are generally only necessary once a year or once
every second year depending on the
operating conditions. If, however, the
bearings do not rotate easily or have
become noisy the bearing arrangement in question should be inspected
immediately. In this case the bearings
must be dismounted and after cleaning
they should be checked to see whether
they are suitable for further use.
If there is no longer a film of dry lubricant on the raceways (indicated by
a bright metallic shiny track) the bearings should be relubricated using the
original lubricant. The lubricant should
be applied to the bearing raceways
and the rings turned so that it is evenly
distributed in the bearing. It should be
remembered that dry lubricants do not
adhere so well to the relatively smooth
raceway surfaces of a used bearing. If
there is damage to the raceways, rolling elements or cage or if there are
signs of wear or corrosion it is safer to
replace the bearings. 
Please consult 
the SKF catalogue “The Tools
for Trouble-Free
Operation”.

Dimensions
The boundary dimensions of SKF deep
groove ball bearings for extreme temperatures are in accordance with those
of the Dimension Series 10, 02 and 03
as specified in ISO 15:1998.
Tolerances
The deep groove ball bearings for extreme temperatures are produced with
normal tolerances to ISO 492:1994.
Because of the special surface treatment which they undergo to protect
against corrosion and enhance running
properties there may be some slight
deviations from the tolerances specified in the above standard. However,
this has no influence on their arrangement or performance.
Internal clearance
The SKF deep groove ball bearings for
extreme temperatures are produced
with extra large radial internal clearance. The actual values are given in
the bearing tables on pages 16 to 21.
The clearance corresponds to about
four times the standardised C5 clearance (4 × C5).
Misalignment
Because of the large clearance, these
special deep groove ball bearings can
tolerate angular misalignments of the
inner ring relative to the outer ring of
between 20 and 30 minutes of arc.
This is only applicable when the bearings operate at low speeds as the rolling conditions in the bearings are unfavourable under such misalignment.
Speeds
SKF deep groove ball bearings for
extreme temperatures were developed
for bearing arrangements where they
would rotate slowly, i.e. a few revolutions per minute. Our experience is,
however, that it is possible to run the
bearings at speeds up to 100 r/min. It
is advisable to contact SKF application
engineering service if the bearings are
to be used at higher speeds than those
for which they were designed.
Design of associated components
It is advisable to provide some support
to the shields of bearings of the
2Z/VA228 and 2Z/VA208 designs,
because of the nature of the graphite
cage. Therefore it is recommended that
the housing shoulder should have a
diameter which is approximately equal
to or slightly smaller than dimension D2
(➔bearing tables).
If this is not possible then a loose
washer having such a bore diameter
should be positioned between the
bearing and the housing shoulder 
(➔ fig
).
For all other bearing designs the
shoulder should have a bore diameter
not greater than Da max.
Enquiries
When enquiring about the bearings 
for extreme temperatures it is recommended that, in addition to the number
of bearings required, details regarding
the application and operating conditions be given, for example:
1. Operating temperature
2. Bearing or wheel load
3. Speed
4. Shaft diameter
5. Wheel diameter
6. Axlebox design
7. Type of service, e.g. pottery kiln
8. Special conditions, e.g. very dusty
environment

The SKF group 
– a worldwide corporation
SKF is an international industrial Group
operating in some 130 countries and is
world leader in bearings.
The company was founded in 1907
following the invention of the self-aligning ball bearing by Sven Wingquist and,
after only a few years, SKF began to
expand all over the world.

The SKF Engineering & Research Centre 
is situated just outside Utrecht in The
Netherlands. In an area of 17 000 square
metres (185 000 sq.ft) some 150 scientists,
engineers and support staff are engaged in
the further improvement of bearing performance. They are developing technologies
aimed at achieving better materials, better
designs, better lubricants and better seals 
– together leading to an even better understanding of the operation of a bearing in its
application. This is also where the SKF Life
Theory was evolved, enabling the design 
of bearings which are even more compact
and offer even longer operational life.
The SKF Group is the first major bearing
manufacturer to have been granted approval
according to ISO 14001, the international
standard for environmental management
systems. The certificate is the most comprehensive of its kind and covers more than
60 SKF production units in 17 countries.
SKF has developed the Channel concept in
factories all over the world. This drastically
reduces the lead time from raw material to
end product as well as work in progress 
and finished goods in stock. The concept
enables faster and smoother information
flow, eliminates bottlenecks and bypasses
unnecessary steps in production. The
Channel team members have the knowledge and commitment needed to share the
responsibility for fulfilling objectives in areas
such as quality, delivery time, production
flow etc.
SKF manufactures ball bearings, roller 
bearings and plain bearings. The smallest
are just a few millimetres (a fraction of an
inch) in diameter, the largest several metres.
SKF also manufactures bearing and oil
seals which prevent dirt from entering 
and lubricant from leaking out. SKF’s 
subsidiaries CR and RFT S.p.A. are among
the world’s largest producers of seals.
