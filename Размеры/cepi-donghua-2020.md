The Donghua drive chain program
All Donghua British Standard (BS) and Donghua American Standard (ANSI) fulfil and 
perform according the International ISO606 DIN8187 and DIN8188 standard. These 
drive roller chains are designed and developed to meet the International requirements by 
Original Equipment Manufacturers and fulfil the expectations in the Maintenance Repair 
and Overhaul companies. The unique Quality Price performance, the wear resistance, 
fatigue resistance and average breaking load which is +25% above the norm, offer our 
clients a durable and reliable transmission component.
This Donghua Standard Range is used in a very wide range of applications in different 
machines and industries. Besides the pure transmission function, the use of standard 
rollers chains is changing more and more to the materials handling equipment for 
conveying applications. Therefore our seamless rollers and the optimum crushing 
strength of our rollers offer a long-lasting and secure performance in all kinds of 
conveying applications. Another application is for linear motion. Our standard roller 
chains can be used as a gear-rack in different linear applications. Donghua Standard 
and Special roller chains are also used for chain couplings with and without housings.
Despite the fact that all our Standard roller chains are pre-lubricated, maintenance 
lubrication is recommend. There is however one exception, because all our Donghua 
Stainless Steel roller chains are not pre-lubricated. Please let us know which kind of 
lubrication you require. We can offer food grade, high temperature or low temperature 
lubrication.

This Donghua X3 Roller Chain Range is the state of the art of our chain manufacturing 
industry. Designed and developed according the latest available technology, it combines 
extreme precision, fatigue resistance and minimum 3 times longer life time than all 
other brands with their standards to achieve best available wear resistance.
Our engineers succeeded in reducing the coefficient of friction between the roller 
chain pin and bush significantly.. In combination with new hardening technology and 
high sophisticated pre-lubrication, Donghua X3 roller chains are capable of offering 
outstanding performance in the most tough and harsh environments.

The superior quality, durability and outstanding wear and fatigue resistance are realized by an O-ring design between inner and outer plates, solid bushes and solid rollers and 
special highly sophisticated long lasting lubricant. The O-rings and/or X-rings keep the dust and pollution outside the pin/bush area and the long lasting lubricant inside the pin/
bush area. All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are manufactured 
according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete traceability. 
All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging size is 
5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material analyses 
are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length 
tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants are 
available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive 
chain calculation data sheet on page 301. By filling this data sheet and sending this to our engineering department you will receive a detailed drive chain calculation including life 
time expectation. Sprockets are available for all roller chains, with pilot bore, fixed bore, keyway, setscrew or bearing bore with grooves. Standard toothing, hardened toothing or 
special toothing are possible with pilot bore, fixed bore or taper bush. Chain tools, tensioners and chain lubricants please see page 302-310.

wear resistance performance is realized. Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains meet the high requirements in the Food industry. For special food applications there are different 
food grade lubricants available. Please ask our engineering department. Donghua Stainless Steel Roller Chains cannot replace standard carbon steel roller chains in the same 
size. Breaking Load and Wear Resistance differ too much. Please ask our engineering department for the right dimensional choice per drive. All Donghua roller chains are: Preloaded, Fatigue resistant and Wear resistant.  Pre-lubricated is possible on request. By default these stainless steel roller chains are not lubricated! Donghua simplex, duplex and 
triplex roller chains are manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8187, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubrication on request, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production 
batch code number for complete traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety 
instructions. Standard packaging size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length 
tolerance and material analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 
1/2DIN and 1/3DIN length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of 
special lubricants are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department,

The Donghua SP Series dimensions are identical to those of the standard ANSI Series roller chains. The special design of the SP Series link plate delivers exceptional 
performance. The pitch holes are critically formed and ball drifted and the pins are through-hardened for greater shock resistance (25% to 30%). SP Series roller chains offer 
10% higher tensile strength than the equivalent size standard ANSI Series roller chain. The Donghua SP Series can be used to replace the next larger pitch size of standard 
ANSI Series, making them ideal for applications where chain space is limited. Best suited for low speed operating conditions - up to 50 m/min.  All Donghua roller chains are:

The Donghua HSP Series. The thickness of the link plates is the same as the H & HV Series roller chains. The special pin material is also through-hardened which provides a 
higher tensile strength and a higher shock load resistance than SP Series roller chains. The pitch holes are critically formed and ball drifted. HSP Series roller chain can be 
used to replace the next larger size of ANSI standard roller chain, making them ideal for applications where space is limited. Best suited for low speed operating conditions 
- up to 50 m/min.  All Donghua roller chains are: Pre-loaded, Fatigue resistant, Wear resistant and Pre-lubricated. Donghua simplex, duplex and triplex roller chains are 
manufactured according to ISO 606 DIN8188, standard pre-loaded, pre-lubricated, do have seamless rollers and are marked with production batch code number for complete 
traceability. All Donghua roller chains are sealed in plastic bags and packed in cardboard boxes with clear ISO 606 DIN descriptions and safety instructions. Standard packaging 
size is 5 meter box, reels are available on request. Cut to length service is available on request. Several test certificates like breaking load, length tolerance and material 
analyses are possible and available on request. Rollers chains which are needed for ‘run as pairs’ applications can be matched as pairs on request. DIN, 1/2DIN and 1/3DIN 
length tolerance are possible, please ask us for a quotation. For high temperature, low temperature, food application or special environments different kind of special lubricants 
are available. Please ask our sales team for any special needs. For drive chain calculation and right dimension check, please contact our engineering department, also see drive

Wear gauge
Wear gauge

1. From chain type select pitch (P) of chain (example 16B => 1” pitch) 
2. Select from required pitch, pos. A, B or 1 ¾”  (example 1” pitch = A and 5/8” pitch is B, for 1 ¾” pitch there is a separate position) 
3. Position the wear scale with the required pitch position A, B or 1 ¾”  to the center of the pin head 
4. When the selected pitch, pos. A, B or 1 ¾”  appear opposite to the center of the pin head, the chain is worn out (3%  wear)

Mounting tensioners
Tensioning Chains
These tools are used to tension chains for chain assembling. Due to a mechanical system a threaded axis will create 
translation by rotation. This translation will bring two ends of a chain together. This will make room for the connection link.
The use of a compression spring will give the user more stability.
