1. BASIC STRUCTURE OF FBJ PILLOW BLOCKS
1.1. 
FBJ Bearing units
The FBJ range of bearing units offer a wide choice of Cast Iron, Pressed Steel or Thermo – Plastic
housings fitted with the full, range of bearing inserts, with spherical outer diameter and some with cylindrical
outer diameter.
The general housing types are Pillow blocks, Flange units, Hanger Units, Cartridge units and TakeUp units. Choice is very much determined by the requirements of the application, although the aesthetic
appearance of the machine design is often an important consideration. Self-Lube units have been designed
to meet the needs of both criteria.
The castings are made from high-quality Gray cast iron (JIS, G5501) and finished on all un-machined
surfaces with standard dimensions. Pressed steel housings are made from mild steel strips (JIS, 3141)
and are zinc plated. In corrosive environment and Food industry, it is recommended to use Thermo –
Plastic housings (VALOX 420) with Stainless Steel Bearing inserts.
1.2 
FBJ Bearing inserts
The FBJ bearing insert, commonly known as a wide inner ring bearings, is designed to suit the wide
range, of housings. FBJ bearing inserts also suitable for applications where the users own housing is
preferred.
Bearing inserts are basically deep-groove ball bearings to the internationally popular 6, series
configuration with integral design features making them more functional and versatile than the standard
ball bearing. They are offered with either parallel or spherical outside diameter outer rings with the latter
being the type fitted as standard in the bearing unit.
The integral design features of the bearing insert are such as shaft locking, seals and
re-lubrication.
The inner rubber seals are firmly assembled on the outer ring and ensure perfect sealing of grease
chamber. The steel shield or slingers rotate with inner ring and generate centrifugal force, by means of
which dust is efficiently excluded.
FBJ offer two types of material for bearing insert, High Carbon Chromium Bearing Steel and Stainless
Steel.

3. LUBRICATION, CLEARANCE AND SPEED LIMITS
OF FBJ PILLOW BLOCKS
3.1 
BEARING LUBRICATION
Bearing lubrication reduces friction and wear, acts as a coolant, minimizes contamination, prevents
corrosion, and generally extends bearing life. Selecting the best lubricant for your specific application
becomes a very important decision; however, choosing from the hundreds available lubricants can be
an overwhelming task. FBJ engineering staff is available to help make the right decision for your
application.
FBJ bearing Inserts with pressed steel housings are for life lubrication and filled with high quality
multipurpose grease, with the correct quantity. These bearings cannot be re-lubricate.
Bearing Inserts with Cast iron housings or Thermo Plastic housings are equipped with a grease
nipple and also filled with high quality multipurpose grease and with the correct quantity. These bearings
are to be re-lubricate after the recommended hours of initial operation, to ensure a long life and smooth
running.
It is important to use the correct grease with correct amount in the correct replenishment period.
Following tables will help you to decide the both factors, the replenishment period and re-fill quantity.

4. BEARING LIFE OF FBJ PILLOW BLOCK UNITS
Any bearing, even operating under normal conditions, the surfaces of the raceway and rolling
elements are constantly being subjected to repeated compressive stresses which cause flaking of these
surfaces to occur. This flaking is due to material fatigue and will eventually cause the bearings to fail.
When bearing is stationary, still the rolling elements are subjected to static loads. This leads to
a plastic total deformation of rolling element and raceway of about 0.0001 of the rolling element diameter
at the most heavily loaded contact area.
The life of bearing is regarded as expired when the revolution fatigue is produced on the rolling
face of bearing. In reference with this life, the Load rating is defined where the load is applied under
certain conditions.
The life of each bearing is defined as the total number of revolution until the first flaking mark due
to fatigue appears. When the number of rotation is constant, it is shown by the total time until the first
flaking mark appears. Even if same type of bearings of excellent materials with same design and finished
by the same heat treatment and manufacturing processes are driven under the same conditions, the
lives of bearings scatter to some extent due to uncontrollable differences in them. Therefore, it is not
adequate to use the mean life as the standard life of bearings.
The rated Life is defined here as the total number of rotations or time of driving after which 90%
of the bearings of a group under test remains without fatigue.
The basic load rating is the pure radial load of constant direction and magnitude which gives the
rated life of 106rotations when the outer ring is fixed and the inner ring is rotated. There exists the following
relationship between the basic load rating and the life.
Where, Ln : rated life in total number of rotations which unit is 106 rotations.
(When Ln = 3, it means 3 million rotations.)
C : basic load rating [ kgf ]
K : coefficient(3 for ball bearing and  10  for roller bearing)
P : load (equivalent radial load) [ kgf ]
When the bearings are installed to an apparatus rotating at a constant number
of rotation, the lives are mostly estimated by driving hours, and the following
equation which is modified by the above equation is used.
where Lh: rated life time in total rotating time, [ hour ]
n : speed of rotation, [ r.p.m. ]
The above equation can be modified to give an equation which is convenient
to actual designing
where, fh :
life factor
fn :
speed factor
Please refer to the nomogram at the right hand, which shows the values of n:fn and
Lh:fh for the ball bearing.

5. ALLOWABLE LOAD FOR FBJ HOUSINGS
It is important, not only the dynamic and static load capacity of a bearing insert, but also to consider
destruction strength of the hosing, before you select the correct bearing for your application.
FBJ has done extensive research on this and present below tables to ease your problems. Please
note that, allowable load varies depending on load direction and type of the housing.

6.  MOUNTING OF FBJ PILLOW BLOCK UNITS
6.1.2 Eccentric Lock Collar Method
Here, an eccentric diameter formed on the
extended inner ring of the bearing which engages
a similarly formed eccentric diameter in the bore
of a separate collar.
Locking is achieved by turning the collar in
the direction of shaft rotation until the eccentric
diameters of both collar and inner ring are fully
engaged. The collar is provided with a blind hole
to facilitate tightening when locking the bearing
to the shaft. The set screw when tightened to the
recommended torque values prevents the collar
backing off in service.

TIGHTENING TORQUE FOR SET SCREW

Fig 6.1.1
6.1.1 Set Screw Method
Two knurled cup-point, self locking, sockethead set screws (Fig 6.1) fitted at 120º apart in
the extended inner ring of the bearing insert.
For standard loads and moderate speeds
simply mount the bearing unit into position and
tighten down the set screw to the recommended
torque value. Additional security can be achieved
by spot drilling the shaft to accommodate the set
screw point. Using the correct size of socket head
wrench tightens the set screw to recommended
torque.
A lock washer is provided which prevents
the locknut backing off when one of the tabs is
engaged with the corresponding notch in the
locknut.

6.3
Mounting of Housing
To prevent any damage to the insert bearing due to faulty installation, Housing unit should always
be bolted to a base which is to be flat and rigid. The bearing center alignment angle of +3º is required
for the mounting base. In case of bearing unit with cover, this angle is restricted to +1º.
6.1.3 Adapter Sleeve Method
This consists of a standard adapter sleeve,
locknut and lock washer.
When fitting the bearing to the shaft, care
must be taken to ensure that the locknut is not
over tightened as this can reduce or eliminate the
required bearing internal clearance, resulting in
premature failure.
The proper tightening condition can be
obtained, firstly tightening the locknut by hand
and then rotating 2/5 to 3/5 revolutions by a
spanner.
A lock washer is provided which prevents
the lock nut backing off when one of the tabs is
engaged with the corresponding notch in the
locknut.

Shaft Selection
Standard mounting of cylindrical bore insert bearing to the shaft is loose fit. Still, selection of shaft
has to consider the speed of the insert bearing. Below table provide you the dimensional accuracy of your
shaft to be made for loose fit, in order to facilitate you smooth running.
