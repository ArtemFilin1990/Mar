PET Shock Absorbers
1
ACE Controls now offers a NEW GENERATION of 
industrial shock absorbers for the PET container 
industry. These durable models are ideally suited for 
stretch rod and mold applications on Sidel and Krones 
production machines.
This versatile line of ACE PET shock absorbers 
includes the dual benefits of soft contact and selfcompensating performance, allowing for reaction to 
changing conditions without adjustment. In addition, the 
effective weight is now configurable, adding even more 
application capability to these rugged performers.
PET shock absorbers from ACE include H1 food grade 
oil, USDA, FDA, and NSF approved. Numerous models 
now include a rear female hex design for ease and 
speed of installation.
ACE PET shock absorbers allow production machinery 
to run faster and longer with considerably reduced 
reaction forces, reduced component wear and reduced 
downtime.

The application image on the left shows the mold in 
the closed and locked position. In this application, the 
shock absorber is mainly used as a snubber.
The shock tightens any slack in the mechanical 
linkages and prevents the mold halves from hammering 
each other.
Machines have a carousel style rotating base.
They can have from 4 to 48 Mold stations.
The mold accepts a heated PET preform, closes 
and engages a shock.
The stretch rod stretches the preform and then 
strikes the shock at end of stroke.
After the bottle has been sized, the stretch rod 
is then retracted. On some machines there is a 
shock for the up direction.
Mold opens and the bottle is ejected
Shock applications are the mold close, stretch 
rod down and stretch rod up positions on some 
machines
