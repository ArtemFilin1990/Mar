TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Matrix® EP is highly recommended for difficult applications such as
extreme pressure, water, heat, or chemical attack.
The thickener system in Matrix® EP has a protective effect similar
to that of molybdenum disulfide, protecting equipment from wear
under difficult conditions of extreme load.
Matrix® EP helps neutralize acids and also resists reacting with
caustic materials. Matrix® EP grease has prevented corrosion
despite years of exposure to phosphoric acid.
Matrix® EP 1 can be pumped in central lubrication systems at
temperatures down to 23°F (-10°C).
Matrix® EP 2 is suitable for use in Caterpillar equipment under the
category of "Water and Temperafure Resistant Grease".
The TK grades are designed for slow moving bearings under the
most extreme load. These grades are also more tacky and more
resistant to water.

NEWS
2006


DET 900 EP 2 is a stable, nonflammable, chemically inert grease designed for use in
long life and sealed- for- life applications.
It is inert to virtually all chemicals used in industry, is insoluble in most solvents,
and relatively stable to radiation when compared to conventional lubricants.
This product is biologically inert and offers superior resistance to
"Lewis acids," found in semiconductor manufacturing.
DET 900 EP 2 will prove serviceable for long periods at continuous temperatures up to 400°F (204°C)
with minimal re- lubrication. DET 900 EP 2 can withstand higher temperatures (up to 575°F or 300°C).
At 575°F re- lubrication is needed approximately every 8 to 12 hours.
Ensure adequate ventilation when used at or above 535°F (280°C)
Compatibility with elastomeric seal materials and plastics is
excellent. This includes Buna N, Butyl 325, Neoprene, Nylon and
Teflon. The limiting factor when using this grease is the thermal
stability of the elastomer or plastic.

BECO CATALOGUE 2010, BEARINGS FOR EXTREME TEMPERATURES
We have the pleasure of introducing you to our new 2010 catalogue, which, in the Beco 
tradition, presents several innovations and improvements over the previous edition;  
especially after the success of the first production, it  has an increased  number of 
available products with Viton seals for 250° 280°.
We have increased the range of bearings with graphite cage, now making the application 
available also on the self aligning supports.
We introduce a new  full ball range of bearings for 400°, able to operate, even if with 
limitations on duration of time, at considerable higher temperatures.
Our range of low temperature bearings, down to -50°,  which was previously  produced 
only upon customer request, has become  standard and ready from stock.
Regarding the range of stainless steel bearings, rises a new range produced in AISI 630 
able to obtain results of complete rustproof and load resistance, which in the past were 
not able to conjugate.
Regarding the production of industrial components, the steel wheel production for 
extreme temperatures, which in the past were produced only upon customer drawings, 
become standard.
For the industrial components range, we have expanded the information and 
descriptions  in order  for our distributors to better  use them and to identify the 
potential customers.

Ball bearings for high temperatures
BHT 2RS 150°
   The bearings BHT 2RS for 150° are developed on the base of a standard structure but with 
special stabilization treatment, radial clearance, greases and special plates which make them 
suitable to operate from -30 to +150°.
   Their application range is extremely wide and covers almost all the areas of application, 
particularly the bearing in BHT 2RS 150° allows a wide range of safety in all applications where 
it can also occur temporarily and for reason not dependent on the will of the designer, 
occasional phenomenal of overheating.
   The current trend of globalization of supply, often creates situations of application of products 
not predictable and not calculable; the bearing BHT 2RS 150° allows additional security at very 
low cost.

BHTS  2RS VT 200°
   The bearings BHTS 2RS VT 200° are designed based on the dimensions of a standard 
bearing but with appropriate treatment of stabilization, radial clearance, greases and special 
Viton plates which make them suitable to operate from 30 to 200°.
   Their application range is extremely wide and covers almost all areas of application, 
particularly the bearing in BHT 2RS VT 200° allows a wide range of safety in all applications 
where it can also occur temporarily and for reason not dependent on the will of the designer, 
occasional phenomenal of overheating.
   The current trend of globalization of supply, often creates situations of application of products 
not predictable and not calculable; the bearing BHT 2RS VT 200° allows total security, 
impossible with standard products.
   The Viton seals in which these bearings are equipped with are suitable for much higher 
temperatures to a point of 280°, but the overall structure of the bearing can be safely used up to 
200°.
   Even though the bearing BHTS 2RS VT 200° is designed exclusively for applications in high 
temperatures, the Viton characteristics make it resistant to many types of acids. With regards to 
special applications in the presences of acid, consult the catalogue on stainless steel bearings.
For needs relating to problems of acids added to temperature problems, there are high 
temperature stainless steel bearings available with Viton seals.

BHTS ZZ 200°
   The BHTS ZZ 200° ball bearings are developed based on the structure of a standard  bearing  
but with appropriate treatment of stabilization, radial clearance, greases and ZZ shields which 
make them suitable for operation from -30° to +200°. Their application range is extremely wide 
and covers almost all areas of application, in particular, the BHTS ZZ 200 ° bearings allow a 
unique range of safety in all applications where they can also occur temporarily and for reasons 
not dependent on the will of the designer phenomena occasional overheating.
   The current trend of globalization of supply often creates situations of application of products 
not predictable and not calculable; the BHTSZZ 200° bearing allows total security impossible 
with standard products and allows for safe use up to 200° degrees. The BHTS ZZ 200° is 
exactly identical to BHTS 2RS VT 200°, with the only difference of having the ZZ shields which 
allows a  considerable cost savings compared to sheet steel with Viton seal.

BHTS 2RS VT 250°-280°
   The BHTS 2RS VT 250° - 280° ball bearings are designed on the dimensions of a standard  
bearing  but with treatments of stabilisation, surface treatment, radial clearance, greases and 
special Viton seals which make them suitable for operation from -30° to between +250° and 
+280°. Their recommended range of application is between 180° and 250°. The dual display of 
250° - 280° was designed to clearly indicate that the bearing is effectively a bearing for 280 °, but 
the Viton seals have a reduction of duration in excess of 250° for which the bearing achieves its 
best performance in the above-mentioned, range of 180° to 250°. Below 200°, there are the 
BHTS 2RS VT 200° available, which are cheaper and also allow a much higher rotational 
speed. The range of the 2RS VT 250° - 280° is replacing the BHTS ZZ 280°, which present the 
same functional, structural characteristics but with levels of protection against weather 
conditions significantly lower. The Viton characteristics are ideal in resisting many types of 
acids, however, the BHTS 2RS VT 250° - 280°, is designed exclusively for applications in high 
temperatures. With regards to applications in the presence of acid, consult the relative section 
of the catalogue on stainless steel bearings. For needs relating to problems of acids added to 
temperature problems, there are high temperature stainless steel bearings available with Viton 
seals.

BHT 320°

   The BHT 320° ball bearings are designed on the dimensions of a standard  bearing  but with 
treatments of stabilisation, surface treatment, radial clearance and molybdenum grease that 
make them suitable for operation from -30° to +320°. Their recommended range of application is 
between 280° and 320°. The BHT 320° bearings are open bearings and require frequent 
additional lubrication with oil for high temperatures. Until the end of the 1980's, greases suitable 
at operating at a temperature in the absence of periodic lubrication were not available, so this 
product was the only solution to working in high temperatures. Such greases are now available, 
capable of operating up to 280° and lubrication with graphite cages for temperature up to 350°. 
Therefore this type of bearings now has a limited range of application in existing industrial 
plants. The lubrication with molybdenum disulphide grease makes the bearing vulnerable to 
oxidation resulting from the weather, so the shelf life is completely depending on the quality of 
maintenance performed. The BHT 320° bearing has been produced for over 30 years and many 
customers have found that with the right balance in maintenance intervals achieve excellent 
results with a product that is objectively economic. Please note that the BHT 320 ° bearing does 
not allow further greasing even with the same molybdenum disulphide grease. Our 30 years of 
experience has allowed us to identify almost exclusively as a cause of damage to the bearing, 
the added grease is incompatible even if of the same quality inside the bearing. The amount of 
grease used in the original design is calculated and this is what is needed to create the film of 
molybdenum on the raceway of the ball, and although visually seems to be a small quantity, is 
technically the optimal amount for operation.

BHTS Z 320°

   The BHTS Z 320° ball bearings are designed on the dimensions of a standard  bearing  but 
with treatments of stabilisation, surface treatment, radial clearance, and molybdenum grease 
that make them suitable for operation from -30° to +320°. Their recommended range of 
application is only between 280° and 320°. The BHTS Z 320° bearings are open on one side 
and protected by sheet steel type Z on the opposite side. They require frequent additional 
lubrication with oil for high temperatures. Until the end of the 1980's, greases suitable at 
operating at a temperature in the absence of periodic lubrication were not available, so this 
product was the only solution to working in high temperatures. Such greases are now available, 
capable of operating up to 280° and lubrication with graphite cages for temperature up to 350°. 
Therefore this type of bearings now has a limited range of application in existing industrial 
plants. The lubrication with molybdenum disulphide grease makes the bearing vulnerable to 
oxidation resulting from the weather, so the shelf life is completely depending on the quality of 
maintenance performed. The BHTS Z 320° bearing has been produced for over 20 years and 
many customers have found that with the right balance in maintenance intervals achieve 
excellent results with a product that is objectively economic. Please note that the BHTS Z 320 ° 
bearing does not allow further greasing even with the same molybdenum disulphide grease. Our 
20 years of experience has allowed us to identify almost exclusively as a cause of damage to 
the bearing, the added grease is incompatible even if of the same quality inside the bearing. 
The amount of grease used in the original design is calculated and this is what is needed to 
create the film of molybdenum on the raceway of the ball, and although visually seems to be a 
small quantity, is technically the optimal amount for operation.

BHTS ZZ GR CG 350°
   The GR CG BHTS ZZ 350° ball bearings are designed on the dimensions of a standard  
bearing  but with treatments of stabilisation, surface treatment, radial clearance and a special 
cage made of graphite, which make them suitable for operation from -50 ° to +350°. Their 
recommended range of application is only between 280° and 350°. The main feature of these 
bearings is to work in total absence of any kind of grease because the lubrication is directly from 
the graphite cage, which makes them "green" through lack of operating any type of issue could 
harm environment.

BHT FB 400°
   The BHT FB 400° bearings are designed on the dimensions of a standard  bearing  but with 
treatments of stabilisation, surface treatment, radial clearance and full ball fitting that make them 
suitable for operation from -30° to +400°. Their recommended range of application is between 
280° and 400°. The BHT FB 400° are open bearings and require occasional, additional 
lubrication with an oil for high temperatures. The unique design allows, through a precision 
lateral milling, the complete full ball fitting of the bearing. This technical solution avoids the use 
of steel cage that is normally the weak element of the bearing in the application of high 
temperatures. The greatest number of spheres within the bearing allows for an increase of load 
capacity, especially in high temperature but limits the use at low speed. This product has been 
produced for over 20 years allowing exceptional performance in terms of durability in 
applications more demanding. In particular it's application is recommended where frequent 
changes are present in the direction of rotation of the bearing and with irregular loads.

Ball bearings in stainless steel (non magnetic)
BSS 316
   The BSS 316 bearings are made of stainless steel AISI 316  for all the rotational parts and 
AISI 304 for the protection and the cage. The construction in AISI 316 guarantees excellent 
performance in applications such as, in the presence of extremely aggressive acids, salts, sea 
water, etc. It is recommended, in the engineering stage, to carefully check the load 
characteristics listed in the catalogue as the AISI 316 bearings are without heat treatment, 
thereby providing a high resistance against oxidation but a limited capacity load. The BSS 316 
are completely non-magnetic and therefore usable in application where this feature is required.

Ball bearings in stainless steel (non magnetic)
BSS 316 ZZ
   The BSS 316 ZZ bearings are made of stainless steel AISI 316  for all the rotational parts and 
AISI 304 for the protection and the cage. The construction in AISI 316 guarantees excellent 
performance in applications such as, in the presence of extremely aggressive acids, salts, sea 
water, etc. It is recommended, in the engineering stage, to carefully check the load 
characteristics listed in the catalogue, as the AISI 316 bearings are without heat treatment, 
thereby providing a high resistance against oxidation but a limited capacity load. The BSS 316 
ZZ are completely non-magnetic and therefore usable in application where this feature is 
required. The presence of ZZ protection and suitable grease allow for their direct use in 
applications without additional protection.
Material Stainless Steel AISI 316

Stainless steel sheets type ZZ
Grease: The bearings are supplied greased (-30° to +130°)
