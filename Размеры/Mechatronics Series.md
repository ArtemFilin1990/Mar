For ultimate compactification
The occupied space is not 
increased even when tables are 
layered in X and Y, so further 
miniaturization of the positioning 
mechanism is promoted.

Evolving Positioning Mechanism ④
The surface of capillary lubricating element is always covered 
with the lubrication oil.
Lubrication oil is continuously supplied to the surface of rolling 
elements by surface tension in the contact of capillary 
lubricating element surface and rolling elements.
On the surface of capillary lubricating element with which the 
rolling elements make contact, new lubrication oil is always 
supplied from the other sections.
The lubrication oil is supplied directly to the rolling elements, not to 
the track rail.
When rolling elements make contact with the capillary lubricating 
element integrated with the circulation path of slide unit rolling 
elements, the lubrication oil is supplied to surfaces of rolling 
elements and carried to the loading area through circulation of 
rolling elements.
This results in adequate lubrication oil being properly maintained in 
the loading area and lubrication performance will last for a long time.

Light weight, low proﬁle and compact positioning table using 
high-strength aluminum alloy for its main components with a 
slide table assembled inside a U-shaped bed.
The mass of the entire table is reduced to about 40% of TU 
series. Low cross sectional height (26mm for TE50B, 33mm 
for TE60B, and 46mm for TE86B). Moreover, the structure of 
various sensors directly installable on sensor mounting groove 
of the bed contributes to the miniaturization.
● Table specification is selectable 
     according to your use
There are two types in the shape of slide table: standard and 
with ﬂange. The number of slide tables, motor folding back 
speciﬁcation, ball screw lead, with or without a dust protection 
cover, installation of various sensors can be selected, you can 
select an optimal product for the speciﬁcations of your machine 
and device.
● Excellent cost performance
The excellent cost performance is realized by reducing the 
number of parts, and optimizing the part shapes.

TE50B: 0.17×10-5kg･m2, TE60B: 0.39×10-5kg･m2, TE86B: 0.86×10-5kg･m2
Motor folding back speciﬁcation is available for Precision Positioning Table TE, space can be saved by folding back the 
motor and reducing the overall length of the table. For dimensions of motor folding back speciﬁcation, please refer to 
respective dimension table.
For motor folding back speciﬁcation, assembly should be made by customer since "housing applicable to the speciﬁed 
motor, pulley (on motor side and ball screw side), cover, motor bracket, belt and bolts necessary for assembly" are supplied. 
However, motor mounting bolts should be prepared by customer. The motor attachment can be attached in 4 directions as 
indicated in the following ﬁgure.
There is difference in dimension between where the motor attachment or the motor is lower than the bottom of the bed 
depending on the motor folding back direction. Do the design ensuring that the peripheral components do not interfere and 
that enough allowance is provided according to the approximate values in the dimension table shown in Page Ⅱ̶25 to Ⅱ̶30.

Two slide table speciﬁcation is available for Precision Positioning Table TE. Ball screw nuts are mounted on slide table at the 
motor side, and it can be driven by the motor (driving table). Ball screw nuts are not mounted on slide table at the opposite 
motor side, and it is free condition (driven table).
It is possible to make the structure resistant to moment load by using two slide tables in combination (Table 8). When 
combining slide tables, allow more clearance than "Minimum center distance between two slide tables in close contact" 
described in the dimension table shown in pages Ⅱ̶19 to Ⅱ̶30. (Enlarging the span will shorten the stroke.)

Track rail
● Compact and slim type positioning table 
     with an original U-shaped track rail
Precision Positioning Table TU is a compact and slim type 
positioning table with a slide table assembled inside a 
U-shaped track rail.
Also, by adopting a U-shaped track rail, the rigidity of the track 
rail under moment load and torsion is greatly increased. The 
track rail can be used as a structure beam of the machine and 
equipment. Therefore, freedom of design is expanded for user.
● Slide table with high accuracy and 
     high rigidity in a single structure
The slide table is an integral part of a linear motion rolling guide 
mechanism, in which large diameter steel balls are arranged in 
two rows and make four-point contact with the raceways. High 
accuracy and high rigidity positioning can thus be obtained 
even in applications where ﬂuctuating load or complex load is 
applied.
● The optimal table specification 
     can be selected from a variety of options
The optimal positioning table for each speciﬁc application can 
be conﬁgured easily by only indicating required functions and 
performance from our substantial size variations and a variety 
of options by the identiﬁcation number.

4: Four sensors (limit, pre-origin, and origin), with a sensor rail
9: Without a sensor, with a sensor rail
No symbol : Not treated
: Black chrome surface treatment 1

Black chrome surface treatment is applied on the surfaces of a slide table and 
track rail.
: Black chrome surface treatment 2

  In addition to the black chrome surface treatment 1, this treatment is applied on 
the ball screw shaft and nut.
No symbol : No C-Lube
Q 
: Table with C-Lube
A C-Lube is mounted on the slide table and the end face of a nut of ball screw. The C-Lube is 
a lubrication part with much lubricant oil impregnated in the consecutive porous resin. Sliding 
or moving along a smooth surface with contact on the track rail and the raceway surface of 
the ball screw causes the lubricant oil within the plate to continue to seep on the raceway 
surface, thus reducing the number of hours for maintenance caused by the extension of 
lubrication interval. This is an effective countermeasure for the attrition of grease at the 
location difﬁcult to be lubricated.
・ When specifying Q, for the entry of section 6 , select ground screw (by specifying G) or 
without ball screw (by specifying N).

Application of motor folding back speciﬁcation is shown in Table 3. To specify the motor 
attachment, select it from the list of Table 6.1 and Table 6.2.
・ Motor should be prepared by customer.
・ Please specify motor folding back speciﬁcation and motor attachment applicable to motor for use.
・ If motor inline speciﬁcation with motor attachment is speciﬁed, the main body is shipped with a coupling 
indicated in the Table 7 mounted. However, the ﬁnal position adjustment should be made by customer 
since it is only temporarily ﬁxed. For a product without motor attachment (AT100), no coupling is attached.
・ If motor folding back speciﬁcation with motor attachment is speciﬁed, "housing applicable to the 
speciﬁed motor, pulley (on motor side and ball screw side), cover, motor bracket, belt and bolts 
necessary for assembly" are supplied. Motor mounting bolts should be prepared by customer.

Motor folding back speciﬁcation is available for Precision Positioning Table TU, space can be saved by folding back the 
motor and reducing the overall length of the table. For dimensions of motor folding back speciﬁcation, please refer to 
respective dimension table.
For motor folding back speciﬁcation, assembly should be made by customer since "housing applicable to the speciﬁed 
motor, pulley (on motor side and ball screw side), cover, motor bracket, belt and bolts necessary for assembly" are supplied. 
However, motor mounting bolts should be prepared by customer.
Motor folding back unit can be mounted in 4 directions as indicated in the following ﬁgure.
A bridge cover and bellows are available for Precision Positioning Table TU as a measure for protection against dust.
For the dimensions of table with bellows, please see dimension tables shown in pages of Ⅱ̶89 to Ⅱ̶90.
Two slide table speciﬁcation is available for Precision Positioning Table TU. Ball screw nuts are mounted on slide table at the 
motor side, and it can be driven by the motor (driving table). Ball screw nuts are not mounted on slide table at the opposite 
motor side, and it is free condition (driven table).
It is possible to make the structure resistant to moment load by using two slide tables in combination (Table 11). When 
combining slide tables, allow more clearance than "minimum center distance between two slide tables in close contact" 
described in the dimension table shown in pages Ⅱ̶69 to Ⅱ̶98 (Enlarging the span will shorten the stroke.).

Cleanroom Precision Positioning Table TC
Positioning table of a structure with enhanced sealing property 
inside the table, based on light weight, low proﬁle and 
compact Precision Positioning Table TE. Thanks to optimal 
design of linear motion rolling guide and ball screws, low cross 
sectional height as low as 50mm for TC50EB, 54mm for 
TC60EB and 67mm for TC86EB is realized. Since the sensor 
is designed to be directly mounted into the mounting groove, 
it contributes to space saving.
● Compatible with cleanliness class 3
Press the stainless sheet against the side cover using the resin 
roller within the slide table, securely absorb it with a strong 
magnet sheet and seal the drive parts and slide table guiding 
parts. Dust-generation in proximity is prevented by sucking air 
from an enclosed space and class 3 cleanliness rating based 
on IKO measurement method is realized. Low dust-generation 
grease CGL for clean environment is contained in slide table 
guiding parts and ball screws to suppress dust-generation.
● High corrosion resistance
Anodized high-tension aluminum alloy and stainless steel 
(stainless sheet) are used in main components to ensure 
excellent corrosion resistance.

Micro Precision Positioning Table TM
Angular bearing
Featuring the ultra-small size yet super precision positioning 
capability, this table is best suited to enhancing the accuracy of the 
positioning mechanism of super small device. And, use of stainless 
steel in steel parts allows the table to be used even in a location 
where use of oil and grease should be preferably avoided and under 
the environment that tends to suffer from water scattering.

We can prepare tables of various speciﬁcations such as 
switching table speciﬁcation, lead screw speciﬁcation, and 
stainless steel cover speciﬁcation, in order to meet customer 
needs. For more information, please contact IKO.
This table can respond to various requests!
Best suited for positioning mechanism of super small device!
Example of special specification: Switching table specification
17mm
15mm
Incorporating a Micro Linear Way L of 2mm in rail width in the 
table guiding parts and a miniature ball screw of 2mm in 
diameter in the feeding mechanism, this is an unparalleled 
ultra-small size positioning table with ground ball screw drive 
type.
Combination of high-lead ball screws and high-torque AC 
servomotors enables the table to move at high speed without 
reducing the accuracy.
There are two types in the shape of slide table: standard table 
and long table. As two Micro Linear Way L with two slide units 
are incorporated in parallel into the long table, the table is 
structurally resistant to moment and complex load. The motor 
can be selected from two types of AC servomotor (standard 
type or high torque type) and stepper motor according to your 
use.
Built-in origin, pre-origin, CW limit and CCW limit sensors can 
be indicated without modifying the outside dimensions.

Crossed Roller Way（roller type）
Nano Linear NT is structured with magnet and optical linear encoder scale deployed as a rotator,
and an air-core coil and optical linear encoder scale head deployed as a stator within its compact body. As 
indicated in the right ﬁgure, the coil is subject to horizontal force due to ﬂux that always works in vertical direction
by the magnet and coil yoke, and rotational ﬂux that is generated around the coil by the coil current (Fleming's 
left-hand rule). By switching the coil current to certain direction corresponding to the ﬂux direction, continuous 
thrust force in a certain direction can be obtained and linear motions of the rotator is maintained. Traveling and 
accurate positioning are performed by acceleration control by current amount and feedback by linear encoder.

Nano Linear NT is a moving magnet type linear motor table with extremely low proﬁle.
For guiding parts of the moving table, Linear Way or Crossed Roller Way well-established in the area of miniature linear motion rolling 
guides is used in combination with linear motor and high-resolution linear encoder to realize highly accurate positioning.
Thanks to adoption of high-performance neodymium magnet, large thrust force can be acquired and therefore high-speed and highly 
responsive positioning is possible, despite its very small body. In addition, high cleanliness is realized as the mechanical contact part 
is only the linear motion rolling guide thanks to adoption of a landmark driving method without moving cables.

Performing rigid-connection of two units of NT…V arranged in 
parallel and driving with a single speciﬁc driver enables high 
thrust force and stable attitude accuracy.
● Two-axis parallel operation

[ High thrust pick and place unit ]
NT···XZH is a linear motor drive high thrust pick and place 
unit with compact integral X- and Z- axis, using C-Lube 
Linear Way ML for miniature linear motion rolling guide in 
the table guiding parts. Thanks to adoption of a system to 
drive moving table by using a link mechanism, it realizes 
both higher thrust force of the linear motor and weight 
reduction of the moving parts and reduces tact time. By 
entering a positioning program, you may set ﬂexible 
operation patterns and change strokes according to works 
easily.
Thanks to X- and Z-axis motor 
located on the ﬂat surface and 
adoption of a system to drive 
moving table by using a link 
mechanism, it realizes both 
higher thrust force of the linear 
motor and weight reduction of 
the moving parts and 
signiﬁcantly reduces tact time.
● High thrust and high tact
Though it is multi-axial unit, wiring is easy and higher cleanliness is 
realized by adopting cableless moving magnet system for the 
moving parts.
As with NT…XZ, the track can be veriﬁed from PC by using the 
driver monitoring function.
● Cableless moving parts
● Operation monitoring function
Performing fully-closed loop control by incorporating an optical 
linear encoder in both axes enables high resolution and high 
response.

● NT…V, NT…XZ and NT…XZH do not have a built-in sensor
Return to origin operation in a system conﬁguration using driver ADVA and the system conﬁguration for NT38V is conducted 
by external input. In the return to origin operation, the moving table turns around after contacting the mechanical stopper, 
and then stops at the origin position. Since, however, a limit sensor and a pre-origin sensor can be mounted on NT55V and 
NT80V with a supplemental signal (/SC), the return to origin operation using each sensor is also possible.
Forward / backward direction limit detection in a system conﬁguration using the driver ADVA is performed by driver's software limit function. The stroke range can be set by parameters for driver. In addition, the software limit function is only enabled in position control mode and return to origin must be completed. In case of speed control mode and thrust force 
control mode, mount an external sensor.

● Compact XYθ-table
Using a Linear Way L miniature linear motion rolling guide in the linear motion guiding parts and Crossed Roller Bearing in the rotation guiding 
parts respectively and adopting direct drive method in the drive section, this is an alignment stage for achieving low proﬁle and compact XYθ 
motion.
● Flexible combination of XYθ
X-table for linear movement and θ-table serving as rotary 
positioning section are listed on lineup as basic conﬁguration. 
Combination of X-axis and θ-axis and alignment table for 
XY-axis can be easily conﬁgured.
● High resolution and high responsiveness
Performing full-closed loop control of direct drive-type stage with high resolution linear encoder built-in has achieved high resolution and high 
accuracy.
● Thin and compact
Coreless linear motor, Linear Way L and Crossed Roller 
Bearing are adopted. As compared with ball screw-driven 
stage, extremely low proﬁle is achieved.

[ Compact type ]
LT…CE
LT···CE is a compact linear motor table with high 
thrust force generating capability, which uses C-Lube 
Linear Way ML, miniature linear motion rolling guide 
in the table guiding parts and adopts lightweight 
aluminum alloy in the moving table.
Low proﬁle design with downsizing thoroughly pursued by 
adopting C-Lube Linear Way ML and small optical linear 
encoder. Minimum sectional height of 30mm (LT100CE) is 
achieved.
Linear Motor Table LT consists of moving ﬁeld coil and 
stator having a magnet arranged facing the inside of 
C-type yoke. Magnetic ﬂux vertically exerted by magnet 
and rotational ﬂux generated around the coil by electric 
current causes the coil to be forced horizontally.
(Fleming's left-hand rule)
By switching the coil current to certain direction corresponding to the 
ﬂux direction, continuous thrust force in a certain direction can be 
obtained and linear motions of the rotator is maintained. In the High 
Thrust Series, as the coils are densely arranged in vertical magnetic 
ﬂux generated by a pair of coil yokes arranged one above the other, 
it can produce extremely high thrust force although it is small.
Direct drive and advanced servo technology has achieved 
high speed stability.
● Compact
● High speed stability
Advanced servo technology has achieved high static 
stability.
This unit is small but can produce a great thrust force. 
Aluminum alloy-made and lightweight moving table has 
achieved the positioning by high acceleration / deceleration 
and high response. It contributes to shortening of tact time.

speciﬁcation track rail in the table guiding parts, 
the LT…LD is a linear motor table enabling the 
long stroke and high-speed operation.
● High speed
● Super long stroke
[ High thrust type ]
LT…H uses C-Lube Linear Way ME in the table 
guiding parts and can produce the biggest thrust 
force among Linear Motor Table LT units without 
impairing the compact feature, so that it is a linear 
motor table best suited for precision positioning of 
a heavy load.
Lightweight table and high 
thrust have achieved high 
acceleration / deceleration and 
high response.
● High thrust
● High acceleration / deceleration
● Air cooling
Direct drive enables both high-precision positioning and 
high speed. Supports high speed operation required for 
long stroke motion. It is possible to 
perform high-speed motion of up to 
3,000mm/s.
Adopting C-Lube Linear Way ME of jointing speciﬁcation track rail, 
this unit has achieved long stroke of up to 2,760mm speciﬁc to 
linear motor driving.
(For stroke products longer than this, please consult IKO. ）
Cooling mechanism for suppressing the 
heating of motor section is optionally set. 
It enables shortening of tact time and 
contributes to improving the 
production efﬁciency.
Although this table is compact in 
shape, it can produce maximum 
thrust force of 900N. This 
unit is best suited to the 
precision positioning of heavy 
load.

● Setup Software
When operating Linear Motor Table LT through ADVA, initial setting of driver parameters is required. Parameter setting for 
driver is performed using the setup software. It can also be used for gain adjustment and operational status check. 
In the driver, the setup software and PC connection cable are not provided. These can be shared in plural drivers but at least 
1 set is required. Please prepare these on your own or place an order separately according to your requirement.
●Motion Network
The ADVA driver for Linear Motor Drive Table LT supports motion network EtherCAT.
Motion network realizes higher performance and higher accuracy of devices free from pulse frequency constraint in pulse 
train command, noise effects in analog command (voltage command), voltage drop due to cable length and effects of 
temperature drifting. Reduction of wiring can also be achieved, so synchronization system with more than one table can 
easily be established.
Features
EtherCAT
This is an Ethernet-based open network communication system developed by Beckhoff of Germany, allowing real 
time control. High speed communication and high accuracy inter-node synchronization provide higher performance 
and higher accuracy of devices. In addition, Ethernet cables available on the market can be used and various 
wiring types can be supported.
SSCNET Ⅲ/H
This is a motion network communication system for servo system control developed by Mitsubishi Electric 
Corporation. It applies the optical ﬁber cables, so noise immunity is improved relative to conventional SSCNET.
MECHATROLINK
The open ﬁeld network communication that connects the controller and various components.
Developed by Yaskawa Electric Corporation and managed by MECHATROLINK Members Association.

Dedicated drivers ADVA and NCD171G are available for Linear Motor Table LT, and the system configuration varies 
depending on the driver used. For ADVA, two types of specification, pulse train specification and high speed network 
EtherCAT speciﬁcation, are available. Table 7 shows the correspondence between drivers and tables. Table 8 shows an 
example of identiﬁcation number for ADVA, and Tables 9 to 11 show the system conﬁguration for each driver. For detailed 
driver speciﬁcation, please see the driver speciﬁcation on page Ⅱ-353 to Ⅱ-356 and Ⅱ-357. 
Please also note that the driver (MR-J4-10B made by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation) compatible with SSCNET Ⅲ/H and that

System Conﬁguration


● Two-axis parallel operation
Implementing rigid combination of two sets of Linear Motor Table LT arranged in parallel enables parallel operation by twoaxis driving.
As compared with conventional single-axis driving and single-axis driven method, the two-axis parallel operation enables 
stabilized positioning mechanism with ﬂame torsion and the delay of right and left drive shafts minimized. This is most 
suitable for inspection devices that need carrying of large size work and wide moving area such as a ﬂat panel display 
production device.
Two-axis parallel operation is prepared based on respective usages. For details of product speciﬁcations, please contact 
IKO.
Comparison of characteristics by driving method
Two-axis parallel operation
single-axis driving and single-axis driven method
・This is driven by two-axis and can generate large thrust force.
・Driving of right and left tables enables positioning mechanism 
with table delay and ﬂame torsion minimized.
・Table delay and ﬂame torsion are minimized, which ensures high 
positioning accuracy.
・As compared with two-axis synchronization control system, this 
can reduce the cost.
・This is driven by single-axis and cannot generate large thrust 
force.
・Only single-axis is driving, which is likely to cause the delay of 
driven-side table and ﬂame torsion.
・Delay of driven-side table and ﬂame torsion tend to occur, which 
cannot ensure the positioning accuracy.

● Rotary positioning table for converting linear motion to rotary motion
● Low profile design with high rigidity
Adoption of Crossed Roller Bearing capable of exerting high 
rigidity in all direction has achieved low proﬁle, high rigidity, 
and high precision.
Alignment Table AT is driven by stroking a rotator linked to table's outer periphery by driving of 
ball screw in a linear direction. In order to adjust the distance L and angle from the center of 
table varied by rotator movement, linear and rotary motion mechanism that follows according to 
the table angle is incorporated in the rotator. Therefore, in Alignment Table, even when moving 
the rotator at a same pitch, the table's rotation angle tends to vary depending on the position, 
so that even when moving it at a constant speed, the rotation speed does not stay constant.
● Positioning repeatability of ±1 sec
A rotator for converting linear motion to rotary motion is 
accurately guided by the combination of Linear Way L and 
precision ball screw, thus achieving the high positioning 
repeatability of ±1 sec.
Placing this unit on the slide table of Precision Positioning 
Table LH enables the conﬁguration of low height XY-θ
multi-axis positioning mechanism.

● Compact precision elevating table
This is an elevating table for performing compact yet high 
precision vertical positioning with unique wedge mechanism 
adopted.
Table dimensions of □120 mm and □200 mm have been 
added to our lineup, including the high accuracy/high rigidity 
type with roller-type linear motion rolling guide incorporated and 
the standard type with superior cost performance. Two kinds of 
wedge reduction ratio are prepared, thus enabling vertical 
positioning of up to 24mm in stroke.
Specifying an optional linear encoder attached unit and 
performing the fully-closed loop control enables the 
positioning of even higher precision.
● Sensor provided as standard
Limit sensor and origin / pre-origin sensors are provided as 
standard. The sensor is compactly built in the main unit, thus 
facilitating the incorporation into a machine or device.
● Available as multi-axis configured Z-axis
Placing the unit on a slide table of precision positioning table 
makes the unit available as Z-axis positioning mechanism of 
the multi-axis table.

Motion Network 　 

NCD 　 

Drivers for linear motor drive tables include those supporting motion network EtherCAT, SSCNET Ⅲ/H, and MECHATROLINK. 
Motion network realizes higher performance and higher accuracy of devices free from pulse frequency constraint in pulse 
train command, noise effects in analog command (voltage command), voltage drop due to cable length and effects of 
temperature drifting. Reduction of wiring can also be achieved, so synchronization system with more than one table can 
easily be established.
Features
EtherCAT
This is an Ethernet-based open network communication system developed by Beckhoff of Germany, 
allowing the real time control. High speed communication and high accuracy inter-node synchronization 
realize the higher performance and higher accuracy of devices. In addition, Ethernet cables available 
on the market can be used and various wiring types can be supported.
SSCNET Ⅲ/H
This is a motion network communication system for servo system control developed by Mitsubishi 
Electric Corporation. It applies the optical fiber cables, so noise immunity is improved relative to 
conventional SSCNET.
MECHATROLINK
The open field network communication that connects the controller and various components. 
Developed by Yaskawa Electric Corporation and managed by MECHATROLINK Members Association.

Accuracy standard of precision positioning table varies depending on models and measurement methods are described 
below. In addition, model testing according to the use conditions such as dynamics testing may be conducted on request. 
Please contact IKO for details.
Precision positioning table is supplied with an inspection sheet or certiﬁcate of passing inspection regarding accuracy 
standard of each model.
Repeat positioning to any one point from one direction 7 
times to measure the stop position and obtain 1/2 of the 
maximum reading difference.
In principle, perform this measurement at the center and 
each end of the stroke length and take the maximum 
obtained value as the measurement value. Indicate the 1/2 
of the maximum difference with ±.
Perform positioning successively in the certain direction 
from the reference position, measure the difference 
between actual travel distance at each position and the 
theoretical travel distance, and indicate the maximum 
difference within the stroke length as an absolute value.
Attitude accuracy (pitching and yawing)
The tilt angles for pitching direction(Mp) and yawing 
direction(My) of the table within the stroke range are 
measured with a laser angle measurement system, and 
the measured value is the value of the maximum reading 
error.
●Pitching （Mp）
Vertical angle change on table travel axis
●Yawing（My）
Horizontal angle change on table travel axis
Refers to parallelism (indicator ﬁx) of the slide table motion and

Measurement of parallelism during table elevating
At the lower most step of the table (Hmin), align the 
indicator with 0 value at the measurement point E on the 
table upper surface with the table mounting surface as a 
reference, and measure heights at the remaining 8 points 
(A to I) with the value as a reference.
Lift up the table and perform the same measurement at 
middle (Hmid) and upper (Hmax) steps. Then obtain each 
maximum difference between measurement values at the 
same point at lower, middle and upper steps.
Take the maximum difference value among all the 9 points 
as the parallelism during table elevating.
If measurement values are as those indicated in the table, 
the maximum difference value among all points should be 
6μm at the point H.
As a result, the parallelism during elevating of this table is 
6μm.

■ Maximum carrying mass
The maximum carrying mass is the mass that satisﬁes the following ①, ②, and ③. It is set for TE…B, TU, TSL…M, TSLH…M, 
TX…M, TC…EB, TM, TS/CT, TSLB, AT, AM, and TZ. The value changes by the position of the mass loaded (length L, height 
H). It is calculated by the formula (L, H) = (0, 0).
①  The mass when the total rating life of the linear motion rolling guide, ball screws or bearings is 18,000 hours with continuous operation at the maximum speed for each model and size, and with an acceleration/deceleration time of 0.2s.
② The mass for which the acceleration 0.3G can be acquired in general.
③  The mass calculated based upon the basic static load rating of the linear motion rolling guide you are using.
Note that the value calculated varies depending on various conditions, such as the size, ball screw speciﬁcations, slide table 
length, or stroke length. The value shown at the speciﬁcations of each model was calculated based on the most severe 
conditions that are typical for each size. For detailed values, please contact IKO.
■ Maximum load mass
The maximum load mass refers to the maximum mass of a steel cube that ensures necessary acceleration: acceleration 0.5G 
for linear motion and acceleration 0.5G in outer circumferential for rotational motion. It is restricted by thrust (torque) characteristics of the motor used, and the larger the carrying mass is, the longer the marginal acceleration time becomes. For linear 
motor drive models (LT, NT…V, NT…H, NT…XZ and NT…XZH) and direct drive models (SA…DE), the dynamic load mass 
representing the relation between acceleration and load mass in standard traveling models is set.

Consideration of Operation Patterns  

Maximum Speed and Resolution  

■ Maximum speed
The maximum speed of precision positioning table is deﬁned by the following equation.
The ball screw drive type is restricted by the allowable number of ball screw revolutions which vary by the stroke length. For 
the timing belt drive, it is calculated with the maximum number of motor revolutions of 900（min-1）. See the speciﬁcations of 
each model for details.
Each linear motor drive model has ﬁxed maximum speed. See the speciﬁcations of each model.
To obtain the actual positioning time, the operation pattern must be considered according to conditions such as acceleration / 
deceleration time and stroke length. See the section of consideration of operation patterns.
■ Resolution
Resolution refers to the minimum feed rate allowed for precision positioning table and can be obtained by the following 
equation.
Each linear motor drive model has ﬁxed resolution. See the speciﬁcations of each model.
Maximum speed（mm/s）＝Ball screw lead（mm）×Allowable number of revolutions of ball screw（min  ）

Timing belt drive
Maximum speed（mm/s）＝Pulley pitch diameter×π（mm）×Maximum number of revolutions of the motor（min  ）

■ Calculation of positioning time
The positioning time taken when the precision positioning table actually moves can be obtained by the following equation.
For applications requiring high precision positioning, the settling time from completion of command pulse input to full stop of 
the table at the positioning point and vibration damping time of the machine device must be considered in addition to the 
constant speed traveling time and acceleration / deceleration time.
 Long-distance positioning
Long distance in this context refers to distance for which 
there is enough constant speed traveling time even taking 
into account the acceleration / deceleration time.

■ Calculation of effective torque and effective thrust force
As a large torque (thrust force) is required for acceleration / deceleration when the precision positioning table is driven, the effective 
torque (effective thrust force) may become larger than the motor's rated torque (rated thrust) depending on the operation rate of 
each pattern in case the AC servomotor or linear motor drive is used. Continuing the operation in this condition may cause 
overheating and seizure of the motor. So ensure that the effective torque (effective thrust force) is smaller than motor's rated torque 
(rated thrust). The effective torque (effective thrust force) by the operation pattern of table is calculated by the following equation.
If the rated torque (rated thrust) of the motor is larger than the effective torque (effective thrust force), continuous operation 
according to the operation pattern is possible.

You can see in the example pattern that it is below the thrust

temperature. See the rated thrust characteristics diagram.)
For the example pattern, the rated thrust is about 117N at

STEP1   Calculation of thrust force required for X-axis 
acceleration
①Force from running resistance  FL
FL＝Ff＋Fc＝3.0＋1.0＝4.0N
②Force from acceleration  Fa

Fa＝（WL＋WT）・


 ＝（5.0＋5.9）×         ＝21.8N

③Thrust force required for acceleration  FP
FP＝Fa＋FL 

＝21.8＋4.0＝25.8N
At this point, check that the FP×k (factor of safety) is below 
the maximum thrust in page Ⅱ̶270. If this value is 
exceeded, review the maximum speed for operating pattern 
and acceleration / deceleration time.
You can see in the example pattern that it is below the 
maximum thrust.
The maximum thrust FM of SA120DE/X＝70N
FP×k＝25.8×1.3＝33.54N＜FM

STEP2  Consideration of effective thrust force
・Effective thrust force  Frms can be obtained as follows.
Frms ＝　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

＝　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

≒11.17N
At this point, check that Frms is below the rated thrust. If the 
rated thrust is exceeded, review the maximum speed for 
operating pattern and acceleration / deceleration time. In 
the example pattern, it can be judged that continuous 
operation is possible.

STEP3   Consideration of thrust force and effective thrust 
force required for Y-axis acceleration
Perform the same calculation as X-axis.
If the operation pattern is the same, the condition is lighter 
for Y-axis as its mass of moving table is smaller. So that is 
omitted in this example.
STEP4   Consideration of torque required for θ-axis 
acceleration
①Torque from rotation resistance  ML
ML ＝Mf＋Mc

＝0.1＋0.0＝0.1N・m
②Torque from acceleration  Ma

Ma ＝（JL＋JT）・


π

＝（0.01＋0.002）×          ≒0.754N・m

③Torque required for acceleration  MP
MP ＝Ma＋ML

＝0.754＋0.1＝0.854N・m
At this point, check that the MP×k (factor of safety) is below 
the maximum torque in page Ⅱ̶270. If this value is 
exceeded, review the maximum speed for operating pattern 
and acceleration / deceleration time. You can see in the 
example pattern that it is below the maximum torque.
Maximum torque MM of SA120DE/S＝2.0N・m
MP×k＝0.854×1.3≒1.11N・m＜MM
STEP5  Consideration of effective torque
・Effective torque Mrms can be obtained as follows.
　Mrms ＝                                  

＝　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

≒0.38N・m
At this point, check that Mrms is below the rated torque. If the 
rated torque is exceeded, review the maximum speed for 
operating pattern and acceleration / deceleration time. In 
the example pattern, it can be judged that continuous 
operation is possible.
※Caution    If the load is offset from the rotation center, 
X- and Y-axis acceleration / deceleration 
generates torque load on the θ-axis. So extra 
care must be exercised.

Precaution for Use  

■ Processing accuracy of mounting surface
Accuracy and performance of Precision positioning table are affected by accuracy of mating mounting surface. Therefore, 
processing accuracy of the mounting surface must be considered according to usage conditions such as required motion 
performance and positioning accuracy.
Reference ﬂatness of the mating mounting surface under general usage conditions is indicated in Table 6.
In addition, the base on which a table is mounted receives a large reactive force, so take enough care about the rigidity of the 
base.

■ Tightening torque for ﬁxing screw
Typical tightening torque to ﬁx the Precision positioning table is indicated in Table 7. If sudden acceleration / deceleration 
occurs frequently or moment is applied, it is recommended to tighten them to 1.3 times higher torque than that indicated in 
the table. In addition, when high accuracy is required with no vibration and shock, it is recommended to tighten the screws to 
torque smaller than that indicated in the table and use adhesive agent to prevent looseness of screws.

■ Safety precautions
・Be sure to earth the ground terminal (The grounding resistance is 100Ω or less.). It may lead to electric shock and ﬁre.
・Use only the power voltage indicated on the device. Otherwise, it may lead to ﬁre and malfunction.
・Do not touch any electrical component with wet hand. It may lead to electric shock.
・Do not bend forcibly, twist, pull, heat or apply heavy load on the cord. It may lead to electric shock and ﬁre.
・Do not put your ﬁnger into any opening during table operations. It may lead to injury.
・Do not touch any moving part during table operations. It may lead to injury.
・When removing the electrical component cover, be sure to turn the power off and disconnect the power plug. It may lead 
to electric shock.
・Do not touch the terminal for 5 minutes after shutting down the power. Otherwise, electric shock due to residual voltage 
may occur.
・When installing / removing the connection terminal, be sure to turn the power off and disconnect the power plug in 
advance.Otherwise, it may lead to electric shock and ﬁre.
■ Precaution for Use
・As precision positioning table is a precision machine, excessive load or shock may impair accuracy and damage the parts. 
Take extra care when handling it.
・Check that the table mounting surface is free from dust and harmful projection.
・Use it in a clean environment where it is not exposed to water, oil and dust particles.
・As grease is applied to the linear motion rolling guide integrated with precision positioning table and ball screws, take dust 
protection measures to prevent dust and other foreign matters from entering into the unit. If foreign matters get mixed, 
thoroughly eliminate the contaminated grease and apply clean grease again.
・Though lubrication frequency for precision positioning table varies depending on usage conditions, wipe off old grease and 
apply clean grease again biannually for normal cases or every three months for applications with constant reciprocating 
motions in long distance. In addition, the Precision Positioning Table in which C-Lube is built delivers long-term 
maintenance free performance. This reduces the need for the lubrication mechanism and workload which used to be 
necessary for linear motion rolling guides and ball screws, allowing large-scale reduction of maintenance cost.
・As precision positioning table is assembled through precise processing and adjustments, do not disassemble or alter it.
・Linear motor drive products have strong magnets inside. Note that any magnetic object around such product may be 
attracted. For use around any device vulnerable to magnetism, please contact IKO.
・Linear motor drive products require parameter settings of programmable control unit or driver for driving. Securely 
conﬁgure parameter settings suitable for the drive motor.
・For Linear Motor Table LT series, motor cord, etc. is connected to moving table, so a space for wiring of cord must be 
ensured in addition to the installation space for the main body. In addition, arrange cord wiring with sufﬁcient curvature so 
that the running resistance does not increase or no excessive force is applied.
