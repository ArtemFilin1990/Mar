Rod End Grades
Heim rod ends are offered in four grades:
precision, commercial, aircraft, and 
military.  Precision rod ends are manufactured to tight tolerances for applications
requiring improved linkage accuracy and
reduced looseness.  Commercial rod ends
are produced using standard materials
and manufacturing methods, and are an
economical choice for industrial applications.  Aircraft rod ends use premium
materials, and have magnafluxed rod end
bodies.  Originally intended for aircraft
applications, aircraft rod ends are used in
many industrial applications where a high
degree of reliability is required.  Military
rod ends are produced in strict accordance with all applicable military specifications and are typically used in military
and commercial aviation applications, or
when Mil-Spec approval is required.
Precision Rod Ends Grade HM and HF four
piece precision rod ends use brass race
inserts for lubricity and clearance control.
They are produced to tight tolerances for
applications requiring a more precise rod
end; for example, a linkage where positioning accuracy is essential.  These rod end
bodies and balls are plated for corrosion
resistance.  Series BHM, HFX G and 
HMX G four piece precision extra capacity
rod ends are the high strength series
intended for more heavily loaded, static and
dynamic industrial applications.  These rod
ends have heat treated bodies for increased
strength and aluminum bronze race inserts
for high bearing capacity.  The rod end
bodies are protective coated for corrosion
resistance and the balls are chrome plated
for superior wear and corrosion resistance.
Series BHM (male) and series HFX G
(female) have common thread sizes.  Series
HMX G (male) have oversized shanks for
additional shank strength.

eim rod ends and spherical plain
bearings are intended for linkage applications where a bearing must accommodate
significant misalignment.  While spherical
plain bearings offer flexibility in housing
and mounting design, the user bears the
responsibility for housing design and the
cost of housing manufacture.  Rod ends
offer greater mounting convenience and
provide a compact, lightweight, economical
design alternative to the spherical plain
bearing.  Heim Bearings Company offers
the industry’s widest selection of rod end
types and sizes.
Rod End Construction
Heim offers three basic rod end constructions.  The four piece rod end uses race
inserts, typically of brass, to provide
lubricity in the bearing area.  This design
offers reduced internal clearance, and 
provides smoother operation.  It is ideal for
dynamic applications.  The two piece rod
end uses a rod end body which is formed
around a spherical ball.  The comparatively
heavy cross section of the rod end body in
the two piece design provides high
strength.  This makes the two piece rod end
ideal for highly loaded, static applications
where high strength is required. The 
cartridge type rod end consists of a 
spherical plain bearing mounted in a rod
end body.  This design allows the optimum
selection of materials for ball, race and rod
end body.  The cartridge type rod end can
also accommodate a PTFE liner for selflubrication.  This design is best suited 
for aircraft and military applications
where material selection is a primary
design consideration.
Self-lubricating Rods Ends
Heim produces metal-to-metal rod ends 
and self-lubricating rod ends.  All metal-tometal rod ends, including brass insert four
piece types, require regular lubrication.
This can be accomplished by splash or
immersion oil lubrication, or by greasing
through optional lubricators (grease fittings).  Self-lubricating types are used
where relubrication is not practical, or in
applications where relubrication is not
desirable, such as on food processing
machinery or in clean environments. Heim
self-lubricating rods ends are available with
bonded PTFE fabric liners, or with molded,
engineered thermoplastic race inserts.

CMHD
HEIM “D”
Self-Lubricating Series
For commercial applications where a
self-lubricating bearing is either
desirable or necessary, Heim developed Heim “D” Series bearings.
Heim “D” bearings are designed with
an engineered thermoplastic race
material and offer a lower coefficient
of friction than metal-to-metal types
that use conventional lubricants.  It is
a resilient material that performs well
under vibratory and dynamic loading
and withstands dynamic loads up to
3500 PSI.
Where to Use HEIM “D”
Bearings
Heim “D” bearings should be used in
applications where the bearing 
cannot be periodically lubricated or
where it is desirable to eliminate the
need for regular maintenance.  They
are also recommended for applications where there is considerable
vibration.  The resilience of the
engineered thermoplastic race
CFHD
CMHD
absorbs vibration without causing
fretting or galling of the surface.  The
torque level of the bearing will be low
because of the low coefficient of 
friction of the hardened steel ball on
the engineered thermoplastic race.
The coefficient of friction for Heim
“D” bearings is approximately 0.1,
but will vary somewhat depending
on the loads, speeds, temperatures,
and solvents that are present.  The
chart on this page shows a typical
bearing wear pattern of Heim “D”
bearings and how they vary with
number of oscillations.
Environmental
Characteristics
Heim “D” bearings have good 
environmental tolerances.  They offer
advantages over bearings that use a
nylon race because the Heim engineered thermoplastic race  absorbs
very little moisture.  It is generally
resistant to alcohols, aldehydes,
esters, ethers, hydrocarbons, weak
acids and bases, water and agricultural chemicals.  Dimensional stability is quite good when exposed to
these substances, however the Heim
engineering department should be
contacted for recommendations on
specific performance characteristics.

STUDS
Studs are used in combination with Heim rod ends to simplify
mounting.  Studs are compatible with the following Heim rod 
end series:
M CR
F CR
HM C
HF C
HM
HF
CMHD
CFHD
The stud is designed to accommodate up to ±25° misalignment 
in any direction and has a wrench flat to facilitate tightening.  
Add letter “Y” to suffix to indicate stud.  Example: CMHD10Y
MISALIGNMENT
The angle of misalignment in a rod end is controlled by the outside
diameter of the head.  The maximum degree of misalignment is
obtained when the head contacts the side of the fork or clevis in
which it is mounted.
Maximum misalignment is calculated by the following formula.
• Rod End Angle (α):
α = SIN-1
– SIN-1
Where:
D = Head diameter or diameter of outer race
H = Housing width
W= Ball width

STATIC RADIAL LOAD
The maximum static radial load permissible for a rod end depends on three factors: race material compressive strength; rod
end head strength; and shank strength.  The maximum static 
radial load is determined by taking the lowest of the three 
following values:
• Race material compressive strengths (R)
R = E x H x X
• Rod end head strength (T)
insert construction
T = [D - (E + .176 H)] x H x X
cartridge type construction
angle of       expressed in radians 
• Shank Strength (S)
male threaded rod end
S = [(root diameter of thread2 x .78) - (N2 x .78)] x X
female threaded rod end
S1 = [(J2 x .78) - (major diameter of thread2 x .78)] x X
Where:
E = Ball Diameter
H = Housing Width
X = Allowable Stress (see table)
D = Head Diameter
N = Diameter of Drilled Hole in Shank of Male Rod Ends
J = Shank Diameter of Female Rod End
STATIC AXIAL LOAD
The maximum available axial load for a rod end is determined 
by the following formula.  This formula does not take into 
consideration bending of the shank due to a moment of force.
Also, this formula does not consider the strength of the stake in
cartridge type of construction.
• Axial Strength (A)
A = .78 [(E + .176 H)2 – E2] x X
Where:
X = Allowable Stress (See Table)
E = Ball Diameter
H = Housing Width

MISALIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS
The angle of misalignment in a spherical bearing is calculated
somewhat differently from that of the rod end because the 
housing is not spherical.  There are three different types of 
mountings in which these bearings may be used as shown, 
and the angle of misalignment is governed by the type of 
mounting adopted.
Shown below are the common mountings for spherical 
bearings and the corresponding formula for calculating the 
angle of misalignment.
General Information
Sleeve Bearings
Sleeve Bearings
Heim manufactures sleeve bearings in
a wide range of materials and sizes 
for industrial, agricultural, and 
aerospace applications.  Pages 52 and
53 describe two standard series of 
self-lubricating bearings that utilize
UNIFLON® Type E liner material.  
This liner meets the requirements of
SAE-AS81820 (formerly MIL-B-81820).
In addition to these standard plain 
and flanged series, Heim designs and
manufactures “specials” to meet 
specific customer requirements.
Working either from a drawing, 
application description or sample 
part, Heim also applies UNIFLON®
liners to customer supplied bearings.
Lined Sleeve Bearings
(Bushings) - Characteristics
UNIFLON® liners in sleeve bearings
eliminate the need for lubricating the
bearings during their useful life.  The
UNIFLON® liner is a cost effective
solution to many design problems
where lubrication is impractical or
undesirable.  UNIFLON® lined sleeve
bearings are ideal for applications
where periodic shock loads or vibrations are encountered.  Heim’s new
Type E liner is recommended for
sleeve bearing applications where 
temperatures range from -65°F to
350°F.  UNIFLON® liners are highly
resistant to most chemical solvents
encountered in bearing applications.
UNIFLON® lined sleeve bearings 
have a lower coefficient of friction 
than metal-to-metal lubricated 
bearings.  For additional information
on UNIFLON® liner characteristics see
page 54.  You are encouraged to 
consult Heim’s engineering department for recommendations on specific
application problems.
Shaft Data
An important factor influencing the
life of UNIFLON® lined sleeve bearings is the condition of the mating
shaft.  It is recommended that the 
shaft have a surface finish of 8 RMS or
better and a minimum surface hardness of Rc 40.  Commonly preferred
shaft materials are hardened corrosion resistant steels, hard anodized
aluminum and any metal accepting
hard chrome or nickel plate.  The 
mating component should be designed such that there are not sharp
edges which could damage the liner
during assembly of the sleeve bearing.
Cross binding or edge loading on the
bearing should be avoided.
Design Inquiry
To request an engineering design on a
specific application, submit either a
drawing or sketch or submit the 
pertinent information.  All requests
will receive prompt design engineering attention and follow-up.

Typical Wear Results
Long Life and High Loads
Burnished races uninterrupted by splits or loading slots,
a full complement of large diameter balls, and deep 
carburized and hardened raceways give the Heim 
UNIBAL® ball bearing superior ability to handle high
loads and provide longer service life.
Thrust Loads
Heim’s unique design and assembly method provides
deep ball grooves in both races and no loading slots,
yielding greater ability to accomodate thrust loads.
Smooth Operation
The burnished races of the Heim  ball bearings provide
far smoother operation than other unground ball bearings. This feature may allow a Heim design to be used in
place of precision ground bearings in many applications.
Easy Mounting
Optional flanged O.D.s are available to simplify 
housing design and mounting.  Heim UNIBAL® ball
bearings are also available with extended inner rings to
allow clevis mounting.

Technical Data
Self-Lubricating Bearings
Why UNIFLON
® TYPE E?
UNIFLON® Type E liner is recommended over other bearing materials
for the following reasons.
1. High PTFE fiber content.  PTFE 
has the lowest coefficient of friction 
of known materials today.
2. The bonding material is a 
polyallomer consisting of two polymers.  One polymer provides adhesive properties.  The second polymer
provides the correct degree of 
elasticity.
3. The backing or basic high strengthfabric in Type E has an inherent 
coefficient of friction only slightly
higher than PTFE (.019).
Where are UNIFLON® Type E 
Bearings used?
Type E bearings are designed for use
in low surface speed high unit loading
where metal to metal is limited or 
non-desirable.  Type E bearings are
available with ratings in high static
unit loads up to 60,000 psi.  For 
specific radial and dynamic load 
ratings on Type E bearings, consult 
the Heim engineering department.
UNIFLON® Type E can be used with
many combinations of hardened steel,
aluminum, titanium and plated 
surfaces, in many environments, and
in temperatures -100°F to 350°F.
Type “VV” Liner
For less demanding or higher temperature applications, Heim recommends its Type “VV” liner.  The 
higher temperature Type “VV” 
carbon filled liner is particularly 
suited for high frequency and low
load applications in temperatures
from -65°F to 500°F.
The chart above shows the coefficient of friction of 
UNIFLON® Type E liner and how this low friction fabric
dramatically improves with increasing temperature.
This chart shows a typical wear pattern of UNIFLON® Type
E liner and how it varies with the number of oscillations.
UNIFLON® - Self-Lubricating
Fabric Liners
To meet the increasing technical
demands on self-lubricating bearings,
Heim has developed UNIFLON® Type
E, a new and improved liner material.
Heim’s Type E is qualified to procurement specification SAE-AS81820 (formerly MIL-B-81820).
UNIFLON® Type E is unique in the 
family of teflon type bearing material.
Type E is a low coefficient of friction
composite of three materials. Most 
composite bearing materials consist of
one layer of low coefficient of friction
material usually PTFE fiber, layered or
interwoven with either a highly 
abrasive fabric such as fiberglass, or a
low-load bearing fabric such as dacron,
coated with resin.  Type E combines a
low coefficient of friction, high tensile,
high compressive strength fabric with
chemically bonded teflon fiber to form
the Type E matrix.
