CPM was established in 1967 as a small mechanical workshop for 
the production of rolling bearings, with the objective of working to 
high craftsmanship standards. Today, the company is a leader in the 
production of special bearings and firmly believes in the quality and 
promotion of Made in Italy products. 
Thanks to this underlying philosophy, CPM has become a reference 
partner in the design and implementation of customised solutions for 
some of the leading Italian and foreign industrial groups.
the company


We specialise in the design and medium 
and high-series production of ball bearings, cylinder roller bearings, tapered roller 
bearings, and needle roller bearings, with 
sizes ranging between 10 mm bore and 
800 mm outer diameter.


CPM is constantly evolving, in terms of turnover, human resources, and productivity. In the brand-new, 
technologically advanced plant of Nova Milanese over 
2 million items targeted at both the Italian and international markets are manufactured every year.
The main types of bearings manufactured by the Company 
are the following:
Single row and double row radial ball bearings
Angular contact ball bearings, with clearance or preloaded
Four-point contact ball bearings
Slim series ball bearings
Self-aligning ball bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings, full or caged
Single or double row tapered roller bearings
Needle roller bearings, full or caged
Crossed roller bearings
Self-aligning roller bearings
Ball and roller wheels
Precision rings


The Company’s headquarters in Via Brodolini, 
which have been operating since 2007, were 
designed so as to improve and increase productivity by applying the most advanced production and management technologies, thanks 
to an ambitious investment plan. The management and production areas were enlarged and 
the utmost care was devoted to the overall facilities layout.
offices


All areas and departments were designed in such a way 
as to optimise and improve work conditions for all employees, with a view to the Company’s constant growth and 
to the future positioning on new emerging markets, as well 
as to a further strengthening on the Italian and German 
ones. To support the Company’s new strategy, specific 
techniques were adopted to reduce wastes and eliminate 
any activities that do not generate value. The introduction 
of “lean production”, the SMED analysis carried out in all 
departments and the implementation of KAIZEN activities 
have resulted in improved flexibility in the production of 
smaller batches, reduced risks of product obsolescence, 
and a shorter lead time, thus leading to increased customer satisfaction.


The design department, thanks to its highly-skilled personnel and excellent know-how, is now capable of developing a well structured, detailed design for the manufacturing of bearings having sizes and features that suit 
specific operating conditions. 
The Company’s long-standing experience provides a valuable contribution to all co-designed projects, where our 
designers further develop and perfect the Customer’s 
original design, proposing innovative solutions to achieve 
maximum performance in terms of product life and optimised industrial processes.


applications


Our special rolling bearings can be used in a large number of industrial sectors and for a wide range of applications: from mechanical transmissions to the textile 
sector, from robotics to electro-mechanical equipment.

CPM’s primary objective is maximum product reliability. 
The concept of “lean production” and the great flexibility 
of CPM’s manufacturing departments ensure a high level of product customisation.
The search for and the constant achievement of worldclass qualitative standards start from the selection and 
use of high purity, top-quality steel, as well as of carefully 
selected components.
production


The first working stage takes place in the turnery 
department, which is equipped with single and 
multiple spindle machines; the delicate, crucial 
stage of heat treatment comes next. 
In this entirely renovated department, equipped 
with state-of-the-art technologies, semi-finished 
products are given the strength and mechanical 
properties required.


The product then goes through the highly-automated preparation grinding and plunge grinding 
section, for which significant investments have 
been made, whereby four additional last-generation grinding machines will be purchased by the 
end of 2011-beginning of 2012.
Great care is devoted to the finishing of rolling 
raceways, a process that is essential to ensure better fatigue strength and longer life of the 
bearings.
production


production


The final stage is assembling, which is performed in two 
separate departments – one for small bearings, one for 
medium-sized and large bearings. Components are assembled partly manually, partly on automated assembly 
lines. The finished products, duly marked and packaged, are then moved to the warehouse, ready to be 
shipped as planned in accordance with the Customer’s 
logistic requirements.


production


At CPM product quality is a start rather than a finish 
point.
Throughout the production stage numerous strict quality checks are carried out both on the production lines 
and in the Company’s internal measurement laboratory, 
where specialised technicians test every single production batch using innovative, sophisticated measurement instruments.
