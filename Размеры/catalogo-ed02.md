flat carrying surface
longer wearlife
Magnetic chains are also flatter since they have no tabs guides.
Clearing the curve can be done easily by lifting the chain.
The curve surface is closed and smooth to avoid dirt 
accumulation. This system provides a longer wearlife,
because the bearing surface of the chains on the curve  
is larger than in other systems, the maintenance is easier.
Magnetic curve is ideal solution for your corners.
Special integrated permanent magnets keep the chain in the 
curve. This system offers a flat carrying surface, therefore the 
best product stability and support. The complete curve consists 
of an upper part with magnets and a separate return part 
mounted together. The return infeed shoe will ensure smooth 
guiding of the chains into the return section.  
Return Part
Material:
PE-UHMW Black about 4 milion
gr/mol for high wear resistance.  
Upper Part
Material:
P8000 PE-UHMW Blue 
8 million gr/mol, virgin.
Special material studied 
for high wear resistance
applications.
P8000 - special compound of PE-UHMW
** Worldwide no restrictions for Magris magnetic curves used with stainless steel chains.
** Some restrictions in specific countries for Magris magnetic curves used with thermoplastic chains.  
    Please contact our Customer Service for more details.
BENEFITS & FEATURES
- Special material for very high speed applications.
- Extremely low coefficient of friction.
- Reduced chain pull. Reduced noice and squeaking. 
- Reduced the consumption of energy.

The use of tangential sprockets and turning 
disks enables the design of compact conveying 
systems with great numbers of curves. 
It becomes easy to realise circuits either  
on the same level or staggered, inclined  
or downclined.

STEEL SPROCKETS
FOR STRAIGHT RUNNING CHAINS AND FOR NEW FLEX MAG / 
NEW FLEX MAG D / NEW FLEX MAG G CHAINS
The sprocket tooth pitch (mm 19,05) is half the pitch of the chain (38,1 mm). Therefore, when a sprocket with an odd number of teeth is used, 
the teeth engage the chain only every other revolution. This doubles the life of sprockets.

conveyor belts 
Example of a conveyor belt  
with chain return guides. 
It’s important to provide a gap for the catenary sag under 
the sprockets, in order to avoid excessive tension on 
the hinges and to make an eventual chain disassembly 
easies. The chain return occurs on guides  
in self-lubricating material (PEUHMW or Nylatron);  
the chain entry radius should be anyway greater than  
the backflex radius (Rd). 
Example of a conveyor belt  
with chain return rollers. 
It’s important to provide a gap for the catenary sag under 
the sprockets, in order to avoid excessive tension on 
the hinges and to make an eventual chain disassembly 
easies. Chain return rollers should have a diameter
corresponding at least to twice the dimension of the  
chain backflex radius (Rd). 
conveyor design 
A few examples of slide guide assembly 
according to chain type are hereunder 
represented. 
It’s important to remember that for narrow-base products 
or products conveyed or more tracks the fundamental 
value is chain distance (Gap).
The lower this value is, the less unstable the conveyed 
product becomes.

chain sizing
According to the maximum allowable working load method. Chain sizing consists of a comparison between the chain tension  
at headshaft, which a chain is subject to, and the maximum allowable working load of the chain itself. The following formulas  
allow an evaluation of the chain tension at headshaft as a function of the different load conditions.

Side flexing conveyor
In this case the calculation of the chain tension at headshaft 
is carried out as the sum of successive loads (draw. 1):
L2 = K(α2) x R2
L4 = K(α4) x R4
1 - Return run
the evaluation of the chain tension in the return run is carried 
out by starting at the driven sprockets following the movement 
of the chain itself up to the return sprocket (draw 2):
Track FE	
F5 = Wc x L5 x f1   
Track FD	
F4 = [F5 + Wc x L4 x f1 ] x T(α4)  
Track FC	
F3 = F4 + Wc x L3 x f1  
Track FB	
F2 = [F3 + Wc x L2 x f1] x T(α2)
Track FA 	
F1 = F2 + Wc x L1 x f1

F0 = F1 x fp x 9,81 
Written in a more explicit manner:
F0 = {[( L5+L4 ) x Wc x f1 x T(α4)+(L3+L2) x Wc x f1] x T(α2) 
       + L1 x Wc x f1} x fp x 9,81
2 - Drive run
• Chain tension at headshaft without accumulation  
The evaluation of the chain tension in the conveying run is carried out 
by starting from the return sprocket following the movement of the chain 
itself up to the drive sprocket (draw. 3):
Track AB	
F1 = F0 + (Wc+Wm) x L1 x f1 + fp x 9,81  
Track AC	
F2 = [F1 + (Wc+Wm) x L2 x f1 + fp x 9,81] x T(α2)
Track AD	
F3 = F2 + (Wc+Wm) x L3 x f1 + fp x 9,81  
Track AE	
F4 = [F3 + (Wc+Wm) x L4 x f1+ fp x 9,81] x T(α4) 
Track AF	
F5 = F4 + (Wc+Wm) x L5 x f1 + fp x 9,81
• Chain tension at headshaft with accumulation  
The component of the chain tension at headshaft due
to the accumulation of material conveyed is evaluated
by starting from the return sprocket towards the drive sprocket,  
for the only track involved by the accumulation (draw. 3).
In this case the total chain tension at headshaft is given by the sum  
of the component without accumulation plus the one due  
to the accumulation of the material:
Track AB	
F1 = F0 + [(Wc+Wm) x L1 x f1 x fp + L1s x Wm x f2 x S] x 9,81
Track AC

chain selection
Having evaluated the chain tension at headshaft which the chain is subject to, and calculated the speed/length of the conveyor 
ratio, the two values are stated in figure 4. The chain suitable for the use in question is the one whose curve is immediately 
above the intersection of the two values.

Ft = Chain tension at headshafts (N)
Ft = Chain tension at headshafts (N)
The 7.10.040 chain, dry-operating, conveys glass wine bottles. The bottles weigh 1,5 Kg each and they are placed on the chain  
at 20 cm intervals (5 bottles per metre). The chain stops and restarts 10 times per hour.
There is accumulation of the 20% operating time and on a length of 8 metres.
Aims:
• Chain checking;
Start up data:
• Speed (v) = 45 m/min.
• Start up factor (fp) = 1,7 (table B)  
• Slippage time percentage = 20%  
• Slippage factor (S) = 0,7 (table C)
Ft  = [(2Wc + Wm) x L x f1 x fp + Ls x Wm x f2 x S] x 9,81
     = [(2 x 2,6 + 7,5) x 12 x 0,20 x 1,7 + 8 x 7,5 x 0,45 x 0,7] x 9,81 
     = 693,72 N
Calculation of the Speed/Length ratio (v/ L) 
v/ L = 45/ 12 = 3,75 m/min/m
Calculation of Power (P)
The “allowable working load” diagram shows that the maximum 
chain tension at headshaft available for that chain and for that 
speed ratio is 1300 N. The selected chain is therefore  
suitable for our purpose.
• Calculation of the power needed by the shaft.
Calculation of the chain tension at Headshaft (Ft)
• Chain weight (Wc) = 2,6 Kg/m
• Conveyed product weight (Wm) = 7,5 Kg/m 
• Friction factor (f1) = 0,20
  (table A: chain-polyethylene wear strip)
• Length with accumulation (Ls) = 8 m  
• Friction factor (f2) = 0,45
  (table A: chain-glass bottle) 
• Conveyor length (L) = 12 m
