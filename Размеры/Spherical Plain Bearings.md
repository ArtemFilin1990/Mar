RBC originated the precision ground single fracture spherical plain bearing and continues to be the leader in design and 
innovation.  Listed below are the basic types of spherical plain bearings that RBC makes with pertinent selection criteria.
Designed to support heavy radial loads under
misalignment.
These bearings also possess
moderate thrust loading capability.  They are
non-separable with a single fractured outer
ring, and are available in open or sealed designs and inch or metric sizes.
With an extended inner ring, the need for
additional locational spacers is eliminated.
The inner ring bore is relieved to prevent
excess bending stress.  Available in open or
sealed designs and inch or metric sizes.
Due to greater inner ring cross section, the
BH-L and MBH series is capable of greater
misalignment.  Available in open or sealed
designs and inch or metric sizes.

Designed to support heavy unidirectional thrust and combination radial/thrust loads.  Elliptical lubricating grooves are a
standard feature.  Available in both inch or metric sizes.
B-DSA-3 ShimPack® Double Acting Angular Contact
B-DSA-3 series bearings can support radial and thrust loads in
both directions.  They are commonly used in articulating joint 
applications.  Tapered bore designs are available, as well as inch
or metric sizes.
Hardened and Precision Ground Steel Bushings are 
available for applications that would see costly wear in the
housing or on the shaft and where no misalignment occurs.
They are supplied with or without oil holes and grooves 
and with various oil groove configurations.
Industrial Rod Ends can be supplied with any style radial
spherical plain bearing.  RBC rod ends are available with a
male or female shank.
Standard Radial Outer Rings are the outer rings from the
standard inch and metric spherical plain bearing offering.
They can be used whenever the user provides the inner ring
or ball stud.
Special Spherical Plain Bearings are available for custom
requirements.  Unique fractures, nonstandard envelopes, 
various degrees of metallurgical hardness as well as unique
coatings and sealing arrangements have been developed for
specific needs.  RBC’s experienced team of engineers is 
available for consultation for your unique requirements.
Up to 300% improved service life provided by innovative lubrication system.  The patented system distributes lubrication to the
load zone even when no load reversal exists and allows relubrication without removing the load.  These bearings provide an
increased life to many problem applications. Available in inch or
metric sizes.
RBC's DuraLube™ self-lubricating spherical plain bearings provide long life in demanding applications. Grease-free operation is
accomplished through the use of a durable PTFE liner system that
reduces friction between the spherical surfaces of the inner ring
and outer ring. These bearings are ideal for applications in which
re-lubrication is impractical or impossible, but longevity is a must.
Available in inch or metric sizes.

The RBC QuadLube®
Long Life Spherical Plain Bearing
Circular Lube Channels
Circumferential Groove
Seal
T
ough applications in construction and material handling requires a spherical plain bearing with 
longer life, less maintenance and less downtime than standard spherical plain bearings. A bearing 
with total interchangeability to standard designs is preferred.  RBC engineering developed the
QuadLube® spherical plain bearing after observing the three predominant factors which contribute to
the failure of spherical plain bearings:
1) Unidirectional loads
2) Heavy loads
3) Neglected lubrication intervals
Each factor contributes to a lack of lubrication in the load zone area which eventually allows for metal to
metal contact and premature failure of the bearing in the application.
RBC engineering developed the QuadLube® spherical plain bearing to solve each of these three failure
modes.  The RBC QuadLube® spherical plain bearing is manufactured within the same envelope dimensions as standard inch and metric spherical plain bearings.  The lubrication system contains four precisely machined circular grooves on the spherical surface of the inner ring. Each circular groove is connected
by a lubrication groove around the circumference of the inner ring.  The bearing is packed with an EP
moly grease and is sealed with lip contacts seals for grease retention.
Industry Applications for
The RBC QuadLube® Long Life 
Spherical Plain Bearing
• Construction Equipment
• Mining Machinery
• Lift Trucks and Material Handling Equipment
• Log Skidders
• Off-Highway Vehicles
• Satellite Dishes


The innovative design of the RBC QuadLube® interconnecting lubricating groove system ensures a 
more efficient distribution of the lubricant by providing channels that transport the grease throughout
the entire bearing, including into the contact area of the bearing under load. In cases of unidirectional
load or when lubrication intervals are missed, the groove system retains extra lubricant where it is
needed for added margin of performance.  In the dirtiest of environments the grooves and channels
capture any dirt or debris and keep these contaminants away from the raceway surfaces.
The RBC QuadLube® long life spherical plain bearing maintains the same size capacity ratings as 
conventional bearings with the same envelope.  They can immediately replace conventional bearings
without modifying housings or shafts.  Should you have a nonstandard spherical plain bearing in your
problem application, RBC can design a QuadLube® bearing specifically for your existing envelope sizes.

Advanced Seal Technology
SpreadLock® Seals for spherical plain bearings
employ double positive contacting lips to keep the
dirt out and the lubricant in.  Compare new
SpreadLock® Seal technology with single or double lip designs oriented in one direction only. 
Positive, yet functional, sealing is one of the
ongoing challenges in bearing design.  In our
quest to develop the definitive seal that would
work more effectively with our spherical plain
bearings, we asked several tough questions to help establish the design priorities. How can we 
provide maximum protection against the entry of contaminants and wear debris while maintaining
proper bearing operation? How do we minimize seal wear and protect the seal from outside 
damage?  Also, we wanted to maximize lube loss with constant pressure on the inner sphere, while
maximizing lube replacement efficiency.
SpreadLock
® Seal
Total Protection Package
The design of the outer ring retention groove and the sealing of the inner ring bore to shaft interface
is critical to the total protection package.  The groove profile is engineered to exert optimum 
pressure on the sealing surface, while reducing the seal profile exposure.  Less profile exposure
reduces the potential of damage and wear.  Optimum pressure is the key to maximizing the 
lube-in/dirt-out advantage and providing the most efficient re-lubrication and purging.
The integrity of the inner ring/shaft is essential to effective overall performance of the bearing.  Even
the most precise fit is subject to movement under load.  Protective SpreadLock® Seals block dirt and
retain lube to help assure stability of the interface.  In addition, inner ring sealing is particularly
important where re-lube is performed through the pin.
Lube reservoir provides
second line barrier
against contamination
Stiff scraping lip keeps
contaminants out.


Advanced Technology
RBC's DuraLube™ self-lubricating spherical plain
bearings provide long life in demanding applications. Grease-free operation is accomplished
through the use of a durable PTFE liner system
that reduces friction between the spherical surfaces of the inner ring and outer ring.  This 
proprietary liner system has been developed for
rigorous industrial applications, and has been
proven successful time and time again. 
Applications
Self-lubricating bearings are being utilized in skid steer, telehandler, off-road forklift, and wheel 
loader applications primarily on the cylinders, as well as on the pivot points of such equipment.  
The benefits of using these bearings include improved field reliability and lowered warranty costs.
DuraLube™ Self-lubricating Spherical plain bearings has also reduced the cost of ownership by eliminating the need for zerk fittings, and costs associated with greasing and maintaining the bearings.
Guidelines for Use
•  These are dry lubricant bearings and should not receive additional lubrication. 
This will minimize entrapment of abrasive dirt and grit.
•  DuraLube™ bearings are dimensionally interchangeable with standard steelon-steel spherical plain bearings.
•  DuraLube™ bearings utilize the same housing and shaft fits as standard 
steel-on-steel spherical plain bearings, thus allowing for easier replacement.
•  Required running clearance is developed through initial compression of the 
self-lubricated liner material.

Advanced Shock Load Protection
The ImpactTuff® spherical plain bearing improves
resistance to shock loads by 300%! In many
rugged applications where substantial impact
loads are common, spherical plain bearings can
break and chip, adding to the high cost of warranties.  In particular, suspension components in
off-highway construction vehicles have been subject to abuse from impacting rocks or abrupt terrain changes.  Often, the result is broken bearings resulting in costly machinery repair.
ImpactTuff
®
Up to the Challenge
The real challenge of the case carburized design is being able to fracture the outer ring to facilitate
assembly.  We designed a unique outer ring profile with a minimal notch exposure that permits controlled fracture through the softer inner core.  The ductile inner core provides a high degree of protection against the devastating effects of impact and shock loads.  ImpactTuff® technology can be
incorporated into almost any traditional RBC spherical plain bearing configuration.
44


A Clean Solution
Designed specifically for applications that involve
high levels of dirt or other contamination, the RBC
CrossLube® spherical plain bearing utilizes the 
latest generation of lube groove design 
technology.  
While this system greatly improves lube 
distribution, it also facilitates relubrication purging
to flush out wear debris and contaminants.
The CrossLube® feature is particularly effective in
dusty, highly contaminated environments, such as
kingpin applications in farm machinery.

The RBC ShimPack®
B-DSA-3 Double Acting Angular Contact
Spherical Plain Bearing
The RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing design eliminates the sliding fit and allows a press fit of the outer
ring.  As the required clearance is determined by RBC application engineers and set at the RBC factory, consistency is maintained from size
to size and bearing to bearing.  The customer simply installs the RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing as
he would any other self-aligning spherical plain bearing, with no need of concern as to the axial clearance or press fit of the outer ring.
The B-DSA-3 ShimPack
® Double Acting
Angular Contact Spherical Plain Bearing
The bearing is mounted with a press fit and cover plate installed.
The proper amount of clearance is already preset into the bearing
at the factory.  As the outer ring is press fit and axially clamped, it
will not rotate and damage the housing.
X
The RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing was developed to ease the installation procedures required on
the assembly line.  Traditionally the bearing assembly was completed, clearance was measured and then the assembly was disassembled,
shimmed and reassembled.  With the RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing, a spacer is preset and individually calibrated at the factory to provide the optimum amount of axial internal clearance.
Old Method of Shimming
The cover plate has to be bolted down until all clearance in the
bearing is eliminated and gap X measured.  The cover plate is then
removed and shims added.  The housing begins to fret and deteriorate as the outer ring slides because of the loose fit.


The RBC ShimPack® Bearing
in an Articulated Joint
51
Like all RBC spherical plain bearings, the RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing is made to withstand
the harsh environment seen by off-highway vehicles.  The B-DSA-3 design is much more tolerant than tapered roller bearings to rough
conditions and seal damage.  Overloads and shock loads which lead to early failure in tapered roller bearings are better tolerated by
the RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing design.  The RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact
spherical plain bearing is the bearing designed specifically for articulating joint applications.
The use of the RBC ShimPack® double acting angular contact spherical plain bearing in articulated joints in place of a tapered roller
bearing offers many advantages.  The misalignment capable B-DSA-3 design means that costly line boring is no longer necessary.
Alignment becomes less critical allowing the relaxation of bore tolerances and an easier assembly.  Assembly also becomes easier as
axial clearance no longer has to be set during installation.  Dirt and water, which would destroy a roller bearing, are more easily tolerated with the B-DSA-3 design.  Misalignment from shaft and housing bore wear have less effect on the RBC ShimPack® double acting
angular contact spherical plain bearing than on a roller bearing as contact geometry is critical to successful roller bearing operation.

SPHERICAL PLAIN BEARING EN GI NEER ING

Figure 1: Outer Ring with Loading Slots
The RBC Single Frac ture De sign
The requirement to keep outer ring halves together and
properly aligned eventually spawned the single frac ture
design. This RBC feature is the industry standard today. After
being frac tured at a single point on its cir cum fer ence, the
outer ring is still a sin gle piece (figure 3). To as sem ble the
inner ring, the outer ring must be spread open far enough to
let the inner ring pass through.
The plane of fracture is 90 deg from the lubricating holes
for both sin gle and double fractured outer rings.
Note: The fracture in the outer ring is intentional.
Figure 2: Double Fractured Outer Ring
Snap Ring
Figure 3: Single Fractured Outer Ring
The loading slot bearing even tu al ly evolved into a
bearing with a fractured outer ring.  Initially, outer rings were
double frac tured, followed later by a single fractured design.
Both designs get by without a loading slot and are insensitive
to the ori en ta tion of the fracture plane with respect to the
load di rec tion as long as the outer ring maintains a press fit
inside a suf fi cient ly rigid housing bore.  A double fractured
outer ring consists es sen tial ly of two segments of ap prox i -
mate ly equal size and a means of holding the bearing as sem -
bly to geth er (figure 2).  After press ing the bearing into a 
housing bore, the fractured surfaces of the two outer ring
halves interlock perfectly.  The fracture line cannot be felt. It
follows that outer ring halves can not be interchanged among
bear ings and must not be inadvertently ro tat ed 180˚ out of
po si tion.
It is not an in di ca tion of a defective bear ing.
In typical applications, spherical plain bearings sup port
heavy static loads allowing for initial misalignment.
Dy nam ic ap pli ca tions are lim it ed to slow os cil la tions and
ro ta tions be low the rec om mend ed maximum pv-value
(pressure*velocity). The pv-value is used to measure the
amount of heat gen er at ed by the bearing.  Spherical plain
bearings can operate above the rec om mend ed pv-value, but
only un der special lubrication con di tions.
Metric spherical plain bearings have evolved dif fer ent ly
from inch di men sion al bearings, not just in their geometry,
but also in their load ratings.  For comparable inner ring
bores, met ric bear ings have a smaller out side diameter and a
small er width, but by convention, their permissible static
contact pres sure is higher.  (See section LOAD RATING).
Basic Radial Bearing De sign
s
pherical plain bearings have spher i cal contact 
surfaces which per mit the inner ring to rotate free ly 
in all di rec tions within bear ing and ap pli ca tion
design con straints. This gives them the ca pa bil i ty to selfalign, which means, for ex am ple, to adjust au to mat i cal ly to
mis align ment stem ming from in ac cu rate machining, frame
dis tor tions from welding, or de for ma tions of pin and
frame due to static and dynamic forc es.  Such mis align -
 ment would gen er ate con sid er able end load ing and cause
early failure of plain cy lin dri cal sleeve bearings.  Thus
spherical plain bear ings are thought to have their origin as
re place ment for plain cy lin dri cal sleeve bear ings or 
bushings and are still occasionally called ball bush ings.
The first modern radial spher i cal plain bearing had a
non-frac tured outer ring with a loading slot slight ly wider
than the inner ring width (figure 1).  Such a bearing can
easily be assembled and dis as sem bled simply by rotating
the in ner ring 90 deg out of plane to where it fits through
the load ing slot.  Because the loading slots take away a 
sig nif i cant portion of the contact area, radial and thrust
capacity in the direction of the loading slots are af fect ed.
The bearing is sensitive to the ori en ta tion of the loading
slots with respect to the main load direction.  Lubricating
with grease is prob lem at ic. It may be lost pre ma ture ly by
escaping through the load ing slots.  Yet, this type of bearing
is still made today for applications where the outer ring
cannot be fractured, either because the outer ring ma te ri al is
too soft for fracturing, or because of application requirements
which cannot tolerate a frac tured outer ring.

More Radial Bearing Designs
RBC QuadLube® Design
With few exceptions, steel-on-steel spherical plain 
bearings used in dynamic applications must be relubricated
periodically.  To be effective, the grease must penetrate into
the contact area between inner and outer ring.  If a bearing
is subject to a unidirectional load, it must be unloaded 
during relubrication or only a minimal amount of grease
will ever reach the contact area.  Most of the lubricant will
accumulate in the unloaded zone and eventually exit 
without benefiting the bearing service life.
The QuadLube® design solves the lubricant flow 
problem of bearings where the load acts always in the same
direction.  The additional circular grooves on the spherical
diameter of the inner ring allow grease to flow into the 
contact area even with the bearing under load.  The grooves
help to collect wear debris which is purged from the 
bearing during a subsequent relubrication cycle.
Heavy Section
In a typical bearing application, the inner ring mounts
on a shaft and its face abuts against a shoulder.  If the 
bearing must support significant thrust loads, the shoulder
diameter should match the outside diameter of the inner
ring at the face to minimize contact pressure.  See the 
catalog pages for this dimension.  A tilting outer ring will
eventually make contact with this shaft shoulder, which
defines the bearings maximum tilt angle (figure 4).
CAUTION: The actual tilt angle of a bearing
assembly may be limited by the design of 
surrounding components.
Figure 4: Maximum Tilt Angle
To increase the tilt angle of a standard bearing, the
width of the inner ring must be increased.  But simply
increasing the width is not sufficient because there would
be no inner ring face left if we did not also reduce the
inside diameter of the inner ring.  These inner rings with
greater width and wall thickness form the heavy section
series BH-L (figure 5). For a given shaft size, the heavy 
section bearings have greater misalignment capabilities and
a greater load carrying capacity compared to the standard
series at the cost of increased overall dimensions.
a
Tapered Bore Inner Rings
Bearings with heavy section inner rings are also 
available with a tapered bore, see series BT-L (figure 6).
The taper is 1:8 or 1.5" per ft on diameter.  There are 2 main
reasons for using a tapered bore bearing: 
•To prevent rotation between inner ring bore and shaft. 
•To control the diametral clearance of the bearing 
assembly.  As the inner ring is forced up the tapered pin, its
outside diameter expands effectively reducing the diametral clearance.
CAUTION: Reducing the operating clearance
below 0.001" (0.025mm) may increase bearing
friction and wear rate.  A substantial thrust force
in the direction of the large end of the taper may
cause additional inner ring expansion which could
lock up the bearing.
DuraLube™ Maintenance-Free Bearings
RBC offers maintenance-free bearings consisting of a 
chromium plated inner ring, an outer ring with a bonded 
PTFE liner and seals.  The liner provides excellent load 
bearing capacity and a low wear rate (figure 8).
Extended Inner Rings
For applications with substantial outer ring tilt, for
example yoke supported rod ends of some hydraulic 
cylinders, RBC offers radial bearings with extended inner
rings (figure 7). Using a bearing with an extended inner
ring obviates the need to add separate spacers to the 
bearing assembly to create the axial space required by the
outer ring housing.
CAUTION: Spacers and inner ring extensions
increase the distance between pin supports.  At
high loads, pin deflection may become a problem.

Sealed Bearings
Except for the very small sizes, all radial spherical plain
bearings can be ordered with integral seals.  Their function
is twofold, retain the lubricant as much as possible inside
the bearing and slow the ingress of contaminants.  Rubber
or plastic seals work best in bearings which experience 
circumferential motion or very frequent tilting, which tends
to keep the contact surfaces clean.  The seals are not effective at scraping off paint or accumulated and hardened dirt
during an occasional tilting motion.
Angular Contact Bearings
Single Acting
Angular contact bearings, RBC series B-SA, are intended for applications with thrust loads exceeding the
capability of a radial bearing.  Angular contact bearings
can support both radial and thrust loads.  Single acting
bearings are separable and support thrust loads in only
one direction (figure 9).  To support heavy thrust loads in
both directions, use either 2 single acting bearings mounted
in an “O” or “X” configuration (figure 10) or consider a 
double acting bearing, see below.  Angular contact bearings
do not have the misalignment capabilities of radial bearings,
in fact, the angle of misalignment is generally quite small.
Double Acting
Combining two single acting angular contact bearings
into a singular unit yields a double acting bearing with a
heavy section inner ring, the RBC series B-DSA3 (figure 11).
This type of bearing is often used as a locating bearing
because it can support much heavier thrust loads than a
standard radial bearing.  Like a single acting bearing its
angle of misalignment is limited.  The heavy section inner
ring allows a tapered bore with the same advantages and
disadvantages as described above.
As in all angular contact bearings, the proper axial
clearance after assembly is critical.  To eliminate the need
for external shims, RBC produces these bearing assemblies
with an axial clearance preset at the factory.  A shim pack
inserted between the two outer rings determines the actual
clearance.  The thickness of this shim pack may differ from
one bearing assembly to the next, therefore care must be
taken not to mix components from different assemblies.
The ties of each bearing should only be cut immediately
before installation.
CAUTION: Do not interchange components of
ShimPack® Bearings.
The shim pack spacer is an elastic component.  To 
prevent excessive elastic or plastic deformations, the 
catalog pages list a recommended shim pack compression
force (figure 12). Such a compression force could be generated by an end plate being tightened down with a number
of bolts.  As long as the clamping force does not exceed the
recommended shim pack compression force, the listed axial
bearing clearance will be maintained.  Clamping beyond
that limit will start to plastically deform the shim pack
spacer and reduce the axial bearing clearance accordingly.
Unless such an effect is actually intended, the assembly
instructions should specify a maximum tightening torque
for the bolts.
CAUTION: Observe the maximum recommended
shim pack compression force.

Material and Spec i fi ca tions
Inner and outer rings are man u fac tured from through
hardened bear ing quality steel per ASTM A485, and, unless
otherwise specified, heat treated to HRc 56 minimum for
op ti mum wear resistance.  The spherical contact surfaces
are pre ci sion ground.  Inner and outer rings are phosphate
treated prior to coating with a dry film lubricant (MoS2).
The inch and metric radial bear ings described in this cata -
log meet the requirements of series 3 of ANSI/ABMA Std 22.
Except for the larger sizes, the outer rings of radial bear -
ings are single fractured which allows assembly of the inner
ring.  Larg er bearing sizes have double fractured outer rings
and can be dis as sem bled if necessary.  These bearings carry
the suffix -9L. The fractured rings may be slightly out-ofround in the free state, but will round up when mounted in a
prop er housing bore.  It is gen er al ly not necessary to orient
the frac ture plane relative to the load direction.
Load Ratings
Both inch and metric bearings con sist of the same high
quality, high strength bearing steel, with a strength of
material of 285,000 to 300,000 psi [1965 to 2069 MPa].
In most applications the bearings are mated with 
shafts and hous ings made of lower strength steel, which
makes it impossible to realize a contact stress level ap -
proach ing this magnitude.  For practical pur pos es, the
bearings must be down rated to a level where they can
safe ly work with lower strength mat ing components.  (See
also sections on housing design, shaft design, typical 
failure modes).  Ap pli ca tions with loads in excess of the
recommended load limits are possible but should be
reviewed by RBC engineering.
By convention, the permissible contact stress has been
defined dif fer ent ly for metric and inch di men sion al bear -
ings. The def i ni tions given apply to radial bearings, they
are similar for other bearing types.
A) Inch Dimensional Bearings
      The maximum recommended static contact pressure is 
      50,000 psi [345 MPa].  The max i mum recommended 
      dynamic contact pressure is 25% of that or 12,500 psi 
      [86 MPa].
      The radial and thrust ratings are based on the pro ject ed 
      area and can be derived with the following equations:
B) Metric Bearings
      The static radial load limit is given at a pressure of 430 
      MPa [62,370 psi].  The maximum rec om mend ed dynamic
      contact pressure is 20% of that or 86 MPa [12,470 psi].  
      The static thrust load lim it is based on a contact pressure
      of 215 MPa [31,185 psi].  No al low ance is made to 
      account for the effects of lubricating groove and under-
      cuts. The equations are then:

CO   = 430 * K * C / 1000  [kN]

COA = 215 * C2 * ( /4) / 1000  [kN]

CO   = recommended static radial load limit [kN] 

COA = recommended static axial load limit [kN]

K   = spherical diameter [mm]

C   = outer ring width [mm]
For comparable bearing inside di am e ters, e.g. 2.000" and
50mm, inch dimensional bearings typically have a some what
larger outside di am e ter and considerably greater width.  In
this particular case, the projected gross radial contact area for
the 2" bearing is 4.3125 in2 (2782 mm2) compared to 2.9078 in2
(1876 mm2) for the 50 mm bearing.  For a given load, the inch
dimensional bearing typ i cal ly sees a much lower con tact pres -
sure but requires more mount ing space.

Working Loads
STATIC - The static load limits given in the tables are safe
bearing operating loads, provided housing and shaft are 
sufficiently rigid to prevent excessive deformation.  The safety
factor against static fracture is greater than 1.5.  See the 
sections on shaft and housing designs to check for conditions
which could require reducing the bearing load.
DYNAMIC - Applications are considered to be dynamic if
the bearing is subject to more than initial misalignment or an
occasional oscillation.  Spherical plain bearings are best suited
for oscillating motion as in hydraulic cylinders.
The dynamic bearing load for grease lubrication should not
exceed:
a) the dynamic capacity given in the tables and
b) a pv value (pressure*velocity) of 10,000 psi*ft/min. 
These limits do not apply to oil lubrication. To find the 
p*v-value, use the following equation:

Housing Design
To safely support the high load capacity of spherical plain
bearings, the housing must have sufficient strength to avoid
excessive deformation and fatigue failure. Certain housing
types like cylinder rod eyes and pivot brackets under tensile
stress experience maximum stress at points perpendicular 
to the line of force.  To obtain the maximum tensile stress, 
multiply the normal tensile stress of the total cross section 
by a factor “K” found in figure 16.  The result must be less 
than the endurance limit of the housing material.

Housings must be sufficiently strong to prevent excessive outer ring deformation.  Sufficient housing strength can
be achieved either by a great enough wall thickness, here
expressed as a ratio of housing outside diameter divided by
housing bore, or by selecting a higher strength material. The
effects of housing wall thickness and strength on available

Operating Conditions
TEMPERATURE - The maximum operating temperature of sealed bearings is limited by the seal to 250 deg F.
Standard bearings without seals can operate without 
modifications from -60 deg F to + 350 deg F.  For operation
below -60 deg F and above +350 deg F, up to +500 deg F, it
is recommended to use bearings temperature stabilized at
the factory.  For operation to +1000 deg F and at cryogenic
temperatures, contact RBC engineering.
ENVIRONMENT - Standard bearings are phosphate
treated and coated with a dry film lubricant (MOS2). This
surface treatment provides a certain protection against 
corrosion from atmospheric conditions and an occasional
splash.  Additional protection should be supplied for 
operation in continuously wet environments by adding
internal or external seals. RBC can supply bearings with
special coatings for underwater applications.
Ingress of hard solid particles like debris, sand, grit
and mud will accelerate the bearing wear and may clog 
lubricating holes.  The bearing should be protected from
exposure to solid particles.
Mounting - Fractured Outer Rings
Bearings with single or double fractured outer rings
(series B-L, BH-L, MB, MBH) should be mounted with an
interference fit in the housing.  The interference fit corrects
any out-of-roundness of the outer ring due to the fracturing process and will make the fracture line functionally 
invisible.  For light loads of less than 20% of dynamic 
capacity, an ISO N7 fit may be used.  RBC recommends
using  an ISO R7 fit whenever possible.  The internal 
bearing clearance can accommodate the reduced spherical
diameter of the outer ring caused by an R7 press fit. An
even heavier press fit may be required in applications with
heavy shock loads, a rotating load on the outer ring, or
when the housing is made from a light metal.  In the case
of heavier fits, the mounted diametral clearance must be
reviewed.
Mounting - Solid Outer Rings
The bearings with non-fractured outer rings are the
single and double acting angular contact series B-SA, MBSA, B-DSA3. While the outer rings of single acting angular
contact bearings may be heavily press fitted, it is often
desirable to maintain axial adjustability for double acting
bearings. An ISO N7 fit is still light enough to move outer
rings axially in the housing bore without too great a force.
CAUTION: Outer rings of angular contact
bearings subject to heavy thrust loads must not
be clearance fitted.
Mounting - Inner Rings,
Cylindrical Bore
It is generally recommended to press fit the inner rings
where feasible to prevent rotation taking place between inner ring bore and shaft.  If assembly or operating conditions
require a loose fit, it is preferable to let the inner ring slide
on the shaft rather than the outer ring rotate in the housing.
Mounting - Inner Rings,
Tapered Bore
Heavy section inner rings of the series BT-L and BTDSA3 feature a tapered bore with a taper of 1:8 (1.5" per ft
on diameter).  Tapered bores are useful to prevent inner
ring rotation on the pin and to control the diametral 
bearing clearance by expanding the inner ring.
To ensure sufficient operating clearance for the bearing, the inner ring clamping forces given in the table
should normally not be exceeded.


Figure 18: Reduce Contact Pressure by Using a
Hardened and Tapered Spacer
Grease Lubrication - It is recommended that the 
bearings be thoroughly lubricated with grease at the time
of installation.  Lubrication after installation may make it
difficult for the grease to penetrate into the load zone. Failure
to do so may cause surface damage to the bearing rings 
during the critical run-in period.  Steel-on-steel bearings must
be relubricated periodically depending on operating conditions.  The frequency and efficacy of relubrication greatly
influence the ultimate bearing service life.  For example, more
frequent relubrication is necessary if the bearings operate in a
dirty and dusty environment. The grease flow through the
bearing helps purge contaminants.
Radial bearings can be relubricated either through the
shaft or the housing.  In those cases where rotation between
inner ring bore and shaft must be expected, relubrication
through the shaft helps to lubricate that interface.
To become effective, the grease must be able to reach
the contact area between inner and outer ring.  In applications where the load direction alternates, e.g. the push-pull
type action of a hydraulic cylinder, the grease will be
moved around due to the different inner ring positions.
By contrast, in applications where the load always acts
in the same direction, e.g. in some suspension systems,
grease will not be able to flow into the load zone, if the
bearing is relubricated under load.  For effective lubrication,
the bearing must be unloaded.  Alternatively, use the RBC
developed bearing with special lubricating grooves, the
QuadLube® series, which permits relubrication under load.
See also section “More Radial Bearing Designs”.
Angular contact bearings with extended lubrication
grooves, series B-SA-1 and B-DSA3-1, have lubricating
grooves extended to the small diameter of the outer ring to
facilitate grease flow through the bearing while under
load.  Angular contact bearings without these lube groove
extensions should not be relubricated while under heavy
thrust load or air may become trapped in the grease 
passages which will expell the grease promptly.
Recommended grease type: for operating temperatures between -40 deg F and +250 deg F, use a lithium
based grease, NLGI Grade 2, with EP and MoS2 additives.

HARDENED SPACER
Shaft Design
With the exception of bearings under light load and
press fitted inner rings, it is generally recommended that
shafts or pins be heat treated to a surface hardness of HRc
55 min and have a surface finish of 32 rms. Under dynamic
operating conditions and with a loosely fitted inner ring, it
must be expected that rotation takes place between inner
ring and shaft.  Under very heavy loads, even an interference fit does not guarantee that the inner ring will not
rotate on the shaft.
Thrust loads on radial bearings are transmitted via the
face of the inner ring.  The contact stress of this annular
area should be checked against the yield strength in 
compression of the shaft material or any spacer which may
be used.  Even under static conditions, it may be necessary
to harden the shaft shoulder to prevent plastic deformation.  Hardened spacers with a tapered OD may be used if
the shoulder cannot be heat treated (figure 18).
Lubrication
Standard RBC spherical plain bearings are phosphate
treated and coated with a dry film lubricant (MoS2).  This
surface treatment is sufficient for static applications and
occasional movements.  If used in a dynamic application,
the bearings must be lubricated with oil or grease.
Oil Lubrication - Steel-on-steel bearings operating in
an oil bath can be essentially maintenance-free.  This can
be accomplished by enclosing the entire bearing assembly
in a gearbox style structure or by mounting spring loaded
lip seals next to the bearings.  The latter is only feasible in
applications with very little tilting motion.  Bearings subject to large degrees of tilting will require an oil filled boot.
Note: The integral seals of spherical plain 
bearings are not suitable for sealing against oil
pressure.
For oil lubrication at ambient temperature use      
#90 gear oil.

Bearing Failure Modes
This section is intended to help the user identify bearing
problems and correct or prevent their causes.  By definition,
the useful service life of a spherical plain bearing has ended
after one of the following condition occurs:
• Outer ring, inner ring, or both are broken.
• The coefficient of friction exceeds 0.22. 
• The diametral clearance has grown to more than the 
application can tolerate.
1. Component Fracture
1.1 Causes of outer ring failure
• During assembly:
Pressing the outer ring into the housing bore at
an angle, trying to press fit the outer ring by
pushing against the inner ring face, trying to
press fit the outer ring with hammer blows.
• During operation: 
Excessive outer ring deformation due to shock
loads, thin walled housing, partial outer ring
support, insufficient interference fit.
1.2 Causes of inner ring failure
• During assembly:
Attempting to mount bearing in the housing by
pushing against the inner ring face.
• During operation: 
Excessive clearance between shaft and inner
ring bore.  Excessive shaft deflection.
2. Excessive Friction Due to 
Adhesive Wear
• Appearance:
Inner and outer ring spherical surfaces have
deep gouge marks, chunks of metal are torn
out of the surface. The bearing makes a
screeching noise during operation.
• Causes: 
Excessive pv-value, excessive dynamic load, lack
of maintenance, insufficient lubrication where
lubricant does not reach the load zone, contamination by hard particles, rust and corrosion.
3. Excessive Diametral Bearing 
Clearance Due to Abrasive Wear
• Appearance:
Inner and outer ring spherical surfaces are
shiny, appear polished.  Ridges are worn into
the contact area.
• Causes:
Contamination by a powdery substance or
mud, lubrication insufficient to flush wear 
particles from the contact area.

Steering Cylinder
The steering cylinder of the loader uses a B-Lbearing where
radial loads are present.
Clevis
The boom cylinders and connections on the shovel incorporate a B-L bearing into a typical clevis mount application.
Articulated Joint
B-DSA-3 and B-L spherical plain bearings work together in
an articulated joint of the front end loader.  The B-DSA-3 is
well suited for the heavy thrust loads in both directions
which may occur in this type of application.  The B-L in the
top position takes only radial loads.
