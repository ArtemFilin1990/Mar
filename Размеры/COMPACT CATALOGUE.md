Since 1948, the Optibelt company has 
been manufacturing a wide variety of 
drive belts, drawing on more than a 
century of experience of working with 
rubber. Constant investments in materials research and production technology as well as growing knowledge
of the constraints associated with the 
various fields of application have led
to the further development of the 
belt into a high-tech drive element, 
which has allowed the performance limits of the machines to 
be pushed further and further.

optibelt RED POWER 3 – MAINTENANCE-FREE HIGH PERFORMANCE
Wrapped V-belts consist of a rubber core, tension cord, rubber top surface and an enveloping fabric wrap. The wrapping 
is particularly gentle on the flanks of the belt pulleys. The design of the tension cords determines the performance and ease 
of maintenance of the drive. The optibelt RED POWER 3, for example, uses a transverse fibre blend that can withstand high 
dynamic loads. Flexibility, abrasion resistance and bending flexibility included.

PERFORMANCE 
SPECIALLY DEVELOPED FOR HEAVY-DUTY APPLICATIONS IN MECHANICAL 
ENGINEERING, THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE NARROW V-BELTS AND 
optibelt RED POWER 3 PROVIDE POWERFUL DRIVE SOLUTIONS FOR EVERY 
REQUIREMENT. 
Both belts operate at a constant rate with an efficiency of almost 97 percent, while commercially available V-belts only 
achieve a maximum of 94 percent.  
Smooth power transmission results in more power, while at the 
same time, using less energy. In addition, the commercially 
available narrow V-belt offers a favourable price-performance 
ratio with considerably reduced follow-up costs due to extended 
maintenance intervals compared to commercially available 
V-belts. 
The optibelt RED POWER 3 requires a higher initial investment, but is maintenance-free and especially the best choice 
when high performance is required with a slim design. Since it 
achieves up to 50 percent higher performance compared to 
standard V-belts, optibelt RED POWER 3 belts achieve the same 
power peaks in identical drive situations without any loss using 
fewer belts overall. This results in sustainable overall savings in 
terms of materials and maintenance.
FOR EVERY REQUIREMENT
PERFORMANCE COMPARISON FRICTIONAL


optibelt RED POWER 3 S=C Plus
HIGH PERFORMANCE WEDGE BELTS
Maintenance-free optibelt RED POWER 3  
V-belts and kraftbands have an up to 50 % 
higher power transmission capacity 
compared to wedge belts in their standard 
technical design. Thanks to lower maintenance costs and a reduced demand for 
replacements due to fewer belts and 
smaller pulleys, up to 35 % cost savings are 
possible.  
This means that up to 18 % of the costs can 
be saved even for new acquisitions. 
Additional cost savings result from the 
space-saving design as well as minimised 
shafts and bearings.
The tension cord consists of a special 
polyester cord. Thanks to special 
­treatment of­the­tension­cords,­the­optibelt 
RED POWER 3 high performance wedge 
belt is highly stretch-resistant and maintenance-free so that re-tensioning is not 
necessary. The transverse fibre blend 
above and below the tension cord provides 
especially high dimensional stability. The 
abrasion-resistant special wrapping fabric 
improves the flexibility compared to wedge 
belts in their standard technical design.
•  maintenance-free; optimum tension 
over the entire lifetime 
•  new version: more compact, affordable 
structure compared to drives with 
conventional wedge belts
•  S=C Plus, always the right length for

optibelt RED POWER 3 Classic S=C Plus
CLASSIC HIGH-PERFORMANCE V-BELTS
optibelt RED POWER 3 Classic S=C Plus has 
a classic belt section and replaces standard 
technical models of classic belts in existing 
drives. 

 These belt profiles allow a flatter design 
compared to wedge belts, making smaller 
pulley diameters possible despite an 
identical upper width. The minimum pulley 
diameters are correspondingly smaller.
Optibelt RED POWER 3 Classic belts meet 
the well-known close S=C Plus nominal 
length tolerances and so are always the 
right length for sets without re-measuring. 
Applications
As a classic among V-belts, optibelt RED 
POWER 3 Classic is used in many general 
mechanical engineering applications, mainly 
in existing drives in America and Asia.
Classic belt sections are still very common 
there.

The new optibelt BLUE POWER high 
performance wrapped wedge belt has a 
high-strength aramid cord, and is suitable 
as an individual belt, in a set or as a 
kraftband and is particularly suited for 
large, heavily loaded drives.
The optibelt BLUE POWER wedge belt has 
about twice the capacity of a wedge belt 
in the standard technical design. This 
translates to up to 100 % extra performance.

optibelt SK S=C Plus
WEDGE BELTS
optibelt SK S=C Plus  
The optibelt SK wrapped wedge belt was 
developed particularly with mechanical 
engineering in mind, where it replaces the 
classic V-belt. It transmits some 50 % more 
power in comparison and so makes it 
possible to use more compact and lower- 
priced drives as a result when making new 
acquisitions. 
Existing drives, such as B/17, with a classic 
section can be replaced with the SPB 
wedge belt section. In order to do so, it is 
essential to take account of the minimum 
pulley diameter required for wedge belts, 
which is greater than for classic V-belts, 
despite its identical width, due to the 
increased thickness of the wedge belt. It is 
also necessary to use suitable pulleys for 
wedge belts.   
The wrapped wedge belt has the same out- 
standing attributes of the Optibelt S=C Plus, 
with an efficiency of nearly 97 %, and is 
always the right length for sets without 
measuring.
•  high efficiency
•  considerable energy-saving
•  excellent running properties
•  superior price-performance ratio
•  low maintenance costs

optibelt DK
DOUBLE SECTION V-BELTS
optibelt DK  
•  flexible and low-stretch design
•  excellent running properties
•  outstanding flexibility
•  low-stretch characteristics
•  high level of performance
Due to the tensile cord situated in the centre 
of the belt section, optibelt DK double 
section V-belts are extremely flexible and 
low-stretch.
They are therefore particularly suitable for 
use where two-way bending occurs. 
optibelt DK double section V-belts are used 
if several pulleys are located on one level 
and the direction of rotation of one or 
several driven pulleys is to be changed 
without crossing the belt. The optibelt DK 
double section V-belt is ideally suited for 
use in typical serpentine designs.
Special versions with different belt structures are possible. Double section V-belts 
are mainly used for agricultural machinery. 
They are increasingly used, however, in 
mechanical engineering.

THE DIAGRAM SHOWS: 
Our belt sizes are closer to the nominal

of our competitors are also within the 
standard range, but our S=C Plus V-belts 
are even closer to the nominal length 
than the standard specifies for belt sets 
in multi-groove drives. They have a 
constant length. It‘s the one that it says 
on it. And that is why we called it
S=C Plus: Set = Constant.
Our guarantee for the lowest tolerances.

The norm is not enough for us. Because precision is in demand in our business. This is the only way our customers can count  
on the best. This is why our S=C Plus V-belts are closer to the nominal size than standards such as DIN and ISO specify. You 
cannot buy our S=C Plus V-belts as a set. They do not have a set ID. Thanks to the closest tolerances to the nominal dimension, 
each belt fits anywhere in the set without any additional measurement.

DRIVE
TIMING BELTS OF THE optibelt OMEGA SERIES ARE OPTIMISED FOR USE 
IN SYNCHRONOUS POWER AND POSITIONING DRIVES. 
Since their geometry has been matched to the common rounded pulleys, they are not only universally applicable, but also work 
maintenance-free without speed loss and with a constant transmission ratio, while at the same time running very quietly. While 
the optibelt OMEGA standard belt meets medium power requirements for slow and fast running drives, the optibelt OMEGA HP 
is the best choice for extremely heavily loaded, fast running drives. It is not only narrower, which reduces the bearing load and 
further reduces material costs for the drive implementation, but also achieves a performance level that is up to 150 percent 
higher than that of a standard belt in a direct comparison with it.

OMEGA 2in1
THE PROFILE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
Thanks to the special tooth form of the optibelt OMEGA 2in1, air 
can escape laterally from the drive pulleys. Contact with the drive 
pulley is virtually frictionless and noiseless. 
OPTIMAL COMPATIBILITY
The enhanced profile of the optibelt OMEGA 2in1 fits perfectly with HTD and RPP drive pulleys with 3, 5, 8 and 14 mm gaps. 
The optibelt OMEGA 2in1 is the logical further development of round and curved tooth profiles. With an efficiency of 98 %, 
the optibelt OMEGA 2in1 combines maximum economy with optimum power transmission. Its special profile is compatible with 
HTD and RPP drive pulleys. That is: One drive belt covers both pulley types perfectly – without any double stockholding. And 
thanks to the special tooth profile, it is audibly quieter than other timing belts.
