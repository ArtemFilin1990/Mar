developing into the ground field, Nice today produces a complete
line of precision ground, semi-ground, and unground bearings and
bearing assemblies. They are made in easy-to-use inch dimensions
and are recommended for medium loads with speeds up to 5000
rpm. They are available with nylon retainers as standard with steel
and stainless steel retainers optional. They are also available with a
variety of seal and shield combinations. Metric ball bearings are
also made for customers with special requirements.  Focus industries for Nice Ball Bearings include the automotive, agricultural,

TABLE of Contents


Thrust bearings carry loads applied
parallel to the axis of the bearing
bore. They are not designed to accommodate radial loads.
Combination radial and thrust bearings are
designed for simultaneously applied thrust
and radial loads.  Combination assemblies
will also carry pure thrust loading; however,
they are not recommended for straight
radial loads unless provisions are made to
keep the inner rings and outer rings in proper  contact with the balls.
Radial bearings are designed primarily to carry loads perpendicular to
the axis of the bearing bore.  They
will also accommodate limited thrust
loading or a combination radial and
thrust load.
Nice® Ball Bearings, Inc., produces a full 
line of ground, semi-ground, and unground 
bearing assemblies.  To choose the exact bearing
you need, start with the Nice® line of standard
inch-dimension, radial, angular contact and thrust
ball bearings.  Standard series bearings can be
customized to include many features that can 
satisfy the demands of many special applications.
They are available with special bores, modified
outer ring shapes, extended inner rings, locking
devices, and flanged housings.  Standards can be
ordered sealed, shielded, or open, and are offered
in ground and semi-ground grades to deliver the
most cost effective solution for your application.
If you are now designing with only ABEC-1 
level or higher bearings, chances are there may
be a more economical solution to your application.  A Nice® application engineer can help you
determine the exact precision your design
requires, and show you how to take advantage 
of the savings, selection and special features
available in our standard series.  Even when a
standard isn't the answer, our engineers can
deliver an economical, modified standard 
design that is "fit for purpose."

Modified Standards
Modified standard bearings feature a standard
cage and ball complement or a full ball complement,
with custom engineered modifications to the other
bearing components.  The exact inner and outer ring
dimensions and designs can be combined with a wide
range of seals, shields, special greases, special materials
and special finishes.
Modification instead of full customizing gives the user
the benefits of a fully custom bearing with lower costs
and faster delivery times.  Prototype lots are readily
affordable and available for testing and evaluation.
Modified standard bearings offer the greatest value
for your bearing dollar by offering custom bearings 
at standard prices.  Here are some of the many ways
we can modify standard ball bearings to fit any 
application.
Outer Rings
Outer rings can be custom engineered to include milled
slots, snap rings, track grooves, or even a variety of
plastic tires.  Add to this flanges or pulley units and a
variety of custom solutions are readily available.
Inner Rings
A variety of bore shapes and sizes can be custom
engineered to simplify mounting procedures, reduce
assembly costs, and allow misalignment.

Materials and Finishes
Nice® has extensive experience with a variety of 
special materials and finishes developed to stand up
to various contaminants or to take unusually hard
wear.  Nice® bearings are made from steels of various
chemical compositions. Carburizing grades are case
hardened to desired depths and hardness values for
wear and breakdown resistance.  High carbon 
chrome alloy steels are through hardened for high
wear and fatigue resistance.  Stainless steels are 
available for corrosion resistance and food service 
applications.  Special platings and finishes such as
zinc, black oxide, and thin dense chrome are available for special applications.  Nice® application 
engineers can assist in bearing selection for special
material applications.

Semi-ground 3000 Series™ bearings are specially 
designed to provide a line of economical bearings for
lighter loads than the 1600 Series™ and speeds to approximately 2500 rpm.  The 3000 Series™ bearings are dimensionally the same as the 1600 Series™ bearings, except for
the precision of the inner ring (as machined tolerances).
Careful heat treatment provides a uniform and exact
degree of hardness for maximum life.
The 3000 Series™ bearings are precision ground to 
the same close tolerances on the O.D. as the 1600 Series™ 
with exceptional care given to the ball grooves.  A ball
retainer, or separator, is employed to increase the range of
allowable speeds by reducing ball contact friction.  The
3000 Series™ radial bearing is available open, single or 
doubled shielded, or single or double sealed.  The double
shielded and double sealed versions are grease packed as
standard.  Open and single closure bearings can be 
furnished with or without grease as desired.

Semi-ground 3000 Series™ bearings are specially 
designed to provide a line of economical bearings for
lighter loads than the 1600 Series™ and speeds to approximately 2500 rpm.  The 3000 Series™ bearings are dimensionally the same as the 1600 Series™ bearings, except for
the precision of the inner ring (as machined tolerances).
Careful heat treatment provides a uniform and exact
degree of hardness for maximum life.
The 3000 Series™ bearings are precision ground to 
the same close tolerances on the O.D. as the 1600 Series™ 
with exceptional care given to the ball grooves.  A ball
retainer, or separator, is employed to increase the range of
allowable speeds by reducing ball contact friction.  The
3000 Series™ radial bearing is available open, single or 
doubled shielded, or single or double sealed.  The double
shielded and double sealed versions are grease packed as
standard.  Open and single closure bearings can be 
furnished with or without grease as desired.

The 7500 Series™ bearings are single row retainer
type radial bearings, similar in construction to the 1600
Series™.  They incorporate a highly effective single lip
contact seal, with metal guard. The inner and outer rings
are turned from chrome steel and after careful heat treatment the through hardened rings are accurately ground
to close tolerances.
The 7500 Series™ bearings are recommended for 
applications requiring the accuracy of rotation and quiet
performance of close tolerance precision grade bearings, 
and where a superior seal is required to retain lubricant
and keep the bearing free from dust and dirt.
Normally double sealed (type DL), the 7500 Series™
bearings can be produced to order with seals on one side
only (type SL) or without seals (type NL).  Double sealed
bearings are grease packed as standard; however, all types
can be furnished with or without grease packing as
desired.  All types are provided with a snap ring groove,
with the snap ring assembled on the bearing as an option.

The  400 Series™ of unground radial ball bearings are
designed for moderate loads and speeds where running
accuracy and noise level requirements do not warrant the
more expensive precision ground bearings.  This series of
bearings feature a full ball complement without a retainer
and a soft steel band on the outer ring.  This permits the
bearing to be pressed into a housing without the necessity
of close housing tolerances.   The bearings are designed for
use in applications with speeds not exceeding 1200 rpm.

The 600 Series™ is designed for moderate speeds and
medium thrust loads.  These bearings utilize a full ball 
complement. Rings are cold forged from hardenable strip 
steel and are carefully heat treated.  These bearings may be
plated or manufactured from stainless steel upon request.
The entire assembly is housed in a soft steel band which
lends itself to an easy press fit into a housing.  The band also
serves as a dust shield and helps retain the bearing lubricant.
The upper ring is free to rotate in the band and has a close fit
in the bore for the shaft.  The lower ring is fixed in the band
and has a shaft clearance in the bore.

The methods, equations, and technical data 
presented in this section allow the user to select the
correct bearings and estimate their performance for a
wide range of applications.  These calculations apply
to the Nice® selection of ground and semi-ground 
product lines, namely the 1600™, 3000™, 6900™,
7500™, and 7600 Series™.  For applications with
unusual operating conditions, Nice® can provide
engineering assistance and recommend the most 
suitable bearing design.
Where standard bearings cannot be used, Nice® can
meet the application requirements with a special
bearing design specifically tailored for optimum
performance.  Contact your RBC sales engineer for
special sizes, materials, application requirements,
dimensions, and tolerances.
Capacity and Fatigue Life 
of Ball Bearings
The BASIC DYNAMIC LOAD RATING, C, or  
"dynamic capacity," for a ball bearing is that calculated, constant radial load at which a group of
apparently identical bearings with a stationary outer
ring can statistically endure one million revolutions
of the inner ring.
The BASIC STATIC LOAD RATING, Co, or "static
capacity," is that uniformly distributed load, which
produces a maximum theoretical contact stress on
the most heavily loaded ball of 609,000 psi.  At this
contact stress, a permanent deformation of ball and
raceway occurs.  This deformation is approximately
0.01% of the ball diameter in inches.
The RATING LIFE L10, is a statistical measure of the
life which 90% of a group of apparently identical ball
bearings will achieve or exceed.  For a single bearing
L10 also refers to the life associated with 90% reliability.  Median Life, L50, is the life which 50% of the
group of ball bearings will achieve or exceed.
Median life is usually not greater than five times
the rating life.
The relationship between rating life, load rating and
load is:
L10 = (C/P)3
with
L10 = rating life (106 rev)
= basic load rating (lb)
P
= equivalent radial load (lb)
To obtain the rating life in hours, use:
L10 hrs = 16667/N * (C/P)3
with
N
=  speed (rpm)
The Equivalent Radial Load is defined as:
P
= XFr + YFa
with
Fr= radial load (lb)
Fa= axial load (lb)
X = see table below
Y = see table below
For radial contact ball bearings calculate P with
X = 1.0 and Y=1.0.  Then recalculate P with X =
0.56 and Y from the chart below.  Use the larger
value of P to determine L10 life.

Operating Temperature
Maximum recommended operating temperatures for Nice® ball bearings is a function of the 
bearing cage, seal, and grease materials used in
the final assembly.  For the Nice® standard precision
product series (1600™, 3000™, 7500™, 7600™, ER, 
and 6900™) the maximum recommended operating
temperature is 250°F (121°C).  Operation at temperatures as high as 300°F (149°C) can be tolerated intermittently.  When operating at the extremes of allowable temperatures, grease may purge out between 
the seal lip and the bearing inner ring.  If this is 
unacceptable for a particular application, other
design arrangements might be necessary.
Nice® full complement unground series (400™,
5000™, 500™, and 600™) can operate at higher temperatures than above, and will be limited only by
choice of lubricant.  However, Nice® engineering
should be consulted for application verification.
Limiting Speeds
Limiting operating speed is dependent upon the
materials used in construction and the internal
design and finishing of the bearing.  For the Nice®
standard selection of ball bearings the recommended
speed limits are as follows:
Retainers/Cages
Nice® precision ground ball bearings of standard 
production are fitted with snap-in ball riding retaining cages made from heat stabilized polyamide 6/6.
For special applications or design requirements cages
made of special materials can be supplied.  These
include pressed steel or stainless steel, glass reinforced polyamide 6/6, and brass.  Availability of
bearings fitted with non-standard cages should be
checked before ordering.
Axial Load Capacity
Deep groove ball bearings by nature of their design can
carry axial loads either alone or in combination with
radial loads.  Axial load capacity of standard bearings is
0.5 times the Basic Static Load Rating, CO of that bearing.
Smaller bearings should not be subject to a load greater
than 0.25 times CO.  Excessive axial loads can lead to 
serious reduction of bearing service life.

Misalignment
Radial deep groove ball bearings do have the
ability to accomodate a limited amount of angular
misalignment.  The amount of angular misalignment that can be tolerated before adversely 
effecting bearing performance is a function of a
variety of parameters.  Internal radial clearance,
internal design, applied loads, and the size of the
bearing all play a role in determining the 
bearing's misalignment capability.  Because of 
this, exact values for allowable misalignment are
not provided.  Under normal operating conditions, a safe estimate of permissable angular 
misalignment is usually between .0005 in/in 
(.013 mm/mm) and .003 in/in (.08 mm/mm).
Noise levels may increase when the bearing is
operating misaligned.
Finish and Accuracy
Nice® ball bearings are available in several different
finish and accuracy grades that may be selected to
suit the functionality of a particular application.
Nice® fully ground precision bearings are available
in single row radial configurations.  Boundary dimensions and internal fit-up are held to exacting
tolerances by precision grinding of all external surfaces and both ball grooves.  These bearings are
recommended for applications requiring quiet running, higher speeds, and applied loads.  Normal
tolerances for series 1600™, 7500™, 7600™, and ER
bearings range from .0005" (.013 mm) to .001" (.03
mm).  See product tables for exact tolerances.
Nice® functional precision and unground bearings
are designed for those applications where speeds
and loads are moderate, and running accuracy and
noise requirements do not warrant a fully ground
precision bearing.  Single row radial, single row
angular contact, and thrust ball bearings can be
supplied in semi-ground or unground accuracy.
Series 3000™, 6900™, 400™, 5000™, 500™, and
600™ bearings are available with functional tolerances that range from .005" (.13 mm) to .010" (.25
mm).  See product tables for exact tolerances.

Seals and Shields
Contact seals are used on bearings to prevent solid
contaminants and moisture from entering the bearing while retaining the lubricant in the bearing.  Nice®
design and field experience has resulted in a variety
of heavy duty and effective sealing designs.
The Nice® RS1P seal, which is standard on the
1600™, 3000™, and 6900™ Series Bearings, is made
of oil and wear resistant synthetic rubber with a steel
rein-forcement.  The sealing action is accomplished
via interference (deflection) of the seal lip against a
recess in the inner ring shoulder.  The outside diameter of the seal is retained in a recess groove cut into
the outer ring. The DC seal is an old style multi-part
assembly consisting of a nylon seal insert held in
place with a metal shield.  It is a cost effective seal
used only on a few sizes and specials.  The Nice® DL
and Super Ag seals are special high efficiency contact
seals for heavy duty applications.  They are  constructed of synthetic rubber molded to the back of a
metal shroud or guard.  The seal lip rides in a labyrinth groove for reduced seal drag and lower torque
against the inner ring land surface.
Bearings fitted with non-contacting metal shields are
primarily intended for applications where the inner
ring rotates and low drag torque is a requirement.
They retain the grease at normal operating speeds
and temperatures while protecting the bearing from
contamination. Metal shields are also utilized in
applications where 
contaminants may 
pose a threat to the 
seal materials.

Radial Internal Clearance
All Nice® single row deep groove ball bearings are designed and produced with radial internal clearance to
provide for optimum performance.  Nice® ball bearings are supplied with "normal" radial clearance as standard,
but can be ordered with radial clearance tighter than normal or looser than normal as a special item.  The values
listed in the table below apply to bearings before mounting and under no load and are supplied as a design guide.
Consult Nice® engineering when ordering other than normal radial clearance.
