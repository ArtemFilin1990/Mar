Foreword
Schaeffler Group Industrial is a leading worldwide supplier of rolling 
bearings, spherical plain bearings, plain bearings, linear products, 
accessories specific to bearings and comprehensive maintenance 
products and services. It has approximately 40 000 catalogue 
products manufactured as standard, providing an extremely wide 
portfolio that gives secure coverage of applications from all 
60 designated industrial market sectors.
The central factors responsible for this success are our outstanding 
strength in innovation, our global focus on local customer proximity, 
highly developed manufacturing methods, extremely high quality 
standards in all processes and our ability to transform specific 
customer requirements quickly and accurately into cost-effective 
solutions.  Against this background of expertise, knowledge and 
experience together with our wide range of catalogue items, 
we see ourselves as a high performance, customer focussed partner 
in the development, manufacture and delivery of products.
Research and Development
As a company looking to the future, we are especially active in 
the field of research and development. The key areas in this respect 
include not only research into fundamental principles, materials 
technology, tribology and calculation but also extensive inspection 
and test methods as well as activities to optimise manufacturing 
technology. This is oriented towards ensuring the continuous 
development, improvement and application of our products in 
the long term.
We carry out research and development on a global basis. 
Our development centres are linked with each other worldwide and 
are thus in a position to exchange current information on a very 
short timescale as well as access and communicate the most 
recent data. This ensures that a uniform level of knowledge and 
information is available worldwide.
In addition to continued development of standard products, 
we work closely in research and development activities with our 
customers where specific customer solutions are required. They can 
thus benefit from the best product for their application, with the 
maximum possible performance capacity at a cost-effective price.
Manufacturing technologies,
quality inspections,
environmental protection
“Zero defects” is our quality objective. We have matched all our 
processes to this target. In addition, our many years of experience in 
forming of sheet metal and heavier section material, in vertical and 
horizontal forging, heat treatment, surface technologies, grinding, 
honing and assembly ensures that our products fulfil the required 
quality level.
Ongoing quality inspections are a defined component of the 
manufacturing process. These are integrated directly as a feedback 
function in the manufacturing process. This ensures that all 
products continuously fulfil the same high standard of quality.
We have a highly effective quality management system, 
and the quality of our products and processes is confirmed by 
certification; for example, all manufacturing facilities comply with 
DIN-EN ISO 9001:2000 and ISO/TS 16 949:2002.
With the validation and certification of our manufacturing sites, 
we are taking a pioneering role in environmental protection. 
All larger manufacturing sites are certified not only to ISO 14001, 
but are also validated in accordance with the more stringent 
EC ECO Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).


Foreword
Worldwide presence
Through a closely knit network of development and manufacturing 
sites, sales companies and an international distribution structure, 
we are represented throughout the world. This global presence 
ensures effective linkage between the major markets in Europe, 
India, South East Asia/Pacific Region, East Asia, North and 
South America.
As a result, we have an on-site presence with service and 
technical advice in close proximity to the customer. We take orders 
from throughout the world and make deliveries worldwide too. Our 
distribution network generally has stock of the catalogue products 
relevant to the appropriate markets and company locations and 
can therefore make deliveries within a very short timescale.
Furthermore, we support our customers worldwide in resolving 
their bearing arrangement requirements, respond to technical 
queries and develop specific bearing arrangement solutions in local 
partnership with our customers.
The new
rolling bearing catalogue –
a technical compendium
As an interface between product, complex rolling bearing 
technology and our customers, we can offer not only personal 
consultations by our external sales and application engineering 
functions, but also our technical catalogues in electronic form 
and as paper copy.
Everything in one place
By combining numerous individual catalogues in one overall 
catalogue, we have now concentrated the majority of our rotary 
bearing range in a single printed volume. Even more strongly than 
before, this bundles together our technical knowledge and our 
advisory expertise, for your benefit. In one publication, you can now 
find the required INA and FAG products, both quickly and securely.
The catalogue describes the rolling bearings in accordance with 
DIN/ISO that are required for original equipment manufacture, 
distribution and the aftermarket, specific rolling bearing accessories 
and further rolling bearing types and design variants. 
It is a completely new creation and is significantly different, 
in format as well, from all previous publications from Schaeffler 
Group Industrial.
Find it,
select it,
fit it
This catalogue constitutes a fundamental tool for information 
and advice that will assist you on all issues relating to rolling bearing 
technology. It will show you which products you may be able to use, 
what you need to consider when designing the bearing arrangement, which tolerances are suitable for the adjacent construction 
and how you can achieve the most effective sealing of your bearing 
arrangement. It will also tell you how to calculate the rating life of 
the bearings, what temperatures and loads can be supported, 
which lubricants are most suitable for the bearing arrangement 
and how you should carry out maintenance at the correct times. 
Of course it also describes the correct way to install the products.
Last but not least, this catalogue also promotes dialogue between 
you and us.


Valid for...
The catalogue supersedes the following publications:
■INA Catalogue 307, 
Needle Roller Bearings, Cylindrical Roller Bearings
■INA Catalogue 520, 
Radial Insert Ball Bearings, Housed Bearing Units

Foreword
New product designations
In this catalogue, the designation system of the two brands has 
been harmonised. With this adaptation, we have also created 
a single, common standard for our customers.
The designations are now simpler and the codes are thus more 
transparent. For example, in some designs the seals for track rollers 
have been matched to those for our ball bearings and the P type 
seals have been replaced by radially preloaded seals. The suffix has 
therefore changed from PP to 2RSR and describes the radial preload 
of the contact seals on both sides.
The new prefixes, designations and suffixes are published for 
the first time in this catalogue. Orders submitted using the old 
system will of course continue to be processed very rapidly and 
to your full satisfaction.
maximum customer benefit
through excellent
product quality
X-life is the premium brand of Schaeffler Group Industrial. 
It brings together the strengths of the two brands and opens up 
completely new design opportunities for design engineers. X-life is 
an all-encompassing concept: advice, product development, 
service and sales are fully integrated with each other in all phases 
of the product cycle.  As a service surround system, it includes 
a comprehensive lubrication concept. X-life stands for continuous 
quality improvement and local customer focus applied worldwide.
Advantages of
the 
 grade
The use of state of the art manufacturing technologies has resulted 
in a better, more uniform surface over the whole contact face 
between the rolling elements and raceway. As a result, under 
identical load there is a significant reduction in the stress conditions 
present on the rolling elements and raceway. The improved surface 
quality gives reduced friction and lower bearing temperatures, 
running resistance is lower and less strain is placed on the lubricant.
Thanks to such improvements, the basic dynamic load ratings are 
significantly higher than those of the previous design. As a result, 
the basic rating life is higher; i.e. the operating life of the bearings 
is considerably longer under the same operating conditions. 
Alternatively, higher loads can be applied while maintaining 
the same life values.
With their optimised characteristics, X-life bearings open up 
completely new application prospects, such as downsizing of 
the bearing arrangement. Furthermore, the improved price/
performance ratio ultimately increases the overall cost-effectiveness 
of the bearing arrangement.
X-life bearings are described in the sections on product features and 
are indicated in the dimension tables by the symbol XL.

Schaeffler KG introduced the “Expanded calculation of the adjusted 
rating life” in 1997. This method is standardised in accordance 
with DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1. The method will be incorporated in 
the next version of the international standard ISO 281.
Fatigue theory as a principle
The basis of the rating life calculation in accordance with ISO 281
is Lundberg and Palmgren’s fatigue theory which always gives a final 
rating life.
However, modern, high quality bearings can exceed by 
a considerable margin the values calculated in accordance with 
ISO 281 under favourable operating conditions. Ioannides and 
Harris have developed a further model of fatigue in rolling contact 
that expands on the Lundberg/Palmgren theory and gives a better 
description of the performance capability of modern bearings.
The method “Expanded calculation of the adjusted rating life” takes 
account of the following influences:
■the bearing load
■the fatigue limit of the material
■the extent to which the surfaces are separated by the lubricant
■the cleanliness in the lubrication gap
■additives in the lubricant
■the internal load distribution and frictional conditions in 
the bearing.
The influencing factors, especially those relating to contamination, 
are extremely complex. A great deal of experience is essential for 
an accurate assessment. For further advice, we recommend that you 
consult the engineering service of Schaeffler Group Industrial.
The tables and diagrams can give only guide values.


Dynamic load
carrying capacity and life
The required size of a rolling bearing is dependent on the demands 
made on its:
■load carrying capacity
■rating life
■operational reliability.
The dynamic load carrying capacity is described in terms of the basic 
dynamic load ratings. The basic dynamic load ratings are based on 
DIN ISO 281.
The basic dynamic load ratings for rolling bearings are matched 
to contemporary performance standards and those published in 
previous FAG and INA catalogues.
The fatigue behaviour of the material determines the dynamic load 
carrying capacity of the rolling bearing.
The dynamic load carrying capacity is described in terms of the basic 
dynamic load rating and the basic rating life.
The rating life as a fatigue period depends on:
■the load
■the operating speed
■the statistical probability of the first appearance of failure.
The basic dynamic load rating C applies to rotating rolling bearings. 
It is:
■a constant radial load Cr for radial bearings
■a constant, concentrically acting axial load Ca for axial bearings.
The basic dynamic load rating C is that load of constant magnitude 
and direction which a sufficiently large number of apparently 
identical bearings can endure for a basic rating life of one million 
revolutions.


Calculation of the rating life
The methods for calculating the rating life are:
■the basic rating life to DIN ISO 281, page 34
■the adjusted rating life to DIN ISO 281, page 35
■the expanded adjusted rating life to DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1, 
page 38.
Basic rating life
The basic rating life L and Lh is determined using the following 
formulae:
106 revolutions
The basic rating life in millions of revolutions is the life reached or exceeded 
by 90% of a sufficiently large group of apparently identical bearings before 
the first evidence of material fatigue develops

The equivalent dynamic load P is a calculated value. This value is 
constant in size and direction; it is a radial load for radial bearings 
and an axial load for axial bearings.
P gives the same rating life as the combined load occurring in 
practice.

Reference viscosity of the lubricant at operating temperature.
The reference viscosity 1 is determined from the mean bearing 
diameter dM = (D + d)/2 and the operating speed n, 
Figure 2, Reference viscosity 1, page 37.
The nominal vicosity of the oil at +40 °C is determined from 
the required operating viscosity  and the operating temperature , 
Figure 3, V/T diagram for mineral oils, page 37. In the case of 
greases,  is the operating viscosity of the base oil.
In the case of heavily loaded bearings with a high proportion of 
sliding contact, the temperature in the contact area of the rolling 
elements may be up to 20 K higher than the temperature measured 
on the stationary ring (without the influence of any external heat).

■the type of bearing
■the residual stress in the material
■the environmental conditions
■contamination in the lubricant.

This calculation method cannot be used for   0,1.
Taking account of EP additives
DIN ISO 281, Appendix 1, describes how EP additives are taken into 
consideration. For a viscosity ratio   1 and a contamination 
factor eC  0,2, calculation can be carried out using the value  = 1 
for lubricants with EP additives that have been proven effective. 
With severe contamination (contamination factor eC  0,2), the 
effectiveness of the additives under these contamination conditions 
must be proven. The effectiveness of the EP additives can be 
demonstrated in the actual application or on a rolling bearing test 
rig FE 8 to DIN 51819-1.
If the EP additives are proven effective and calculation is carried out 
using the value  = 1, the life adjustment factor must be restricted 
to aDIN 	 3. If the calculated value aDIN for the actual  is greater 
than 3, this value can be used in calculation.

Fatigue limit load
The fatigue limit load Cu is defined as the load below which 
– under laboratory conditions – no fatigue occurs in the material.
Life adjustment factor
for contamination
The life adjustment factor for contamination eC takes into 
consideration the influence of contamination in the lubrication gap 
on the rating life, table Factor eC.
The rating life is reduced by solid particles in the lubrication gap and 
is dependent on:
■the type, size, hardness and number of particles
■the relative lubrication film thickness
■the bearing size.
Due to the complex nature of the interaction between these 
influencing factors, only an approximate guide value can be 
attained. The values in the tables are valid for contamination by 
solid particles, table Factor eC. They do not take account of other 
contamination such as that caused by water or other fluids.
Under severe contamination – eC → 0 – 
the bearings may fail due to wear.
In this case, the operating life is substantially less than 
the calculated life.

Equivalent operating values
The rating life formulae are based on the assumption that 
the bearing load P and bearing speed n are constant.
If the load and speed are not constant, equivalent operating values 
can be determined that induce the same fatigue as the actual 
conditions.
The equivalent operating values calculated here already take 
account of the life adjustment factors a3 or aDIN. They must not be 
applied again when calculating the adjusted rating life.
Variable load and speed
If the load and speed vary over a time period T, the speed n and 
equivalent bearing load P are calculated as follows:
Variation in steps
If the load and speed vary in steps over a time period T, the speed n 
and equivalent bearing load P are calculated as follows:
Variable load at constant speed
If the function F describes the variation in the load over the time 
period T and the speed is constant, the equivalent bearing load P 
is calculated as follows:
Load varying in steps and
constant speed
If the load varies in steps over a time period T and the speed 
is constant, the equivalent bearing load P is calculated as follows:

Required rating life
If no information is available on the required rating life, the guide 
values from the following tables may be used.
Do not overspecify the bearing. If the calculated life is greater 
than 60 000 h, this normally means that the bearing arrangement is 
overspecified.

Operating life
The operating life is the life actually achieved by a rolling bearing. 
It may differ significantly from the calculated life.
This may be due to wear or fatigue as a result of:
■deviating operating conditions
■misalignment between the shaft and housing
■insufficient or excessive operating clearance
■contamination
■insufficient lubrication
■excessive operating temperature
■oscillating bearing motion with very small angles of oscillation 
– false brinelling
■high vibration and false brinelling
■very high shock loads – leading to static overloading
■prior damage during installation.
Due to the wide variety of possible installation and operating 
conditions, it is not possible to precisely predetermine the operating 
life. The most reliable way of arriving at a close estimate is by 
comparison with similar applications.

Axial load carrying capacity
of cylindrical roller bearings
Radial cylindrical roller bearings used as semi-locating and 
locating bearings can support axial forces in one or both directions 
in addition to radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on:
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height, 
Figure 9.
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support at the rib. Special analysis is required in 
this case.
The limiting load Fa max must not be exceeded, in order to avoid 
unacceptable pressure at the contact surfaces. Calculation of axial 
load: see page 49.
The ratio Fa/Fr must not exceed a value of 0,4.
Continuous axial loading without simultaneous radial loading is not 
permissible.

Static load carrying capacity
Very high static loads or shock loads can cause plastic deformation 
on the raceways and rolling elements. This deformation limits 
the static load carrying capacity of the rolling bearing with respect to 
the permissible noise level during running.
If a rolling bearing operates without rotary motion or with only 
infrequent rotary motion, its size is determined in accordance with 
the basic static load rating C0.
According to DIN ISO 76, this is:
■a constant radial load C0r for radial bearings
■a constant, concentrically acting axial load C0a for axial bearings.
The basic static load rating C0 is that load under which 
the Hertzian pressure at the most heavily loaded point between 
the rolling elements and raceways reaches the following values: 
■for roller bearings, 4 000 N/mm2
■for ball bearings, 4 200 N/mm2
■for self-aligning ball bearings, 4 600 N/mm2.
Under normal contact conditions, this load causes a permanent 
deformation at the contact points of approx. 1/10 000 of the rolling 
element diameter.


Static load safety factor
The static load safety factor S0 is the ratio between the basic static 
load rating C0 and the equivalent static load P0:

Equivalent static load
The equivalent static load P0 is a calculated value. 
It corresponds to a radial load in radial bearings and a concentric 
axial load in axial bearings. 
P0 induces the same load at the centre point of the most heavily 
loaded contact point between the rolling element and raceway as 
the combined load occurring in practice.

Rigidity
The rigidity of a rolling bearing is dependent on the bearing type, 
size and operating clearance. 
The rigidity increases with the number of rolling elements 
supporting the load.
Rolling bearings with line contact have a higher rigidity than rolling 
bearings with point contact, Figure 1.
Deflection
Rolling bearings have a progressive deflection rate. 
The displacement values can be determined using approximation 
formulae.
The formulae are valid for bearings without misalignment and 
with a rigid surrounding structure.
In axial bearings, a concentrically acting load is assumed.

Friction and increases in temperature
Friction
The friction in a rolling bearing is made up of several components, 
see table Frictional component and influencing factor. Due to 
the large number of influencing factors, the frictional torque and 
thus the frictional energy can only be calculated in approximate 
terms and on the precondition of constant operating conditions.
Frictional component
and influencing factor
The idling friction is dependent on:
■the quantity of lubricant
■the speed
■the operating viscosity of the lubricant
■the seals
■the running-in condition of the bearing.
Heat dissipation
Friction is converted into heat; this heat is dissipated from 
the bearing. The equilibrium between the frictional energy and 
heat dissipation allows calculation of the thermally permissible 
speed nper, see Speeds, page 62.
Heat dissipation
by the lubricant
If oil lubrication is used, a portion of the heat is dissipated by the oil: 
recirculating oil lubrication with additional cooling is particularly 
effective.
Grease does not give dissipation of heat.
Heat dissipation
via the shaft and housing
Heat dissipation via the shaft and housing is dependent on the 
temperature difference between the bearing and the surrounding 
structure, Figure 1.
Any additional adjacent sources of heat or thermal radiation must be 
taken into consideration.

Calculation of friction values
In order to determine the friction values, the speed and load must be 
known. The type of lubrication, lubrication method and viscosity of 
lubricant at operating temperature are further important factors in 
calculation.

Friction and increases in temperature
The bearing factors f0 and f1 are mean values determined from 
series of tests and corresponding data according to ISO 15 312.
They are valid for grease lubrication applied to fitted bearings. 
In the freshly greased state, the bearing factor f0 may be higher by 
a factor of between two and five.
If oil mist lubrication is used, a marginal lubricant supply is 
assumed.
If oil bath lubrication is used, the oil level must reach the centre 
of the lowest rolling element. If the oil level is higher, f0 may be up 
to 3 times the value given in the table, Figure 2.

On the basis of DIN 732-1, calculation of the thermal reference 
speed nB has been standardised in ISO 15312. The calculation of 
reference speeds was matched to this standard, giving modified 
values compared to the previous catalogue data.
The symbols used in the formulae have been matched to 
the international standard.
Thermal reference speed
The thermal reference speed nB is used as an auxiliary quantity 
for calculating the thermally safe operating speed nper. 
This is the speed at which, under defined reference conditions, 
a bearing operating temperature of +70 °C is achieved. 
Reference conditions
The reference conditions are based on the usual operating 
conditions of the most significant bearing types and sizes.
They are defined as follows in ISO 15 312:
■mean ambient temperature Ar = +20 °C
■mean bearing temperature at the outer ring r = +70 °C
■load on radial bearings: P1r = 0,05 · C0r
■load on axial bearings: P1a = 0,02 · C0a
■operating viscosities:
These are selected for radial bearings such that similar reference 
speeds are achieved for both oil and grease lubrication
– radial bearings: 12 mm2s–1 (ISO VG 32)
– axial bearings: 24 mm2s–1 (ISO VG 68)
■heat dissipation through the bearing seating surfaces in 
accordance with the following formulae:
for radial bearings, bearing seat Ar 	 50 000 mm2
for radial bearings, bearing seat Ar  50 000 mm2
for axial bearings, bearing seat Ar 	 50 000 mm2
for axial bearings, bearing seat Ar  50 000 mm2
The limiting speed nG  is based on practical experience. 
It takes account of additional criteria such as smooth running, 
sealing function and centrifugal forces.
The limiting speed must not be exceeded even under favourable 
operating and cooling conditions.

Thermally safe
operating speed
The thermally safe operating speed nper is calculated according 
to DIN 732-2 (draft). Calculation is based on the heat balance in 
the bearing, the equilibrium between frictional energy as a function 
of speed and heat dissipation as a function of temperature. 
When equilibrium is present, the bearing temperature is constant.
The permissible operating temperature determines the thermally 
safe operating speed nper of the bearing. The preconditions for 
calculation are correct fitting, normal operating clearance and 
constant operating conditions.
The calculation method is not valid for:
■sealed bearings with contact seals, since the maximum speed is 
restricted by the permissible sliding speed at the seal lip
■yoke and stud type track rollers
■aligning needle roller bearings
■axial deep groove and axial angular contact ball bearings.
Calculation of the thermally
safe operating speed
The thermally safe operating speed nper is the product of 
the reference speed nB and the speed ratio fn:
The limiting speed must be observed.
The speed ratio is derived from Figure 1, page 64:
In the normal range 0,01  kL  10 and 0,01  kP  10,

Principles
Lubrication and maintenance are important for the reliable 
operation and long operating life of rolling bearings.
Functions of the lubricant
The lubricant should, Figure 1:
■form a lubricant film on the contact surfaces that is sufficiently 
capable of supporting loads and thus preventing wear and 
premature fatigue 
■dissipate heat in the case of oil lubrication 
■give additional sealing of the bearing, in the case of grease 
lubrication, against the entry of both solid and fluid 
contaminants 
■reduce the running noise 
■protect the bearing against corrosion .
Selection of
the type of lubrication
It should be determined as early as possible in the design process 
whether bearings should be lubricated using grease or oil.
The following factors are decisive in determining the type of 
lubrication and quantity of lubricant:
■the operating conditions
■the type and size of the bearing
■the adjacent construction
■the lubricant feed.
Criteria for grease lubrication
In the case of grease lubrication, the following criteria must be 
considered:
■very little design work required
■sealing action
■reservoir effect
■long operating life with little maintenance work 
(“for life” lubrication possible in certain circumstances)
■if relubrication is required, it may be necessary to provide 
collection areas for old grease and feed ducts
■no heat dissipation by the lubricant
■no rinsing out of wear debris and other particles.

Criteria for oil lubrication
In the case of oil lubrication, the following criteria must be 
considered:
■good lubricant distribution and supply to contact areas
■dissipation of heat possible from the bearing 
(significant principally at high speeds and/or loads)
■rinsing out of wear debris
■very low friction losses with minimal quantity lubrication
■more work required on feed and sealing.
Under extreme operating conditions (such as very high 
temperatures, vacuum, aggressive media), it may be possible to use 
special lubrication methods such as solid lubricants in consultation 
with the engineering service.
Design of lubricant feed
When designing feed lines and lubrication holes in the housings 
and shafts, Figure 2 and Figure 3:
■these should lead directly to the lubrication hole in the rolling 
■they should be as short as possible
■an individual feed should be provided for each bearing.
Ensure that the feeds are filled, Figure 2; the feed line should be 
bled if necessary.
Follow the instructions provided by the lubrication device 
manufacturer.

Grease lubrication
Greases can be differentiated in terms of their thickeners and 
base oils. The base oils of greases are covered by the information in 
the section “Oil lubrication”, page 83.
Composition of a grease
Conventional greases have metal soaps as thickeners and a mineral 
base oil.
They also contain additives. These have a specific influence on, 
for example, the characteristics in relation to wear prevention, 
corrosion prevention or resistance to ageing. These combinations of 
additives are not, however, fully effective across every temperature 
and load range.
Greases exhibit widely varying behaviour in response to 
environmental influences such as temperature and moisture.
Lubricants should be checked for their compatibility with:
■other lubricants
■anti-corrosion agents
■thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers
■light and non-ferrous metals
■coatings
■colouring agents and paints
■the environment.
When considering compatibility with the environment, 
attention must be paid to toxicity, biodegradability and 
water pollution class.

 Additives
 Base oil
 Grease

Type of grease
The characteristics of a grease are dependent on:
■the base oil
■the viscosity of the base oil 
(this is important for the speed range)
■the thickener 
(the shear strength is significant for the speed range)
■the additives.
Consistency of greases
Greases are subdivided into consistency classes – NLGI classes– 
(DIN 51 818). For rolling bearings, classes 1, 2 or 3 should be used 
in preference, Figure 5.
Selection of suitable grease
Rolling bearing greases K to DIN 51 825 are suitable.
Suitable greases should be selected in accordance with 
the operating conditions of the bearing:
■temperature
■compressive load
■speed
■the presence of water/moisture.
Operating temperature range
The operating temperature range of the grease must correspond to 
the range of possible operating temperatures in the rolling bearing.
Grease manufacturers indicate an operating temperature range for 
their rolling bearing greases K in accordance with DIN 51 825.
The upper value is determined in accordance with DIN 51 821 by 
means of testing using the FAG rolling bearing grease test rig FE 9. 
At the upper operating temperature, a 50% failure probability (F50) 
of at least 100 hours must be achieved in this test.
The lower value is defined in accordance with DIN 51 825 by means 
of flow pressure. The flow pressure of a grease is the pressure 
required to press a stream of grease through a defined nozzle.
For greases of type K, the flow pressure at the lower operating 
temperature must be less than 1400 mbar.

The use of flow pressure in determining the lower operating 
temperature only indicates, however, whether the grease can be 
moved at this temperature. This cannot be used to give an indication 
of its suitability for use in rolling bearings at low temperatures.
In addition to the lower operating temperature of a grease, therefore, 
the low temperature frictional torque is also determined in 
accordance with ASTM D 1478 or IP 186/93. At the lower operating 
temperature, the starting torque must not exceed 1000 Nmm and 
the running torque must not exceed 100 Nmm.
Schaeffler Group Industrial recommends that greases should be 
used in accordance with the bearing temperature normally occurring 
in the standard operating range in order to achieve a reliable 
lubricating action and an acceptable grease operating life, Figure 6.
At low temperatures, greases release very little base oil. This can 
result in lubricant starvation. Schaeffler Group Industrial therefore 
recommends that greases are not used below the lower continuous 
limit temperature Tlowerlimit, Figure 6. This is approx. 20 K above 
the lower operating temperature of the grease as indicated by 
the grease manufacturer.
The upper continuous limit temperature Tupperlimit must not be 
exceeded if a reduction in the grease operating life due to 
temperature is to be avoided. See the section Grease operating life, 
page 74.
At consistently low temperatures (for example in cold store 
applications), it must be ensured that the grease releases sufficient 
oil in relation to the bearing type.

Pressure properties
The viscosity at operating temperature must be sufficiently high 
for the formation of a lubricant film capable of supporting loads.
At high loads, greases with EP characteristics – “extreme pressure” 
– and high base oil viscosity should be used (KP grease to 
DIN 51 825). Such greases should also be used for bearings with 
substantial sliding or line contact.
Silicone greases should only be used at low loads (P 	 3% C).
Greases with solid lubricants should preferably be used for 
applications with mixed or boundary friction conditions.
The solid lubricant particle size must not exceed 5 m.
Speed
Grease should be selected in accordance with the speed 
parameter n · dM for grease (see table, page 72 and page 73):
■For rolling bearings running at high speeds or with a low starting 
torque, greases with a high speed parameter should be used.
■For bearings running at low speeds, greases with a low speed 
parameter should be used.
Under centrifugal acceleration greater than 500 g, separation 
(of the thickener and base oil) may occur. In this case, please consult 
the lubricant manufacturer.
The consistency of polycarbamide greases can be altered by shear 
stresses to a greater extent than that of metal soap greases.
Water/moisture
Water in the grease has a highly detrimental effect on the operating 
life of the bearing:
■the static behaviour of greases in the presence of water is 
assessed in accordance with DIN 51 807, see Figure 7
■the anti-corrosion characteristics can be tested according to 
DIN 51 802 (Emcor test) – information is given in the grease 
manufacturer’s data sheets.

Grease operating life
The grease operating life tfG is the decisive value if it is less than 
the calculated bearing life. It applies if rolling bearings cannot be 
relubricated.

Guidelines on calculating
the grease operating life
Combined rolling bearings
The radial and axial bearing components must be calculated 
separately – the decisive value is the shorter grease operating life.
Rotating outer ring
If the outer ring rotates, there may be a reduction in the grease 
operating life.
In the case of yoke and stud type track rollers:
■angular misalignment must be zero
■the effect of the rotating outer ring on the grease operating life is 
taken into consideration in the bearing type factor kf.
Restrictions
The grease operating life cannot be determined using the above 
method:
■if the grease can flow out of the rolling bearing
– there is excessive evaporation of the base oil
– in bearings without seals
– in axial bearings with a horizontal axis of rotation
■if air is sucked into the rolling bearing during operation
– this can cause the grease to oxidise
■in combined rotary and linear motion
– the grease is distributed over the whole stroke length
■if contamination, water or other fluids enter the bearings
■for spindle bearings
■for drawn cup roller clutches
■for screw drive bearings
■for high precision bearings for combined loads.
The additional guidelines on lubrication in the product sections 
must be observed.


Correction factors for determining
the grease operating life
Temperature factor KT
If the bearing temperature is higher than the continuous limit 
temperature Tupperlimit, KT must be calculated from the diagram, 
Figure 9.
The diagram should not be used if the bearing temperature 
is higher than the upper operating temperature of the grease used, 
see table Greases, page 72.
If necessary, select a different grease and/or consult 
the engineering service.

Oscillation factor KR
Oscillating motion places a greater strain on the grease than does 
rotating motion.
In order to reduce fretting corrosion, the lubrication interval should 
be reduced.
If the rolling elements do not undergo a complete revolution, 
please consult the engineering service.
The factor KR applies for an angle of oscillation  of  180°, 
Figure 11 and Figure 12.
Environmental factor KU
The environmental factor KU takes account of the influences of 
moisture, shaking forces, slight vibration (leading to fretting 
corrosion) and shocks, see table Environmental factor KU.
The environmental factor KU does not take account of extreme 
environmental influences such as water, aggressive media, 
contamination, radiation and extreme vibrations such as those 
occurring in vibratory machines.
In relation to contamination, attention should also be paid to 
the section Influence of contamination on life calculation.

Factor KS for vertical shafts
If increased escape of grease is expected, for example in radial 
bearings with a vertical axis of rotation, the factor according to 
the table Factor KS for vertical shafts must be applied.
Factor KS for vertical shafts
Relubrication intervals
For rolling bearings that are relubricated, attention must be paid 
to the lubrication interval in order to ensure reliable function of 
the bearings.
The precise lubrication interval should be determined by tests 
conducted under application conditions:
■sufficiently long observation periods must be used
■the condition of the grease must be checked at regular intervals.
In most applications, experience has shown that the guide value is:
tfR
Guide value for relubrication interval
tfG
Guide value for grease operating life.
Conditions
The grease should be the same as that used for initial greasing.
If different greases are used, their miscibility and compatibility 
should be checked.
Relubrication should be carried out:
■with the bearing still warm from operation and rotating if safe to 
do so
■before the bearing comes to rest if safe to do so
■before extended breaks in operation.
Relubrication quantity
Due to the compact construction of INA/FAG bearings, 
we recommend that relubrication should be carried out using 
50% to 80% of the initial greasing quantity.
If feed lines filled with air are present, the filling volume of the feed 
lines should be included in calculation of the relubrication quantity.
Relubrication
Regreasing should continue until a fresh collar of grease appears 
at the seal gaps. Old grease must be able to leave the bearing 
unhindered.

Otherwise

The initial greasing quantity is between 30% and 100% of 
the available volume in the bearing, dependent on the bearing type 
and operating conditions.
A grease reservoir can extend the grease operating life. The grease 
in the reservoir must be in constant contact with the grease on the 
raceway. The grease operating life does not increase proportionally 
with the size of the grease reservoir.
The volume of the grease reservoir should correspond to the area 
in the bearing between the inner and outer ring (not taking account 
of the cage and rolling elements), Figure 13 and Figure 14.
Evaporation of the base oil should be prevented by design 
measures, for example by sealing shields, Figure 13 and Figure 14.

Miscibility
Mixing of greases should be avoided if at all possible.
If mixing of greases is unavoidable, the following preconditions 
must be fulfilled:
■same base oil
■compatible thickener types
■similar base oil viscosities – 
differing by no more than one ISO VG class
■same consistency – NLGI class.
Consult the grease manufacturer.
Even if these preconditions are fulfilled, impairment of 
the performance capability of the mixed grease cannot be ruled out.
If a conscious decision is taken to change to a different grease grade, 
the grease should be rinsed out if this is permitted by the design of 
the mounting location. Further relubrication should be carried out 
after a shortened period.
If incompatible greases are mixed this may lead to substantial 
structural changes and even to a substantial softening of the mixed 
grease.
Definite statements on miscibility can only be obtained by means of 
suitable tests.
Storage
Experience shows that the greases used can be stored for up to 
3 years.
The preconditions are:
■a closed room or store
■temperatures between 0 °C and + 40 °C
■relative humidity no more than 65%
■no influence of chemical agents – vapours, gases, fluids
■the bearings are sealed.
Lubricants age due to environmental influences. The information 
provided by the lubricant manufacturer should be adhered to.
After long periods of storage, the start-up frictional torque of 
greased bearings can be temporarily higher than normal. 
The lubricity of the grease may also have deteriorated.
Since the lubrication characteristics of greases vary and different 
raw materials may be used for greases of the same name as a result 
of globalisation, we cannot offer any guarantees either for 
the lubricants used by customers for relubrication or for their 
characteristics in operation.


Oil lubrication
For the lubrication of rolling bearings, mineral oils and synthetic oils 
are essentially suitable. Oils with a mineral oil base are used most 
frequently. They must fulfil at least the requirements according to 
DIN 51 517 or DIN 51 524. 
Special oils, often synthetic oils, are used under extreme operating 
conditions or where there are special requirements relating to 
oil resistance. 
In thes cases, please consult the lubricant manufacturer or 
our engineering service.
Operating temperatures
The information provided by the lubricant manufacturer should be 
taken as authoritative.
Selection of suitable oil
The achievable life and security against wear are higher with better 
separation of the contact surfaces by a lubricant film, Figure 15 and 
section Load carrying capacity and life.

Reference viscosity for mineral oils
The guide value for 1 is dependent on:
■the mean bearing diameter dM and the speed n.
The guide value 1 takes account of:
■the EHD theory on the formation of a lubricant film
■practical experience.
Depending on the operating speed, the oil at operating temperature 
must have at least the reference viscosity 1, Figure 16.
Calculation of reference viscosity
Calculate the reference viscosity 1 in accordance with the example, 
Figure 16:
■Assign 1 to a nominal viscosity 
with ISO VG between 10 and 1500
– centre point viscosity to DIN 51 519
■Round intermediate values should be rounded to 
the nearest ISO VG
– due to the steps between the groups.
This method cannot be used for synthetic oils, since these have 
different viscosity/pressure and viscosity/temperature 
characteristics.
Please consult our engineering service.

Influence of
temperature on viscosity
As the temperature increases, the viscosity of the oil decreases. 
This temperature-dependent change in the viscosity is described 
using the viscosity index VI. For mineral oils, this VI should be at 
least 95.
When selecting the viscosity, the lower operating temperature must 
be taken into consideration:
■increasing viscosity restricts the flow behaviour of the lubricant 
and leads to increased power losses.
Very long life can be achieved with a viscosity ratio  = /1 = 3 to 4 
( = operating viscosity). Highly viscous oils do not, however, 
bring only advantages. In addition to the aforementioned power 
losses due to lubrication friction, there may be problems with 
the feed and removal of oil at low or even at normal temperatures.
The oil must therefore be selected to be sufficiently viscous that the 
longest possible fatigue life is achieved while ensuring satisfactory 
supply of oil to the bearings at all times.
Pressure properties of oil
If the bearings are subjected to high loads or the operating viscosity 
 is less than the reference viscosity 1, oils with anti-wear additives 
(type P to DIN 51 502) should be used.
Such oils are also necessary for types of rolling bearings with 
a substantial proportion of sliding contact (for example bearings 
with line contact).
These additives form boundary layers to reduce the harmful effects 
of metallic contact occurring at various areas (wear).
The suitability of these additives varies and is normally heavily 
dependent on temperature. Their effectiveness can only be 
assessed by means of testing in the rolling bearing 
(for example on our test rig FE8 in accordance with DIN 51 819).
Silicone oils should only be used for low loads (P 	 3% C).
Compatibility
Before oils are used, their behaviour must be checked in relation 
to plastics, seal materials (elastomers) and light and non-ferrous 
metals.
This must be checked under dynamic conditions and at operating 
temperature.
Synthetic oils must always be checked for their compatibility and 
the lubricant manufacturer must be consulted.
Miscibility
Mixing of different oils should be avoided wherever possible. 
In particular, the presence of different additive packages may lead to 
undesirable interactions.
In general, oils with a mineral oil base and the same classification 
are miscible, for example two oils both of type HLP can be mixed.
The viscosities should vary by no more than one ISO VG class.
Synthetic oils must always be checked for their compatibility and 
the lubricant manufacturer must be consulted.
Miscibility must be checked in advance for each individual case.


Cleanliness
The cleanliness of the oil influences the rating life of bearings, 
see section Expanded adjusted rating life.
Recommendation:
■An oil filter should be provided and attention should be paid to 
the filtration rate (recommended filter mesh  25 m).
Lubrication methods
A distinction can essentially be drawn between the following 
methods:
■drip feed oil lubrication
■pneumatic oil lubrication
– in order to protect the environment, this should be used as 
a substitute for oil mist lubrication
■oil bath lubrication
– splash or sump lubrication
■recirculating oil lubrication.
Drip feed oil lubrication
This method is suitable for bearings running at high speeds, 
Figure 17.
The oil quantity required is dependent on the type and size of 
bearing, the operating speed and the load.
The guide value is between 3 drops/min and 50 drops/min for each 
rolling element raceway (one drop weighs approx. 0,025 g).
Excess oil must be allowed to flow out of the bearing arrangement.
Figure 17
Drip feed lubrication –
schematic
155 188b


Pneumatic oil lubrication
This method is particularly suitable for radial bearings running 
at high speeds and under low loads (n · dM = 800 000 to 
3 000 000 min–1 · mm). Parameters for designing the equipment 
should be requested from the lubrication device manufacturer, 
Figure 18.
With a pneumatic oil lubrication system designed for minimal 
quantity lubrication, low frictional torque and a low operating 
temperature can be achieved.
Clean compressed air free from moisture feeds oil to the bearing. 
This generates an excess pressure. This prevents contaminants from 
entering the bearing.
Pneumatic oil lubrication has little cooling effect.
Pneumatic oil lubrication of axial bearings should be avoided if 
possible.
The oil quantity required for adequate supply is dependent on 
the bearing type.
Follow the instructions provided by the lubrication device 
manufacturer.
 To the pneumatic oil unit
Figure 18
Pneumatic oil lubrication –

155 189b


Oil bath lubrication
The oil level should reach the centre line of the lowest rolling 
element, Figure 19. If the oil level is higher than this, the bearing 
temperature may increase at high circumferential speeds and losses 
due to splashing may occur. Furthermore, foaming of the oil may 
occur.
In general, the method is suitable up to 
n · dM = 300 000 min–1 · mm.
At n · dM   150 000 min–1 · mm, the bearing may be fully 
immersed.
In bearings with an asymmetrical cross-section, oil return ducts 
must be provided due to the pumping effect so that recirculation can 
be achieved.
In axial bearings, the oil level must cover the inside diameter of 
the axial cage.
The oil quantity in the housing must be adequately proportioned, 
otherwise very short oil change intervals will be necessary.
Figure 19
Oil bath lubrication –
schematic
155 184b


Recirculating oil lubrication
In recirculating oil lubrication, the oil is subjected to additional 
cooling, Figure 20. The oil can therefore dissipate heat from 
the bearing. The quantity of oil required for heat dissipation is 
dependent on the cooling conditions, see section Speeds.
The oil quantities V are matched to the operating conditions, 
Figure 21. The diagram indicates oil quantities that can be fed 
through the bearing without pressure with a side feed arrangement 
and banking up to the lower edge of the shaft.
For bearings with an asymmetrical cross-section (such as angular 
contact ball bearings, tapered roller bearings, axial spherical roller 
bearings), larger throughput quantities are permissible due to the 
pumping effect than for bearings with a symmetrical cross-section. 
Large quantities can be used to dissipate wear debris or heat.

Design of adjacent construction
for oil lubrication
The lubrication holes in the housing and shaft must align with those 
in the rolling bearings.
Adequate cross-sections must be provided for annular slots, 
pockets, etc.
The oil must be able to flow out without pressure 
(this prevents oil build-up and additional heating of the oil).
In axial bearings, the oil must always be fed from the inside to 
the outside.
Outlet cross-section –
guide values for oil lubrication
The cross-section of the oil outlet hole should be significantly larger 
than that of the inlet, Figure 22.

Oil injection lubrication
In bearings running at high speeds, the oil is injected into the gap 
between the cage and bearing ring. Injection lubrication using large 
recirculation quantities is associated with high power loss, 
Figure 23.
Heating of the bearings can only be held within limits with 
a considerable amount of effort. The appropriate upper limit for the 
speed parameter n · dM = 1 000 000 min–1 · mm for recirculating 
lubrication with suitable bearings (for example spindle bearings) 
can be exceeded to a considerable degree when using injection 
lubrication.

Oil changes
In general, an annual oil change is sufficient for temperatures in 
the bearing of less than +50 °C and low levels of contamination.
Severe operating conditions
Under severe conditions, the oil should be changed more frequently.
This applies, for example, in the case of higher temperatures and 
low oil quantities with high recirculation frequencies.
The recirculation frequency indicates how often the entire oil volume 
available is recirculated and pumped per hour:
The precise oil change intervals should be determined with 
the assistance of the oil manufacturer.
Guide values for oil change intervals are given in Figure 25.

Arcanol –
rolling bearing greases
In co-operation with renowned lubricant manufacturers, 
Schaeffler Group Industrial has developed lubricating greases that 
are particularly suitable for rolling bearings. The greases in the 
Arcanol range are tested on the lubricant test rigs FE8 (DIN 51 819) 
and FE9 (DIN 51 821) in rolling bearings in relation to life, 
friction, wear and temperature suitability.
Every grease batch in the Arcanol range is subjected to goods inward 
inspection in order to ensure consistent quality.
The greases in the range are arranged in grades in terms of their 
performance capability such that almost all areas of application 
are covered, see table Arcanol rolling bearing greases.

The radial internal clearance applies to bearings with an inner ring 
before the bearing is fitted. It is defined as the amount by which 
the inner ring can be moved in a radial direction from one extreme 
position to the other in relation to the outer ring, Figure 1.
The radial internal clearance is subdivided into groups according to 
DIN 620 and ISO 5 753, see table Radial internal clearance groups. 
The values for the radial internal clearance are given in DIN 620-4, 
ISO 5 753 and in the Features section of the product description.
Radial internal clearance groups
1) Internal clearance group values: see also product sections.
Enveloping circle
In bearings without inner ring, the enveloping circle value Fw is used. 
This is the inner inscribed circle of the needle rollers in clearancefree contact with the outer raceway, Figure 2. For unfitted bearings, 
it is in tolerance zone F6 (except for drawn cup needle roller 
bearings).

Operating clearance
The operating clearance is determined on a fitted bearing still 
warm from operation. It is defined as the amount by which the shaft 
can be moved in a radial direction from one extreme position to 
the other, Figure 3.
The operating clearance is derived from the radial internal clearance 
and the change in the radial internal clearance as a result of 
interference fit and thermal influences in the fitted condition.
Operating clearance value
The operating clearance value is dependent on the operating and 
installation conditions of the bearing.
A larger operating clearance is necessary, for example, if heat 
is transferred via the shaft, the shaft undergoes deflection or 
if misalignment occurs.
An operating clearance smaller than CN should only be used in 
special cases, for example in high precision bearing arrangements.
The normal operating clearance is achieved with internal 
clearance CN or, in larger bearings, predominantly with C3 if 
the recommended shaft and housing tolerances are fulfilled, 
see section Design of bearing arrangements, page 125.
Please observe the design guidelines in the section Design of 
bearing arrangements.

Reduction in radial internal
clearance due to fit
The radial internal clearance is reduced due to the fit as a result of 
expansion of the inner ring and contraction of the outer ring:

Expansion of the inner ring

Contraction of the outer ring.
Expansion of the inner ring
The expansion of the inner ring is calculated as follows:
Bore diameter of the inner ring
Theoretical interference of the fitted parts with firm seating
The theoretical interference is determined from: 
the mean deviations and the upper and lower deviations of the tolerance zones 
of the fitted parts reduced by 1/3 of their acceptable value. This must be reduced 
by the amount by which parts are smoothed during fitting
Raceway diameter of the inner ring.
For very thin-walled housings and light metal housings, 
the reduction in the radial internal clearance must be determined by 
mounting trials.
Contraction of the outer ring
The expansion of the inner ring is calculated as follows:
Raceway diameter of the outer ring
Outside diameter of the outer ring.
Reduction in the radial internal
clearance due to temperature
The radial internal clearance can alter considerably if there is 
a substantial temperature differential between the inner and outer 
ring.

Bearing materials
INA and FAG rolling bearings fulfil the requirements for fatigue 
strength, wear resistance, hardness, toughness and structural 
stability.
The material used for the rings and rolling elements is generally 
a low alloy, through hardening chromium steel of high purity. 
For bearings subjected to considerable shock loads and 
reversed bending stresses, case hardening steel is also used 
(supplied by agreement).
In recent years, the improved quality of rolling bearing steels 
has been the principal factor in achieving considerable increases 
in basic load ratings. 
The results of research as well as practical experience confirm 
that bearings made from the steel currently used as standard can 
achieve their endurance limit if loads are not excessively high and 
the lubrication and cleanliness conditions are favourable.
High Nitrogen Steel
Through the use of special bearings made from HNS (High Nitrogen 
Steel, supplied by agreement), it is possible to achieve 
adequate service life even under the most challenging conditions 
(high temperatures, moisture, contamination).
Ceramic materials
Ceramic hybrid spindle bearings contain balls made from silicon 
nitride. These ceramic balls are substantially lighter than steel balls. 
The centrifugal forces and friction are significantly lower.
Hybrid bearings allow very high speeds – even with grease 
lubrication – as well as long operating life and low operating 
temperatures.

The most important functions of the cage are:
■to separate the rolling elements from each other in order to 
minimise friction and heat generation
■to maintain the rolling elements at the same distance from 
each other in order to ensure uniform load distribution
■to prevent the rolling elements from falling out in bearings that 
can be dismantled or swivelled out
■to guide the rolling elements in the load zone of the bearing.
Rolling bearing cages are subdivided into sheet metal and solid 
section cages.
Sheet metal cages
These cages are predominantly made from steel and for some 
bearings from brass, Figure 4. In comparison with solid section 
cages made from metal, they are of lower mass. 
Since a sheet metal cage only fills a small proportion of the gap 
between the inner and outer ring, lubricant can easily reach 
the interior of the bearing and is held on the cage.
In general, a sheet steel cage is only included in the bearing 
designation if it is not defined as a standard version of the bearing.
Solid section cages
These cages are made from metal, laminated fabric or plastic, 
Figure 5. They can be identified from the bearing designation.
Solid section cages made from
metal or laminated fabric
Solid section cages made from metal are used where there are 
requirements for high cage strength and at high temperatures. 
Solid section cages are also used if the cage must be guided on ribs. 
Rib-guided cages for bearings running at high speeds are made in 
many cases from light materials such as light metal or laminated 
fabric in order to achieve low inertia forces.
Solid section cages made from
polyamide PA66
Solid section cages made from polyamide 66 are produced using 
injection moulding, Figure 6. Cage types can thus generally be 
realised that allow designs with particularly high load carrying 
capacity. The elasticity and low mass of polyamide are favourable 
under shock type bearing loads, high accelerations and 
decelerations und tilting of the bearing rings in relation to each 
other. Polyamide cages have very good sliding and emergency 
running characteristics.
Cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide 66 are suitable 
for long term temperatures up to +120 °C.
When using oil lubrication, additives in the oil can impair the cage 
operating life. The interrelationship between the cage operating life, 
the long term temperature of the stationary bearing ring and 
the lubricant is shown in Figure 7, page 102. Aged oil can also 
impair the cage operating life at high temperatures, so attention 
must be paid to compliance with the oil change intervals.

Guidance method
A further means of distinguishing between cages is their guidance 
method, Figure 8. Most cages are guided by the rolling elements and 
do not have a suffix for the guidance method.
If guidance is by the bearing outer ring, the suffix A is used. 
Cages that are guided on the inner ring have the suffix B.
Under normal operating conditions, the cage design defined as 
the standard cage is generally suitable. Standard cages that may 
differ within a bearing series according to the bearing size are 
described in the product sections.
Under special operating conditions, a cage that is suitable for 
the specific conditions must be selected.

Rolling bearings are thermally stabilised such that, depending 
on the bearing type, they are generally dimensionally stable up to 
+120 °C or +150 °C.
Operating temperatures above +150 °C require special heat 
treatment. Bearings treated in this way are available by agreement 
and are identified by the suffix S1 ... S4 (DIN 623-1).
Temperature range and corresponding suffixes: 
see table Bearings for high temperatures.
The temperature data in the product sections must be observed.
Bearings for high temperatures –
suffixes
Track rollers
An operating temperature of +70 °C is regarded as a normal 
operating temperature. Further temperature data in the product 
descriptions must be observed.
The permissible temperature for sealed bearings is dependent 
on the requirements for the operating life of the grease filling and 
on the action of the contact seals.
Sealed bearings are greased with specially tested, high 
performance, high quality greases. These greases can withstand 
+120 °C for short periods. At long term temperatures of +70 °C
and above, a reduction in the operating life of standard greases with 
a lithium soap base must be expected.
In many cases, adequate operating life values are only achieved at 
high temperatures through the use of special greases. In these 
cases, it must also be checked whether seals made from especially 
heat-resistant materials must be used. The operating limit of normal 
contact seals is +100 °C.
If high temperature synthetic materials are used for seals and 
greases, it must be noted that the particularly high performance 
materials containing fluoride may give off harmful gases and 
vapours when heated to approx. +300 °C and above. This may 
occur, for example, if a welding torch is used in the dismantling 
of a bearing.
High temperatures are critical especially in the case of seals made 
from fluoroelastomer (FKM, FPM, e.g. Viton) or greases containing 
fluoride such as the rolling bearing grease Arcanol TEMP200 and 
greases to GA11.
If high temperatures are unavoidable, attention must be paid to the 
valid safety data sheet for the specific fluoride-containing material, 
which can be obtained upon request.

Anti-corrosion protection
Bearings are not resistant to corrosion by water or agents containing 
alkalis or acids but are often exposed to these corrosion-inducing 
agents. In these applications, anti-corrosion protection is therefore 
a decisive factor in achieving a long operating life of the bearings.
In principle, corrosion-resistant steels to ISO 693-17 can be used for 
components at risk of corrosion. These bearings have the prefix S; 
for deep groove ball bearings with anti-corrosion protection, 
see page 186. In many applications, however, the INA special 
plating Corrotect® is more cost-effective.
Corrotect® plating
Corrotect® is an extremely thin, electroplated surface coating – 
coating thickness 0,5 m to 3 m.
The coating is effective against moisture, contaminated water, 
salt spray and weakly alkaline and weakly acidic cleaning agents.
Advantages of the plating
The advantages of the INA special plating Corrotect® are all-round 
rust protection, including the turned surfaces of chamfers and radii, 
Figure 9. It also gives long term prevention of rust penetration 
beneath seals and smaller bright spots are protected against rust 
by the cathodic protection effect. In comparison with unplated 
parts, operating life is significantly increased by the anti-corrosion 
protection. Unplated bearings can be easily replaced by plated 
bearings of the same dimensions; there is no decrease in load 
carrying capacity, in contrast to corrosion-resistant steels. During 
storage, there is no need to use organic-based preservatives.
Fitting of plated bearings
Before bearings plated with Corrotect® are fitted, compatibility with 
the media should always be checked.
In order to reduce the press-in force required, the surface of 
the parts should be lightly greased – the tolerances are increased by 
the thickness of the plating.

Dimensional and
geometrical tolerances
Unless stated otherwise, the tolerances for radial rolling bearings 
correspond to DIN 620-2 and ISO 492; the tolerances for axial rolling 
bearings correspond to DIN 620-3 and ISO 199, Figure 10.
The accuracy corresponds to tolerance class PN. For bearings with 
increased accuracy, the tolerances are restricted to values in 
the classes P6, P5, P4 and P2. Tolerance tables for the individual 
tolerance classes: see page 107 to page 120.
The standardised tolerance classes are not applied to high precision 
bearings, which are produced to the tolerance classes P4S, SP 
and UP. These tolerances are listed in the product descriptions for 
the high precision bearings.
Measurement methods according to DIN 620-1 and ISO 1132-2 are 
valid for the acceptance inspection of rolling bearings.

Selection
of bearing arrangement
The guidance and support of a rotating shaft requires at least 
two bearings arranged at a certain distance from each other. 
Depending on the application, a decision is made between 
a locating/non-locating bearing arrangement, an adjusted bearing 
arrangement and a floating bearing arrangement.
Locating/non-locating
bearing arrangement
On a shaft supported by two radial bearings, the distances between 
the bearing seats on the shaft and in the housing frequently do not 
coincide as a result of manufacturing tolerances. The distances may 
also change as a result of temperature increases during operation. 
These differences in distance are compensated in the non-locating 
bearing. Examples of locating/non-locating bearing arrangements: 
see Figure 1 to Figure 4.
Ideal non-locating bearings are cylindrical roller bearings with 
cage of series N and NU or needle roller bearings, Figure 1 , . 
In these bearings, the roller and cage assembly can be displaced on 
the raceway of the bearing ring without ribs.
All other bearing types, for example deep groove ball bearings 
and spherical roller bearings, can only act as non-locating bearings 
if one bearing ring has a fit that allows displacement, Figure 2. 
The bearing ring subjected to point load therefore has a loose fit; 
this is normally the outer ring, see Conditions of rotation, page 132.
The locating bearing guides the shaft in an axial direction and 
supports external axial forces. In order to prevent axial preload, 
shafts with more than two bearings have only one locating bearing.
The type of bearing selected as a locating bearing depends on 
the magnitude of the axial forces and the accuracy with which 
the shafts must be axially guided.
A double row angular contact ball bearing, Figure 3 , for example, 
will give closer axial guidance than a deep groove ball bearing or 
a spherical roller bearing. A pair of symmetrically arranged angular 
contact ball bearings or tapered roller bearings Figure 4, used as 
locating bearings will provide extremely close axial guidance.
Angular contact ball bearings of the universal design, Figure 5, give 
particular advantages. The bearings can be fitted in pairs in any 
O or X arrangement without shims. Angular contact ball bearings of 
the universal design are matched so that, in an X or O arrangement, 
they have a low axial internal clearance (design UA), 
zero clearance (UO) or slight preload (UL).
Spindle bearings of the universal design UL, Figure 6, have slight 
preload when fitted in an X or O arrangement (designs with higher 
preload are available by agreement).
In gearboxes, a four point contact bearing is sometimes fitted 
directly adjacent to a cylindrical roller bearing to give a locating 
bearing arrangement, Figure 3 . The four point contact bearing, 
without radial support of the outer ring, can only support axial 
forces. The radial force is supported by the cylindrical roller bearing.
If a lower axial force is present, a cylindrical roller bearing with 
cage of series NUP can also be used as a locating bearing, 
Figure 4 .
No adjustment
or setting work with matched pairs
of tapered roller bearings
Fitting is also made easier with a matched pair of tapered roller 
bearings as a locating bearing (313..-N11CA), Figure 7 . 
They are matched with appropriate axial internal clearance so that 
no adjustment or setting work is required.

Adjusted bearing arrangement
An adjusted bearing arrangement generally consists of two 
symmetrically arranged angular contact ball bearings or tapered 
roller bearings, Figure 8.
During fitting, one bearing ring is displaced on its seat until 
the bearing arrangement achieves the required clearance or 
the necessary preload.
Application
Due to this adjustment facility, the adjusted bearing arrangement is 
particularly suitable where close guidance is required, for example 
in pinion bearing arrangements with spiral toothed bevel gears and 
spindle bearing arrangements in machine tools.
X and O arrangements
A fundamental distinction is drawn between the O arrangement, 
Figure 8 , and the X arrangement, Figure 8 , of the bearings. 
In the O arrangement, the cones and their apexes S formed by 
the pressure lines point outwards; in the X arrangement, the cones 
point inwards.
The support base H, in other words the distance between the apexes 
of the pressure cones, is larger in the O arrangement than in the 
X arrangement. The O arrangement therefore gives the lower tilting 
clearance.
Influence of
thermal expansion in
X and O arrangements
When setting the axial internal clearance, thermal expansion 
must be taken into consideration. In the X arrangement, Figure 9,
a temperature differential between the shaft and housing always 
leads to a reduction in the internal clearance (assuming 
the following preconditions: shaft and housing of identical material, 
inner ring and complete shaft at identical temperature, outer ring 
and complete housing at identical temperature).

R = roller cone apexes

156 807


In the O arrangement, a distinction is drawn between three cases:
■The apexes R of the roller cones, i.e. the intersection points of 
the extended outer ring raceway with the bearing axis, coincide: 
the required internal clearance is achieved, Figure 10 . 
■The roller cones overlap if there is a short distance 
between the bearings: 
the axial internal clearance is reduced, Figure 10 .
■The roller cones do not meet if there is a large distance 
between the bearings: 
the axial internal clearance is increased, Figure 11.
Elastic adjustment
Adjusted bearing arrangements can also be achieved by preloading 
using springs, Figure 12 . The elastic adjustment method 
compensates for thermal expansion. It can also be used where 
bearing arrangements are at risk of vibration while stationary.

Floating bearing arrangement
The floating bearing arrangement is an economical solution 
where close axial guidance of the shaft is not required, Figure 13. 
The construction is similar to that of the adjusted bearing 
arrangement. 
In the floating bearing arrangement, however, the shaft can be 
displaced in relation to the housing to the extent of the axial 
clearance s. The value s is defined as a function of the required 
guidance accuracy such that the bearings are not axially preloaded 
even under unfavourable thermal conditions.
Suitable bearings
Suitable bearing types for the floating bearing arrangement include 
deep groove ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical 
roller bearings. 
In both bearings, one ring – usually an outer ring – has a fit that 
allows displacement.
In floating bearing arrangements comprising cylindrical roller 
bearings with cage of series NJ, the length compensation takes place 
within the bearings. The inner and outer rings can have tight fits, 
Figure 13 .
Tapered roller bearings and angular contact ball bearings are 
not suitable for a floating bearing arrangement, since they must be 
adjusted in order to run correctly.

Fits
Rolling bearings are located on the shaft and in the housing in 
a radial, axial and tangential direction according to their function.
Radial and tangential location is normally achieved by force locking, 
i.e. tight fits on the bearing rings. Axial location is normally achieved 
by geometrical locking, see Axial location of bearings, page 156.
Criteria for selection of fits
The following must be observed when selecting fits:
■The bearing rings must be well supported on their circumference 
in order to allow full utilisation of the load carrying capacity.
■The bearings must not creep on their mating parts, otherwise 
the seats will be damaged.
■One ring of the non-locating bearing must adapt to changes 
in shaft and housing length and must therefore be capable 
of axial displacement; it is only in cylindrical roller bearings N 
and NU that displacement occurs within the bearing.
■The bearings must be easy to fit and dismantle.
Good support of the bearing rings on their circumference requires 
rigid seating, i.e. a tight fit. The requirement that bearings must not 
creep on their mating parts also requires rigid seating.
If non-separable bearings must be fitted and dismantled, a tight fit 
cannot be achieved, at least for one ring.
In cylindrical roller bearings N and NU and needle roller bearings, 
both rings can have tight fits, since the length compensation takes 
place within the bearing and since the rings can be fitted separately.
With tight fits and a temperature differential between the inner and 
outer ring, the radial internal clearance of the bearing is reduced. 
This must be taken into consideration when selecting the internal 
clearance, Operating clearance, page 97.
If materials other than cast iron or steel are used for the adjacent 
construction, the following must also be taken into consideration to 
achieve rigid seating: the modulus of elasticity and the differing 
coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials.
For aluminium housings, thin-walled housings and hollow shafts, 
a closer fit should be selected if necessary in order to achieve 
the same force locking as with cast iron, steel or solid shafts.
Higher loads, especially shocks, require a fit with larger interference 
and adherence to narrow geometrical tolerances.
Seats for axial bearings
Axial bearings, which can support axial loads only, must not be 
guided radially (with the exception of: axial cylindrical roller 
bearings, in which the degree of freedom in the radial direction is 
present due to the flat raceways).
In axial bearings with groove-shaped raceways, such as axial deep 
groove ball bearings, this is not present and must be achieved by 
a loose seat for the stationary washer. A rigid seat is normally 
selected for the rotating washer. 
Where axial bearings support radial forces in addition to axial 
forces, such as in axial spherical roller bearings, fits should be 
selected in the same way as for radial bearings.
The contact surfaces of the mating parts must be perpendicular 
to the axis of rotation (runout tolerance to IT5 or better), in order to 
ensure uniform load distribution over all the rolling elements.


Conditions of rotation
The conditions of rotation indicate the motion of one bearing ring 
with respect to the load direction and are expressed as either 
circumferential load or point load, see table Conditions of rotation.
Point load
If the ring remains stationary relative to the load direction, 
there are no forces that displace the ring relative to its seating 
surface. This type of load is described as point load.
There is no risk that the seating surface will be damaged and a loose 
fit is possible.
Circumferential load
If forces are present that displace the ring relative to its seating surface, every point on the raceway is subjected to load over the course 
of one revolution of the bearing. A load with this characteristic 
is described as a circumferential load.
There is a risk that the seating surface will be damaged and a tight 
fit should be used.

Shaft and housing tolerances
The fit is determined by the ISO tolerances for shafts and 
housings (ISO 286), in conjunction with the tolerances 
dmp for the 
bore and 
Dmp for the outside diameter of the bearings (DIN 620). 
The ISO tolerances are defined in the form of tolerance zones. 
They are determined by their position relative to the zero 
line (= tolerance position) and their size (= tolerance grade, see 
ISO 286). The tolerance position is indicated by letters (upper case 
for housings, lower case for shafts). A schematic illustration of 
the most common rolling bearing fits is shown in Figure 14.
The tables on pages 134 to 136 contain recommendations for 
the selection of shaft and housing tolerances.

Geometrical tolerances of
bearing seating surfaces
In order to achieve the required fit, the bearing seats/fit surfaces of 
the shaft and housing must conform to certain tolerances matched 
to the bearings, Figure 15 and table Geometrical tolerances of 
bearing seating surfaces, page 153.
of bearing seating surfaces
The degree of accuracy for the bearing seat tolerances on the shaft 
and in the housing is given in the tables Geometrical tolerances of 
bearing seating surfaces, page 153, and the ISO fundamental 
tolerances (ISO 286).
Second bearing seat
The tolerances for a second bearing seat on the shaft (d2) or in the 
housing (D2) – expressed in terms of coaxiality to DIN ISO 1101 – 
must be based on the angular adjustment facility of the specific 
bearing. Misalignments due to elastic deformation of the shaft and 
housing must be taken into consideration.
Housings
In split housings, the joints must be free from burrs.
The accuracy of the bearing seats is determined as a function of 
the accuracy of the bearing selected.
t1 = roundness
t2 = parallelism
t3 = runout of abutment shoulders

Roughness of bearing seats
The roughness of the bearing seats must be matched to 
the tolerance class of the bearings. The mean roughness value Ra 
must not be too high, in order to maintain the interference loss 
within limits. Shafts should be ground and bores should be 
precision turned.
The bore and shaft tolerances and permissible roughness values 
are also given in the design and safety guidelines in the product 
sections. The guide values for roughness correspond to DIN 5 425-1.

Raceways for bearings without
inner and/or outer ring
In rolling bearings without an inner and/or outer ring as a raceway, 
the rolling elements run directly on the shaft or in the housing bore.
The shaft and housing bore must be suitable for use as rolling 
bearing raceways.
A precision ground raceway surface without undulations is 
essential. The raceways must always be precision machined 
(grinding and honing). At a mean roughness Ra  0,2 m, it is not 
possible to utilise the full load carrying capacity of the bearings.
The additional guidelines on shaft design in the product sections 
must be observed.
The diameter tolerances of the shaft and housing determine 
the internal clearance.
Materials for raceways
Through hardening steels
Through hardening steels to ISO 683-17 (e.g. 100Cr6) are suitable 
as materials for rolling bearing raceways in direct bearing arrangements. These steels can also be surface layer hardened.
Case hardening steels
Case hardening steels must conform to ISO 683-17 (e.g. 17MnCr5, 
16CrNiMo6) or EN 10 084 (e.g. 16MnCr5).
Flame or induction hardening
For flame and induction hardening, the steels used must conform to 
ISO 683-17 (e.g. Cf54, 43CrMo4) or to DIN 17 212 (e.g. Cf53).
Surface hardness and
hardening depth
Case, flame or induction hardened steels must have a surface 
hardness of 670 HV + 170 HV and an adequate hardening 
depth CHD or Rht.
The hardening depth is, according to DIN 50190, the depth of the 
hardened surface zone at which there is still a hardness of 550 HV. 
It is measured on the finish ground shaft and must correspond to 
the stated values, but must in any case be  0,3 mm.
If the raceways are softer than 650 HV (58 HRC), the bearing 
arrangement will not achieve the full load carrying capacity. 
The basic dynamic load rating Cr and the basic static load rating C0r 
must then be reduced by the factor fH, Figure 16.
fH = factor to take account of
raceway hardness

Hardness curves
The hardness curves are shown schematically, see Figure 17 and 
Figure 18. The required hardness curve is derived from the strain on

Axial location of bearings
Axial location of the bearing rings is matched to the specific bearing 
arrangement (locating bearing, non-locating bearing, adjusted and 
floating arrangements of bearings).
Examples: see Figure 19, page 157 to Figure 29, page 160.
Design guidelines
Bearing rings must be located by force or geometrical locking in 
order to prevent lateral movement.
The bearing rings must only be in contact with the shaft or housing 
shoulder, but not with the fillet.
Every radius of the mating part must be smaller than the smallest 
chamfer dimension r or r1 of the bearing.
The radius should have rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509.
The shoulders on the mating parts must be large enough to provide 
a sufficiently wide contact surface even with the largest chamfer 
dimension of the bearing (DIN 5 418).
The bearing tables give the maximum values for the radius ra and ra1 
and the diameter of the abutment shoulders (Da and da).
Any special characteristics of the individual bearing types, 
e.g. for needle roller bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, tapered 
roller bearings and axial bearings are indicated in the product 
sections.
Locating bearings can support axial forces. The retaining element 
must be matched to these axial forces. The following are suitable: 
shoulders on shaft and housing, snap rings, housing cover, 
shaft covers, nuts, spacer rings etc.
Non-locating bearings only need to support slight axial forces 
occurring in thermal expansion. The means of axial location only 
needs to prevent creep of the rings. A tight fit is often sufficient.
Self-retaining bearings
In non-separable bearings, only one bearing ring requires a tight fit; 
the other ring is retained by the rolling elements.


Deep groove ball bearings,
double row angular contact
The bearings must be supported on both sides on the inner and 
outer rings, Figure 21 to Figure 23.
The ribs of axially loaded cylindrical roller bearings must be 
supported up to dimension d1 and D1. 
Dimensions d1, D1: see dimension tables.
For semi-locating bearings, support of the bearing rings is required 
on only one side, i.e. the side with the rib supporting the axial load.

Needle roller and cage assemblies
Axial running surfaces should be precision machined (Ra2) and 
wear resistant.
A washer should be fitted against retaining and snap rings.
Sufficient interference must be ensured between the snap ring and 
washer.

for locating bearings and bearings with a split inner ring or split 
outer ring.

Adjusted and
floating bearing arrangements
Since bearings in adjusted and floating arrangements support 
axial forces in one direction only, the bearing rings only need to be 
supported on one side. Counterguidance is performed by a second, 
symmetrically arranged bearing, Figure 28 and Figure 29. 
Shaft nuts, ring nuts, covers or spacer washers can be used as 
adjustment elements.
In floating bearing arrangements, lateral movement of the rings 
is prevented by shaft or housing shoulders, covers, snap rings etc., 
Figure 29.

Sealing has a considerable influence on the operating life of 
a bearing arrangement. It is intended to retain the lubricant in the 
bearing and prevent the ingress of contaminants into the bearing.
Contaminants may have various effects:
■A large quantity of very small, abrasive particles causes wear in 
the bearing. The increase in the operating clearance and noise 
level then bring the operating life of the bearing to an end.
■Large, overrolled hard particles reduce the fatigue life since 
pittings occur at the indentation points under high bearing loads.
A basic distinction is made between contact and non-contact seals 
in the adjacent construction and the bearing.
Non-contact seals in
the adjacent construction
With non-contact seals, there is no friction in the lubricant gap other 
than that due to lubricant friction itself. 
The seals do not undergo wear and remain capable of operation for 
a long period. Since they generate no heat, non-contact seals are 
also suitable for very high speeds.
Gap seals
A simple design, although adequate in many cases, is a narrow seal 
gap between the shaft and housing, Figure 30.
Labyrinth seals
A considerably greater sealing effect than with gap seals is achieved 
by labyrinths incorporating gaps filled with grease, Figure 31.
In contaminated environments, grease should be pressed from 
the interior into the seal gap at short intervals.
Figure 30
Simple gap seal
156 819
Figure 31
Labyrinth seals
156 820


Splash ring
Where oil lubrication is used with a horizontal shaft, splash rings are 
suitable for preventing the escape of oil, Figure 32. 
The oil outlet hole on the underside of the seal location must be 
sufficiently large that it cannot be clogged by contamination.
Flinger shields
Co-rotating flinger shields have the effect of shielding the seal gap 
from heavy contamination, Figure 33.
Baffle plates
Stationary baffle plates ensure that grease remains in the area 
around the bearing, Figure 34.
The grease collar that forms at the seal gap protects the bearing 
against contamination.
Figure 32
Splash ring
156 821
Figure 33
Flinger shields
156 822
Figure 34
Rigid baffle plates
156 823


Lamellar rings
Lamellar rings made from steel and radially sprung either outwards 
or inwards require little mounting space, Figure 35. They give 
protection against loss of grease and ingress of contamination and 
are also used as an outer seal against spray water.
Non-contact seals in
the bearing
Sealing shields in the bearing
Sealing shields, Figure 36, are compact sealing elements fitted on 
one or both sides of the bearing.
Bearings with sealing shields on both sides (suffix 2Z) are supplied 
with a grease filling.
BRS seals
Bearings with BRS seals are supplied by agreement only, Figure 37.

156 826


The friction in this case is as low as that in bearings with sealing 
shields. They have the advantage over these, however, that the 
outer elastic rim gives good sealing when fitted in the slot in the 
outer ring. This is important with a rotating outer ring since the base 
oil is separated from the soap suspension by centrifugal force and 
would escape through the unsealed metallic seat in the outer ring 
if sealing shields were fitted.
Contact seals in
the adjacent construction
Contact seals are in contact with the running surface under contact 
force (normally radial). The contact force should be kept small to 
avoid an excessive increase in frictional torque and temperature. 
The frictional torque and temperature as well as the wear of the seal 
are also affected by the lubrication condition at the running surface, 
its roughness and the sliding speed.
With grease lubrication
Felt rings are simple sealing elements that have proved effective 
primarily with grease lubrication, Figure 38. They are impregnated 
with oil before fitting and give particularly good sealing against dust. 
In unfavourable environmental conditions, two felt rings are 
arranged adjacent to each other. Felt rings and annular slots are 
standardised according to DIN 5 419.
With oil lubrication
If oil lubrication is used, sealing is primarily carried out with rotary 
shaft seals to DIN 3 760 and DIN 3 761, Figure 39. The seal collar 
with one lip is pressed against the shaft running surface by a spring.
Figure 38
Felt rings or felt strips
156 827
Figure 39
Rotary shaft seals
156 828


If the principal objective is to prevent escape of lubricant, the lip 
is arranged on the inner side of the bearing arrangement. 
A sealing ring with an additional protective lip also prevents the 
ingress of contamination. Seal lips made from the conventional 
material nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) are suitable with 
oil lubrication for circumferential speeds up to 12 m/s.
INA sealing rings for
needle roller bearings
These compact sealing rings are matched to INA needle roller 
bearings and are suitable for circumferential speeds at the running 
surface of up to 10 m/s, Figure 40. INA inner rings are recommended 
as sealing ring raceways.
Lip seal with axial sealing action
The V ring is a lip seal with axial sealing action, Figure 41. 
During fitting, this single piece rubber ring is pushed under tension 
along the shaft until its lip is in axial contact with the housing wall. 
The seal lip acts simultaneously as a flinger shield.
Axial lip seals are unaffected by radial misalignment and slight 
skewing of the shaft.
Rotating V rings are suitable with grease lubrication for circumferential speeds up to 12 m/s, stationary V rings up to 20 m/s. 
For circumferential speeds over 8 m/s, the V ring must be axially 
abutted and, from 12 m/s, it must be radially clamped in addition.
V rings are frequently used as outer seals in order to keep 
contamination away from a rotary shaft seal.

Axial spring seals
When using grease lubrication, effective sealing can also be 
achieved by means of axial spring seals, Figure 42. The thin sheet 
metal washers are clamped to the end face of the inner ring or outer 
ring and are axially sprung against the other bearing ring.
Contact seals in the bearing
Sealing washers
Bearings fitted with one or two sealing washers allow simple 
designs, Figure 43. The washers are suitable for giving protection 
against dust, contamination, damp atmospheres and slight 
pressure differentials.
Sealing washers are used, for example, in maintenance-free 
bearings with grease filling.
The sealing washer design RSR made from acrylonitrile butadiene 
rubber (NBR), normally used in deep groove ball bearings, is located 
under slight contact pressure against a cylindrically ground inner 
ring bore.

Fitting and dismantling
Handling
Rolling bearings are precision products. These products must be 
handled with care before and during fitting in order to maintain their 
full performance capacity.
Rolling bearings are preserved using an anti-corrosion agent with 
a mineral oil base, dry preserved using VCI paper or provided with 
a long term preservative for overseas transport.
The preservative and packaging used with rolling bearings must 
be matched to each other to maintain the characteristics of 
the bearings for as long as possible. 
Storage of rolling bearings
During storage, measures must be taken to prevent action by 
aggressive media such as gases, mist or aerosols of acids, alkalis or 
salts. Direct sunlight should also be avoided since, apart from 
the harmful effects of UV radiation, it can lead to wide temperature 
fluctuations in the packaging. 
Parts must be stored in dry, clean rooms with the temperature as 
constant as possible.
In order to prevent condensation, the following permissible 
conditions should be adhered to:
■temperature between +6 °C and +25 °C, for short periods +30 °C
■temperature differences between day and night 	 8 K
■relative humidity of max. 65%.
The storage period for greased and sealed bearings is limited by 
the shelf life of the grease and the sealing ring material.
Permissible storage periods
for rolling bearings
With normal preservation, bearings can be stored for up to 5 years 
if the above conditions are fulfilled. If the permissible storage period 
is exceeded, it is recommended that the bearing should be checked 
for preservative condition and for corrosion. By agreement, we will 
give information on the risk assessment relating to the continued 
storage or use of older bearings.
In special cases, special preservatives are used that permit shorter 
or longer storage periods than the normal preservation.
Bearings sealed on both sides with sealing shields (suffix 2Z) or 
sealing washers (suffix 2RSR) should not, where possible, be stored 
up to the limit of their normal storage capability. The greases used 
for filling may undergo changes in their chemical-physical behaviour 
during storage as a result of ageing. Even if the minimum 
performance capacity remains, the safety reserves of the grease 
may have diminished. Further relevant information is given in the 
section Lubrication.


Fitting and dismantling
Unpacking of rolling bearings
Perspiration from handling leads to corrosion. Hands should be kept 
clean and dry and gloves worn if necessary.
Bearings should only be removed from their original packaging 
immediately before assembly. If bearings are removed from 
multi-item packaging with dry preservation, the package must be 
closed again immediately afterwards, since the protective vapour 
phase is only effective in closed packaging.
Bearings should be oiled or greased immediately after unpacking.
Compatibility, miscibility
The anti-corrosion agent in rolling bearings with an oil-based 
preservative is compatible and miscible with oils and greases with 
a mineral oil base. Compatibility should be checked if synthetic 
lubricants or thickeners other than lithium or lithium complex soaps 
are used.
If there is an incompatibility, the anti-corrosion oil should be 
washed out before greasing, especially in the case of lubricants 
with a PTFE/alkoxyfluoroether base and thickeners based on 
polycarbamide. Bearings should be washed out if the lubricant 
is changed or the rolling bearings are contaminated.
If in doubt, please consult the relevant lubricant manufacturer.
Cleaning of rolling bearings
If cleaning is to be carried out, the legal regulations relating to 
environmental protection, health and safety at work etc. must be 
observed. The specifications of the cleaning agent manufacturer, 
for example on handling, must be observed. The design and safety 
guidelines in the product sections must be observed.
Cleaning should be carried out using brushes, paint brushes or lintfree cloths. If the bearings contain resinous oil or grease residues, 
precleaning by mechanical means followed by treatment with 
an aqueous, strongly alkaline cleaning agent is recommended.
The following are suitable for degreasing and washing of rolling 
bearings:
■aqueous neutral, acidic or alkaline cleaning agents. 
Check the compatibility of alkaline agents with aluminium 
components before cleaning
■organic cleaning agents such as paraffin oil free from water and 
acid, petroleum ether (not petrol), spirit, dewatering fluids, 
freon 12 substitutes, cleaning agents containing chlorinated 
hydrocarbons.
Paraffin oil, petroleum ether, spirit and dewatering fluids are 
flammable and alkaline agents are corrosive. The use of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons is associated with the risk of fire, explosion and 
decomposition as well as with health hazards.
These hazards and appropriate protective measures are described 
comprehensively in datasheet ZH1/425 of the Hauptverband 
der gewerblichen Berufsgenossenschaften (German Federation of 
Institutions for Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention).
Rolling bearings must be dried and preservative applied 
immediately after cleaning – risk of corrosion.


Fitting
Comprehensive information on fitting and dismantling is given 
in the publications WL 80 100, Mounting of Rolling Bearings and 
WL 80 250, Equipment and Services for the Mounting and 
Maintenance of Rolling Bearings.
For more extensive work, a fitting manual should be available 
that precisely describes all relevant work. The manual should 
also contain details on means of transport, fitting equipment, 
measurement tools, type and quantity of lubricant and a precise 
description of the fitting procedure.
Guidelines for fitting
■Before fitting, familiarise yourself with the design by means of 
the final assembly drawing.
■Before fitting, check whether the bearing presented for fitting 
corresponds to the data in the drawing.
■The assembly area must be kept clean and free from dust.
■Protect bearings from dust, contaminants and moisture. 
Contaminants have a detrimental influence on the running and 
operating life of rolling bearings.
■Check the housing bore and shaft seat of the axis for 
dimensional and geometrical accuracy and cleanliness.
■Wipe away any anti-corrosion agent from the seating and contact 
surfaces, wash anti-corrosion agent out of tapered bores.
■Lightly oil the bearing ring seating surfaces.
■Check that the shaft and housing bore have a lead chamfer of 
10° to 15°.
■Do not cool the bearings excessively, since moisture due to 
condensation can lead to corrosion in the bearings and bearing 
seats.
■After fitting, provide the rolling bearings with lubricant.
■Check the correct functioning of the bearing arrangement.


Fitting and dismantling
Fitting of rolling bearings
with cylindrical seats
Avoid applying direct blows to the bearing rings with a hammer.
In non-separable bearings, apply the fitting forces to the ring with 
a tight fit, which should also be fitted first, Figure 1.
If the inner ring of a non-separable bearing will have a tight fit, 
press the bearing onto the shaft first. Then push the bearing 
together with the shaft into the housing (fit clearance).
In separable bearings, Figure 2, fitting is easier; both rings can be 
fitted individually. Rotating the ring while fitting to give a screwdriver 
effect will help to avoid scraping marks.
In non-separable bearings,
fit the ring with the tight fit first
(tight fit for the inner ring
in this case)
156 832
In cylindrical roller bearings,
the rings are fitted individually
(tight fit)
156 833


Cold fitting of
bearings by pressing
Bearings up to a bore diameter of approx. 80 mm can be 
pressed onto the shaft while cold for normal tight fits (mechanical or 
hydraulic presses), Figure 3.
If a press is not available, the bearings can be fitted by means of 
a hammer and mounting sleeve. 
In bearings with an angular adjustment facility, tilting of the outer 
ring is prevented by a mounting disc that is in contact with both 
bearing rings, Figure 4. In bearings with axially protruding cages 
or balls (e.g. some self-aligning ball bearings), the disc must have 
a turned recess, Figure 4 .

Fitting and dismantling
Heating of bearings
Bearings with a cylindrical bore should be heated before fitting if 
a tight fit on the shaft is intended and excessive effort is required for 
pressing by mechanical means. The heating temperature required 
for problem-free fitting is shown as a function of bearing bore 
diameter in Figure 5.
The data are valid for maximum fit interference, a room temperature 
of +20 °C and an excess temperature safety margin of 30 K.
Induction heating devices
Induction heating devices are particularly suitable for achieving 
rapid, safe and clean heating. These devices are used mainly in 
volume fitting work.
Heating plate
As an interim measure, individual bearings can be heated on an 
electric heating plate. The bearing is covered with a metal sheet 
and turned several times. A thermostatic controller is absolutely 
necessary.
Heating cabinet
Safe, clean heating of bearings can be carried out in a thermostatically controlled hot air or heating cabinet. 
This method is mainly used for small and medium sized bearings. 
The heating times are relatively long.
Oil bath
With the exception of sealed, greased bearings and high precision 
bearings, rolling bearings of all sizes and type can be heated in an 
oil bath. A thermostatic controller is advisable (temperature +80 °C 
to +100 °C). In order to achieve uniform heating, the bearings 
should be laid on a grid or suspended in the oil bath.
Risk of accidents, environmental pollution by oil vapour, 
flammability of hot oil, risk of bearing contamination.

Fitting of rolling bearings
with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered bore are mounted either directly on 
the tapered shaft seat or by means of an adapter sleeve or extraction 
sleeve on a cylindrical shaft, Figure 6 , , .
Small bearings (with a bore of up to approx. 80 mm) are driven up 
the tapered shaft seat or adapter sleeve using a locknut. 
The tight fit is achieved by the axial pressing of the inner ring. 
The nut is tightened using, for example, a hook wrench. 
Small extraction sleeves can also be pressed into the gap between 
the shaft and inner ring bore using a locknut.
Reduction
in radial internal clearance
The reduction in radial internal clearance as a result of inner ring 
expansion is used as a means of checking the tight fit. 
In spherical roller bearings, the radial internal clearance (sr) must 
be measured simultaneously over both rows of rollers, Figure 7. 
Alternatively, the axial displacement is measured.
Values for reduction in radial internal clearance and displacement in 
spherical roller bearings: see section Spherical roller bearings.
For the measurement of radial internal clearance, aids such as feeler 
gauges FEELER.GAUGE100 and FEELER.GAUGE300 are suitable.

Fitting and dismantling
Fitting using pressure screws
or hydraulic tool
Even in the case of medium sized bearings, the forces required to 
tighten nuts are considerable. In such cases, fitting can be made 
easier by using locknuts with pressure screws 
(not suitable for spherical roller bearings of E1 design, Figure 8 ). 
For the fitting of large bearings, a hydraulic device should be used to 
drive up the bearing or press in the sleeve, Figure 8 . 
Hydraulic nuts are available for all common threaded sleeves and 
shafts.
Hydraulic method
The hydraulic method gives considerable assistance in the fitting 
and particularly in the dismantling of bearings with a bore of 
approx. 160 mm and above.
For fitting, an oil with a viscosity of 75 mm2/s at +20 °C
(nominal viscosity 32 mm2/s at +40 °C) is recommended.
Guidelines for dismantling
Comprehensive information on fitting and dismantling is given 
in the publications WL 80 100, Mounting of Rolling Bearings and 
WL 80 250, Equipment and Services for the Mounting and 
Maintenance of Rolling Bearings.
Dismantling should be taken into consideration in the original 
design of the bearing location. If bearing rings are to be mounted 
with a tight fit, slots should be provided in the shaft or housing bore 
to facilitate removal of the bearing rings.
If the bearing is to be reused, the following guidelines should be 
taken into consideration:
■do not use a concentrated or “hard” flame
■do not apply direct blows to the bearing rings
■do not apply fitting forces through the rolling elements
■carefully clean the bearings after dismantling.

Dismantling
of rolling bearings
on cylindrical seats
If the bearings and adjacent parts are to be reused, the extraction 
tool should be applied to the ring fitted with a tight fit.
In non-separable bearings, the ring fitted with a drive fit is 
dismantled and the ring with a tight fit is then removed.
Extraction of small bearings
For the extraction of small bearings, mechanical extraction devices, 
Figure 9 or hydraulic presses are suitable. Dismantling is made 
easier if there are extraction slots on the shaft or housing so that 
the extraction tool can be applied to the bearing ring fitted with 
a tight fit. 
Special devices are available for those cases where extraction slots 
are not present.
Extraction of inner rings using an
induction device
Induction heating devices are used mainly to extract the shrinkfitted inner rings of cylindrical roller bearings, Figure 10.
Heating is achieved quickly and the rings are loosened easily 
without the transfer of substantial heat to the shaft.

three adjustable arms for

Fitting and dismantling
Heating rings
Heating rings made from light metal with radial slots can be used 
to dismantle the inner rings of cylindrical roller bearings that have 
no ribs or only one rigid rib, Figure 11.
Heating rings are heated on an electric heating plate to between 
+200 °C and +300 °C, pushed over the bearing ring to be extracted 
and clamped in place using the grips. Once the press fit on the shaft 
has been eliminated, both rings are removed together. 
The bearing ring must be removed from the heating ring immediately 
after extraction in order to prevent overheating.
Flames
If an induction device is not available and there are no oil ducts for 
the hydraulic method, the inner rings of separable bearings can if 
necessary be heated for extraction by means of a flame, preferably 
using a ring burner. 
This should be done with extreme care since the rings are sensitive 
to uneven heating and localised overheating.

the extraction of cylindrical roller

Dismantling of rolling
bearings with tapered bore
Mechanical dismantling
Where bearings are mounted directly on a tapered shaft seat or on 
an adapter sleeve, the locking effect of the shaft or adapter sleeve 
nut must be loosened first. The nut is then unscrewed by the amount 
of the drive-up distance. The inner ring is then driven off the sleeve 
or shaft, for example using a hammer and metal drift or impact 
block, Figure 12 , .
If an impact block is used, this avoids the risk of slipping.
Bearings located using extraction sleeves are dismantled with 
the aid of the extraction nut, Figure 12 .
 Metal drift
 Impact block
 Extraction nut
Figure 12
Dismantling of bearings

Fitting and dismantling
Large bearings located using an extraction sleeve require 
considerable force. In this case, locknuts with additional pressure 
screws can be used, Figure 13 . A disc is inserted between 
the inner ring and pressure screws. 
Hydraulic dismantling
An easier and more economical method is the dismantling of 
extraction sleeves using hydraulic nuts, Figure 13 . 
The protruding extraction sleeve is supported by a heavy-section 
ring.
The dismantling of large bearings can be made easier by using 
the hydraulic method, Figure 13 , and Figure 14. Oil is pressed 
between the fit surfaces. The adjacent parts can then moved in 
relation to each other by applying only slight force and without 
the risk of surface damage. 
Tapered shafts must be provided with appropriate oil slots and feed 
holes. Oil injectors are sufficient to generate the pressure required.
The extraction sleeve becomes loose abruptly. Leave the nut on 
the shaft.
Large adapter and extraction sleeves already have the appropriate 
slots and holes. In this case, a pump must be used to generate 
the oil pressure required.
Suitable oils
For dismantling, the oil used should have a viscosity of 
approx. 150 mm2/s at +20 °C (nominal viscosity 46 mm2/s at 
+40 °C).
Fretting corrosion can be dissolved by rust-dissolving additives in 
the oil.

Disposal of
bearings after dismantling
If the bearings are not to be reused after dismantling, they should be 
separated into their constituent parts. Grease, seals and plastic 
parts should be disposed of in accordance with the relevant waste 
product guidelines.
Bearing rings and rolling elements can be sent for recycling.

Deep groove ball bearings are versatile, self-retaining bearings 
with solid outer rings, inner rings and ball and cage assemblies. 
These products, which are of simple design, robust in operation and 
easy to maintain, are available in single and double row designs and 
in open and sealed variants. Due to the manufacturing processes 
used, open bearings can have turned recesses in the outer ring for 
seals or shields.
Due to their low frictional torque, deep groove ball bearings are 
suitable for high speeds.
Radial and axial load capacity
Due to the raceway geometry and the balls used as rolling elements, 
deep groove ball bearings can support axial loads in both directions 
as well as radial loads. Axial load carrying capacity, page 192.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The angular adjustment facility of single row deep groove ball 
bearings is limited, so the bearing positions must be well aligned.
Misalignments can lead to unfavourable ball running and induce 
additional loads in the bearing that shorten the operating life.
In order to keep these loads at a low level, only small adjustment 
angles are permissible – dependent on the load – for single row 
deep groove ball bearings, see table Load and adjustment angle.
Due to their internal construction, double row deep groove ball 
bearings do not have an angular adjustment facility. When using 
these bearings, therefore, misalignments are not permissible.

Single row deep groove
Single row deep groove ball bearings are the most frequently used 
type of rolling bearing. They are produced in numerous sizes and 
designs and are particularly economical.
Sealing/lubrication
Bearings without seals are suitable for high to very high speeds.
Deep groove ball bearings with the suffix 2Z have gap seals on 
both sides. These bearings are greased using a high quality grease, 
lubricated for life and suitable for high speeds.
Bearings with the suffix 2RSR have lip seals on both sides made 
from nitrile butadiene rubber NBR. 
These designs are greased using a high quality grease, 
lubricated for life and suitable for moderate speeds.
By agreement, we can supply bearings with non-contact BRS seals 
on both sides (suffix 2BRS). The frictional behaviour of these 
bearings is just as favourable as that of bearings with Z seals. 
If the inner ring is stationary and the outer ring rotates, the lubricant 
loss is smaller than that in bearings with Z seals.
Corrosion-resistant deep groove
In deep groove ball bearings of series S60, S62 and S63, 
the cages and the inner and outer rings are made from corrosionresistant steel X70Cr13, while the balls are made from high alloy 
chromium steel X102CrMo17.
These bearings are resistant to water, water vapour, alkalis, 
photographic developers and in certain cases to acids.
Corrosion-resistant deep groove ball bearings are available in open 
and sealed designs.
In the case of bearings sealed on both sides (suffix 2RSR) in 
particular, the resistance to acids is limited by the sealing ring 
material nitrile butadiene rubber NBR.


Matched single row deep groove
By agreement, deep groove ball bearings of series 160, 60, 62, 63, 
64 and 618 are available in various arrangements as matched pairs 
of bearings, Figure 1.
Sets in an O arrangement (suffix DB) can support axial loads in both 
directions as well as tilting moments.
Sets in an X arrangement (suffix DF) can support axial loads in both 
directions but are not suitable for tilting moments.
For high axial loads from one direction, pairs of bearings in a tandem 
arrangement are suitable (suffix DT).
Double row deep groove
Double row deep groove ball bearings correspond in their structure 
and function to a pair of single row deep groove ball bearings. 
They are designed for high to very high speeds and are used where 
the load carrying capacity of single row deep groove ball bearings is 
not sufficient.
Double row deep groove ball bearings are wider than single row 
deep groove ball bearings of the same bore and outside diameter 
but have a significantly higher load carrying capacity.
Sealing/lubrication
The bearings are not sealed and are greased using a high quality 
grease.
Deep groove ball bearings without seals can be used up to an 
operating temperature of +120 °C. For applications at temperatures 
above +120 °C, please contact us. Bearings with a diameter D of 
more than 240 mm are dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Deep groove ball bearings with lip seals can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +110 °C, limited by the grease and 
sealing ring material.
Bearings with gap seals can be used from –30 °C to +120 °C.
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.

Axial load carrying capacity
Deep groove ball bearings are also suitable for axial loads.
If the bearing is subjected to high loads and high speeds, 
a reduced life as well as increased friction and bearing temperature 
must be taken into consideration.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.

angular contact ball bearings
.................................................................................................................. 230
In single row angular contact ball bearings, the raceways are 
arranged such that the forces are transmitted at a particular contact 
angle – oblique to the radial plane – from one raceway to the other.
The axial load carrying capacity increases with the contact angle. 
Due to the large contact angle, single row angular contact 
ball bearings are more suitable than deep groove ball bearings for 
supporting large axial forces acting in one direction.
Single row angular contact ball bearings can support radial 
loads and unilateral axial loads. They are adjusted against a second 
bearing that provides counterguidance.
angular contact ball bearings
.................................................................................................................. 248
Double row angular contact ball bearings are similar in design to a 
pair of single row angular contact ball bearings in an O arrangement. 
In this case, the apexes of the cones formed by the ball pressure 
lines point outwards.
Double row bearings can support high radial forces as well as axial 
forces in both directions and are particularly suitable for rigid axial 
guidance arrangements.
Depending on the series, the bearings are designed with or without 
filling slots.

Single row angular contact ball bearings are self-retaining units 
with solid inner and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies with 
polyamide, sheet metal or brass cages. The raceways of the inner 
and outer rings are offset from each other along the bearing axis. 
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs. Their angular 
adjustment facility is very limited.
Many sizes of angular contact ball bearings are classified as X-life 
products. These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have an improved raceway geometry and 
optimised surfaces. This gives a significant increase in the fatigue 
limit load of the bearings. When calculating the expanded adjusted 
rating life, values up to 50% higher can thus be achieved. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be 
designed.
Radial and axial load capacity
Single row angular contact ball bearings can support axial forces in 
one direction and high radial forces. They must be axially adjusted 
against a second bearing fitted in a mirror image arrangement.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle, the higher the load to which the bearing can 
be subjected. Due to the contact angle of 40°, these bearings can 
support high axial loads.
Universal design
Single row angular contact ball bearings of universal design have 
the suffix UA, UL or UO and are intended for fitting in pairs in an X, 
O or tandem arrangement or fitting in groups. These bearings can be 
fitted in any arrangement required.
The suffix UA indicates small axial internal clearance, suffix UL 
indicates slight preload and suffix UO indicates freedom from 
clearance in an X or O arrangement.
When ordering bearings, the total quantity of bearings must be 
stated, not the number of bearing pairs or bearing groups.
Sets without an intermediate ring are available in 
an O arrangement (DB), X arrangement (DF) or 
tandem arrangement (DT).
When ordering bearings, the number of sets must be stated, 
not the number of single bearings.
Sealing/lubrication
Bearings with the suffix 2RS have lip seals on both sides. RS contact 
seals are suitable for giving protection against dust, contamination 
and damp atmospheres. The bearings are greased with a high 
quality grease and are lubricated for life.
Bearings without seals or with seals on one side are not greased. 
They can be lubricated with grease or oil.
Open angular contact ball bearings can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.  Bearings with a diameter 
D  240 mm are dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Angular contact ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide are suitable for operating temperatures up to 
+120 °C, restricted by the cage material.
Sealed bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from 
–30 °C to +110 °C, restricted by the lubricant and the seal material.


Angular contact ball bearings with solid cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide have the suffix TVP or TVH.
Solid brass cages have the suffix MP.
The bearings are also available with universally applicable sheet 
steel window cages (suffix JP).
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.

Calculation of axial force
Under radial load, an internal axial force is induced in the bearing 
that must be supported by a second bearing and taken into 
consideration when calculating the equivalent bearing load.
Depending on the bearing arrangement (O or X arrangement), 
the axial force must first be determined for bearings adjusted 
clearance-free without preload, see table Load ratio and axial 
bearing load, page 236 and Figure 1, Figure 2.
The following preconditions apply:
■The radial forces act at the central pressure points and are 
positive
■Bearing A is subjected to a radial load FrA, bearing B to FrB
■F is an external axial force acting on bearing A.

2) If no formula is given, the axial force is not taken into consideration.
3) For bearings of series 718..-B, 70..-B, 72..-B and 73..-B,

Basic dynamic
and static load ratings for
bearing pairs
If two bearings of the same size and design are fitted immediately 
adjacent to each other in an O or X arrangement, the basic dynamic 
load rating Cr and basic static load rating C0r of the bearing pair are 
as follows:
■Cr = 1,625 · Cr single bearing
■C0r = 2 · C0r single bearing
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.
For greased and sealed bearings, the speeds are lower than in 
the case of unsealed bearings.
The limiting speeds nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.
Bearings in universal design
Bearings with the suffix UA, UL and UO can be used in an X, 
O or tandem arrangement. The operating speed of the bearing pair 
is then approximately 20% below the calculated permissible 
operating speed of the single bearing.
The limiting speed nG is possible if the less favourable thermal 
balance of the bearing pair is taken into consideration.

The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-1.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Tolerances for
universal designs and for
matched bearings
In addition to the normal tolerance (no tolerance suffix), angular 
contact ball bearings of universal designs UO, UL or UA are also 
available by agreement in tolerance class P5 (suffix P5-UL or P5-UA).
The following exceptions apply: bore tolerances for bearings of 
all tolerance classes uniformly to P5 (no special suffix), width 
tolerances for universal bearings and matched bearings according to 
the following table:
Ring width tolerance
Axial internal clearance or
preload of universal design
The axial internal clearance and preload of series 70..-B, 72..-B
and 73..-B of universal design, in pairs in an X or O arrangement, 
are shown in the table Axial internal clearance/preload, page 239.
The axial internal clearance or freedom from clearance do not apply 
to fitted bearing pairs. If rigid fits are used, this leads to reduced 
axial internal clearance or increased preload of the bearing pair.

Double row angular contact ball bearings are units with solid inner 
and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies with polyamide, sheet 
steel or brass cages. Their construction is similar to a pair of single 
row angular contact ball bearings in an O arrangement but they are 
narrower to a certain extent.  They differ in the size of the contact 
angle and the design of the bearing rings.
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs. Due to 
the manufacturing processes used, open bearings can have turned 
recesses in the outer ring for seals or shields. Sealed bearings are 
maintenance-free and therefore allow particularly economical 
bearing arrangements.
The angular adjustment facility of the angular contact ball bearings 
is very limited.
Radial and axial load capacity
Double row angular contact ball bearings can support axial forces in 
both directions and high radial forces. They are particularly suitable 
for bearing arrangements where rigid axial guidance is required.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle ( = 25°, 35° and 45°), the higher the axial 
load to which the bearing can be subjected.
Without filling slot
Bearings of series 38..-B, 30..-B, 32..-B and 33..-B are self-retaining 
and do not have filling slots in the end faces of the bearing rings. 
The contact angle  = 25°. Their axial load carrying capacity is 
the same in both directions. These bearings are highly versatile.
With filling slot
Angular contact ball bearings of series 32 und 33 are self-retaining 
and have filling slots on one side. The contact angle  = 35°. 
These series must be fitted such that the main load direction is 
supported by the raceways without filling slots.
With split inner ring
Bearings of series 33..-DA have a split inner ring. Due to the contact 
angle of  = 45°, they can support high axial forces in both 
directions.
The inner ring halves are matched to the particular bearing and must 
not be interchanged with those of other bearings of the same size.
Sealing/lubrication
Series 38..-B, 30..-B, 32..-B and 33..-B with suffix 2RSR are sealed 
by lip seals on both sides. Contact seals are suitable for giving 
protection against dust, contamination and damp atmospheres.
Series with the suffix 2Z have gap seals on both sides.
Sealed bearings are greased with a high quality grease and 
are lubricated for life. Bearings without seals can be lubricated with 
grease or oil.


Open bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from –30 °C 
to +150 °C.
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide
are suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C, restricted by 
the cage material.
Bearings with suffix 2RSR are suitable for operating temperatures 
up to +110 °C, restricted by the lubricant and seal material.
Bearings without a cage suffix have standard cages made from sheet 
steel.
Angular contact ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide have the suffix TVH. 
Bearings with ball-guided solid brass cages are indicated by 
the suffix M. Solid brass cages guided on the outer ring have 
the suffix MA.
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Cage/bore code
1) Other cage designs available by agreement. 
In such cages, suitability for high speeds and high temperatures as well as 
the basic load ratings may differ from the values for bearings with standard 
cages.

Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for ball bearings with cage.
The reference speed nB can be exceeded up to the limiting speed nG 
if permitted by the operating conditions. If the reference speed in 
the tables is higher than the limiting speed, the higher value cannot 
be used.
In bearings with lip seals 2RSR, the speed is limited by 
the permissible sliding speed of the sealing lips, so only the limiting 
speed is given in the dimension tables.
The limiting speed nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.

The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-3.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Axial internal clearance
Double row angular contact ball bearings of the basic design have 
the normal axial internal clearance (CN). Bearings are available by 
agreement with an axial internal clearance larger (C3) or smaller (C2) 
than normal.
Bearings with a split inner ring are intended for higher axial loads. 
In general, they have a tighter fit than unsplit bearings. Their normal 
internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance group C3 for 
unsplit bearings.

Spindle bearings are single row angular contact ball bearings, 
comprising solid inner and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies 
with solid window cages. They cannot be dismantled. The bearings 
are available in open and sealed designs.
Spindle bearings have restricted tolerances. They are particularly 
suitable for bearing arrangements with very high requirements for 
guidance accuracy and suitability for high speeds. They have proved 
extremely suitable for spindle bearing arrangements in machine 
tools.
Radial and axial load capacity
The bearings can support axial forces in one direction as well as 
radial forces. Spindle bearings used in an O or X arrangement can 
support axial forces in both directions and moments. Bearings in 
a tandem arrangement can only support axial loads in one direction.
Spindle bearings are available with a contact angle  = 15° (suffix C) 
or  = 25° (suffix E).
Standard spindle bearings
Standard spindle bearings B70, B719 and B72 have steel balls.
With ceramic balls
Spindle bearings HCB70, HCB719 and HCB72 have balls in 
standard sizes made from ceramic (hybrid bearings).
Sealing/lubrication
Spindle bearings B70..-2RSD, B719..-2RSD, B72..-2RSD, 
HCB70..-2RSD, HCB719..-2RSD and HCB72..-2RSD are sealed 
on both sides by gap seals. They are greased with a 
FAG polycarbamide grease and are maintenance-free.
High speed spindle bearings
High speed spindle bearings HSS70 and HSS719 have smaller 
steel balls.
With ceramic balls
High speed spindle bearings HCS70 and HCS719 with ceramic 
balls (hybrid bearings) are also available.
These four series thus achieve higher speeds, have lower friction 
and heat generation, place less strain on the lubricant and have 
a longer operating life.
Sealing/lubrication
The bearings are sealed on both sides by gap seals. 
They are greased with a FAG polycarbamide grease and are 
maintenance-free.
Unsealed bearings of series HS70 and HS719 as well as HC70 and 
HC719 are also available.
X-life ultra bearings
X-life ultra bearings have bearing rings made from a corrosionresistant steel that contains nitrogen and has a particularly fine 
structure (prefix X) and ceramic balls. They fulfil very high 
requirements for speed and load carrying capacity. The bearings 
have longer life compared to conventional bearings. Most series of 
spindle bearings are available as X-life ultra bearings.
For a more detailed description, see Catalogue AC 41 130 
Super Precision Bearings.


Universal designs
Spindle bearings of universal design are intended for mounting in 
pairs or groups in X, O or tandem arrangements.
Bearings with the suffix UL are designed for slight preload in an 
X or O arrangement.
The preload is altered by mounting and the operating conditions.
Ordering data
When ordering, the number of individual bearings must be stated.
The bearings are suitable for operating temperatures from –30 °C to 
+100 °C, restricted by the seal and cage material.
The operating temperature must be taken into consideration when 
selecting the lubricant.
Spindle bearings have solid window cages made from laminated 
fabric or high performance plastic (suffix T). The cage is guided on 
the outer ring.
Check the chemical resistance of the seal or cage material to 
synthetic greases and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
the cages and seals at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Suffixes for the available designs: see table.

Static load safety factor
In order to achieve sufficiently smooth running, a static load safety 
factor S0  3 is necessary.
Basic static load rating according to dimension tables.
If using several bearings, C0r = i · C0r single bearing, i = number of single bearings
Equivalent static load.
The speeds of the bearing arrangements are dependent on:
■the preload of the bearings
■the elastic or rigid arrangement of the bearings in the spindle
■mounting as single bearings or in pairs
■the lubricants
■the cooling of the bearings.
The speeds stated in the dimension tables are guide values for 
single bearings under elastic preload and low loads.
The limiting speeds nG in the dimension tables apply for lubrication 
with grease or for minimal quantity lubrication with oil and must not 
be exceeded.
For a more detailed description, see Catalogue AC 41 130, 
Super Precision Bearings.
Bearing sets
Universal bearings of the same sort (same bore and outside 
diameter) are available as sets. They can be used in any 
arrangement (O, X, tandem) as shown on page 278, Figure 1 to 
Figure 3.
Sets with slight preload have the following designations:
■duplex; suffix DUL (2 bearings)
■triplex; suffix TUL (3 bearings)
■quadruplex; suffix QUL (4 bearings).
Ordering data
When ordering bearings, the number of sets must be stated, 
not the number of single bearings.

a specifically defined arrangement.
The bearings must be fitted in the arrangement ordered.

The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-1. 
The dimensional tolerances of the bearings correspond to tolerance 
class P4, the running tolerances correspond to tolerance class P2 to 
DIN 620-2.
Deviations from the nominal dimensions for the bore, outside 
diameter and bearing width are indicated on the end faces of 
the inner and outer rings and on the packaging, where they are 
stated in the sequence “bore/outside diameter/bearing width”.

Four point contact bearings are single row angular contact ball 
bearings and therefore require significantly less space in an axial 
direction than double row designs.
The bearings comprise solid outer rings, split inner rings and ball 
and cage assemblies with brass or polyamide cages. The two-piece 
inner rings allow a large complement of balls to be accommodated. 
The inner ring halves are matched to the particular bearing and must 
not be interchanged with those of other bearings of the same size. 
The outer ring with the ball and cage assembly can be mounted 
separately from the two inner ring halves.
Axial load capacity
in both directions
Due to the design of the rolling element raceways with their high 
raceway shoulders, the contact angle of 35° and the large number 
of rolling elements, four point contact bearings have a high load 
carrying capacity. They can support high axial forces in both 
directions as well as small radial loads.
With or without retaining slots
in the outer ring
Single row four point contact bearings capable of supporting axial 
loads in both directions are often combined with a radial bearing 
and used as an axial bearing with radial clearance in a housing. 
For quick and secure location, larger four point contact bearings 
therefore have two retaining slots in the outer ring offset by 180°. 
These bearings have the suffix N2.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The possible skewing of the inner rings in relation to the outer ring 
depends on the bearing load, the operating clearance and 
the bearing size and is very small. Four point contact bearings 
are not therefore suitable for the compensation of angular 
misalignments in housing bores or due to shaft deflections.
Skewing of the bearing rings increases the running noise, 
places increased strain on the cages and has a harmful influence 
on the operating life of the bearings.
Sealing/lubrication
Four point contact bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Bearings with solid brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C. 
Bearings with an outside diameter of more than 240 mm are 
dimensionally stable up to +200 °C.
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.
The standard cages for four point contact bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code, page 318.
Four point contact bearings with brass cages have the suffix MPA. 
These window cages are guided on the outer ring.
Cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are indicated by 
the suffix TVP.
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.

Minimum axial load
In order to ensure low friction in the bearing, especially at high 
speeds, a minimum axial load is required. In order to prevent an 
excessive increase in friction, the axial force should be sufficiently 
high that the rolling bearings are in contact with the inner and outer 
ring raceway at only one point. This is ensured if Fa  1,2 · Fr.
Application as
axial bearings only
If four point contact bearings are to be used as axial bearings only, 
the outer ring must have a large radial clearance in the housing. 
As a result, the bearings are not subjected to radial load.
High speeds can be achieved if four point contact ball bearings are 
subjected to purely axial load.
ISO 15 312 does not give thermal reference speeds for these 
bearings.
The dimension tables therefore only state limiting speeds nG. 
These values are for oil lubrication and must not be exceeded. 
If higher speeds are required, please contact us.
The shoulders on the adjacent construction (shaft/housing) must be 
sufficiently high that adequate abutment surfaces are ensured even 
with very large chamfer dimensions.
The maximum values for the radii ra and the diameters of 
the abutment surfaces da, Da are indicated in the dimension tables.
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 628-4.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
Axial internal clearance
The axial internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance 
group CN.

Self-aligning ball bearings are double row, self-retaining units 
comprising outer rings with a concave raceway, inner rings with 
a cylindrical or tapered bore and ball and cage assemblies. 
The bearings are available in open and sealed designs.
Radial and axial load capacity
Self-aligning ball bearings can support axial forces in both 
directions as well as radial forces.
With cylindrical/tapered bore
Bearings of series 12, 13, 22 and 23 are available with a cylindrical 
or tapered bore.
Bearings with a tapered bore have a bore taper of 1:12 and 
the suffix K.
With adapter sleeve
Self-aligning ball bearings with a tapered bore are also available 
with an adapter sleeve, locknut and tab washer. 
Adapter sleeves must be ordered in addition to the bearing.
With extended inner ring
Bearings of series 112 have an extended inner ring, a location slot 
on one side of the inner ring and are located by means of dowel pins.
These bearings are intended for simple bearing arrangements with 
conventional shafts. Due to the bearing bore tolerance (J7), they are 
very easy to fit.
Sealing/lubrication
Self-aligning ball bearings of series 12, 13, 22 and 23 are also 
available in sealed designs. Sealed bearings have contact seals on 
both sides and the suffix 2RS.
They are greased with a high quality grease and are 
maintenance-free.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
Under normal operating conditions and with a rotating inner ring, 
self-aligning ball bearings can swivel approx. 4° about their central 
position; sealed bearings can swivel by max. 1,5°. As a result, 
they permit skewing between the inner and outer ring and can 
thus compensate misalignments, shaft deflections and housing 
deformations.
If the outer ring rotates or the inner ring undergoes tumbling 
motion, the angular adjustment facility is smaller. In this case, 
please contact us.
Open bearings with brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
suitable for operating temperatures up to +120 °C.
Sealed self-aligning ball bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +100 °C, restricted by the grease and 
seal material.


The standard cages for self-aligning ball bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code.
Self-aligning ball bearings with cages made from glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide 66 have the suffix TVH.
Ball-guided solid brass cages are indicated by the suffix M.
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and oils and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.

In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to sufficient load. If insufficient load is applied – 
for example at high speeds during a test run – slippage can occur 
that may lead under conditions of inadequate lubrication to bearing 
damage.
The minimum load should be P/Cr = 0,01.
If the reference speed nB in the dimension tables is higher than 
the limiting speed nG, the higher value cannot be used.
In bearings with contact seals (suffix 2RS), the speed is limited by 
the permissible sliding speed of the sealing lips, so only the limiting 
speed nG is given in the tables.
The dimension tables give the maximum radius dimension ra and 
the diameters of the abutment shoulders.
When fitting self-aligning ball bearings with adapter sleeves, 
attention must be paid to the dimensions of the support ring.

Projecting balls in bearings
with brass cage
In some bearings with a brass cage, the balls project to 
a certain extent at the sides. The projection C1 must be taken into 
consideration when designing the adjacent construction. 
The projection is larger in the following bearings according to 
the table, Figure 1:
Ball projection
Location
Series 112
These bearings are axially located by means of dowel pins that 
engage in the slot in the inner ring, Figure 2. These also prevent 
the inner rings creeping on the shaft.
If a shaft is to be supported by two bearings, the locating slots must 
be arranged on the sides of the bearing facing towards or away from 
each other, Figure 2.

Bearings with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered inner ring bore are:
■located either directly on tapered shaft seats or
■located on a cylindrical shaft seat using an adapter sleeve, 
locknut and tab washer.
If high axial forces are present, a support ring can be used. 
For fitting, attention must be paid to the dimensions on the support 
ring according to the dimension tables.
The main dimensions of the bearings conform to DIN 630. 
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620-2.
In series 112, the bearing bore tolerance is J7.
Radial internal clearance of
bearings with cylindrical bore
The radial internal clearance is CN.
to DIN 620-4
Radial internal clearance of
bearings with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered bore have the internal clearance group C3.
to DIN 620-4

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
High precision cylindrical roller bearings
with snap ring grooves


.................................................................................................................. 358
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage have a very high 
radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for higher speeds 
compared to full complement designs. The rollers are guided 
between rigid ribs in one of the two bearing rings and form a unit 
with this ring due to the cage. Since a bearing ring of this type can 
be removed, the rings can be mounted separately. The bearings are 
available as non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Low friction
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 402
In the low friction cylindrical roller bearings, a brass disc cage or 
plastic spacers prevent the rolling elements from coming into 
contact with each other. They combined the advantages of full 
complement cylindrical roller bearings (high load carrying capacity) 
with those of cage type bearings (high limiting speeds). 
The frictional torque is very low across the entire speed range. 
As a result, the bearings have the highest limiting speeds of any 
cylindrical roller bearings.
High precision
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 414
Cylindrical roller bearings of this design are double row precision 
bearings (non-locating bearings) for machine tools and correspond 
to tolerance class SP. They are used to give radial support for main 
spindles. The bearings are separable and are therefore easier 
to fit and dismantle. The inner ring has a tapered bore for optimum 
setting of the radial internal clearance.
Full complement
cylindrical roller bearings
.................................................................................................................. 428
These single and double row bearings have full complement rolling 
element sets. The rolling elements are guided by ribs on the bearing 
rings. Since they have the maximum possible number of rollers, 
full complement bearings have extremely high load carrying 
capacity and high rigidity. Due to the kinematic conditions, however, 
they do not achieve the high speeds that are possible when using 
cylindrical roller bearings with cage. The bearings are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Full complement
cylindrical roller bearings
with snap ring grooves
.................................................................................................................. 452
Due to the grooves in the outer rings, the bearing rings can be axially 
located using retaining rings. The bearings are therefore highly 
suitable for cable sheave bearing arrangements. Sealing rings 
on both sides of the bearings protect the running system reliably 
against contamination and moisture. Since it has the maximum 
possible number of rollers, the full complement design has 
extremely high load carrying capacity and high rigidity and is 
suitable for particularly compact designs.

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage are units comprising 
solid inner and outer rings and cylindrical roller and cage 
assemblies. The outer rings have rigid ribs on both sides or no ribs, 
the inner rings have one or two rigid ribs or are designed without 
ribs. The cage prevents the cylindrical rollers from coming into 
contact with each other during rolling.
The cylindrical roller bearings have high rigidity, high radial load 
carrying capacity and, due to the cage, are suitable for higher 
speeds compared to full complement designs. Bearings with 
the suffix E have a higher capacity roller set and are thus designed 
for very high load carrying capacity.
The bearings are separable and are therefore easier to fit and 
dismantle. Both bearing rings can be given a tight fit by this process.
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings.
Sealing/lubricant
The bearings are supplied without seals. They can be lubricated 
from the end faces.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. 
These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, these bearings have higher load carrying 
capacity and longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be 
designed.
Cylindrical roller bearings NU and N are non-locating bearings and 
can support radial forces only.
In series NU, the outer ring has two ribs, while the inner ring has no 
ribs. Bearings of series N have two ribs on the inner ring and an outer 
ring without ribs.
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other from the central position by the values “s” stated in 
the dimension tables.
Cylindrical roller bearings NJ are semi-locating bearings. 
Semi-locating bearings can support not only high radial forces but 
also axial forces in one direction and can therefore guide shafts 
axially in one direction. They act as non-locating bearings in 
the opposite direction.
The bearings have two ribs on the outer ring and one rib on 
the inner ring.
with L-section ring
Non-locating bearings NU can be combined with an L-section ring HJ 
to form a semi-locating bearing unit.
Bearings NU must not be installed with two L-section rings – 
there is a risk of jamming.
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.


Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Cylindrical roller bearings NUP and NJ with HJ are locating bearings. 
Locating bearings can support not only high radial forces but also 
axial forces in both directions and can therefore guide shafts axially 
in both directions.
Bearings with rib washer
Type NUP has two ribs on the outer ring and one rigid rib on 
the inner ring. A loose rib washer is fitted on the opposite side.
Bearings with L-section ring
Type NJ with HJ has two ribs on the outer ring, one rib on the inner 
ring and an L-section ring for the ribless side of the inner ring. 
The L-section rings suitable for the bearings are indicated in 
the dimension tables. The bearing and L-section ring must be 
ordered separately.
L-section rings
L-section rings are advantageous where, under high loads, 
the seating surface of the inner ring in NUP bearings with a loose rib 
washer is too small to provide a sufficiently high bearing seat. 
In some applications, they make it easier to fit and dismantle 
the bearings.
Single row cylindrical roller bearings with cage can be used at 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C. 
For continuous operating temperatures above +120 °C, 
please contact us.
Bearings with a plastic cage (suffix TVP2) are suitable up to +120 °C; 
the operating life is heavily dependent on the lubricant used.
Suffix M1 indicates bearings with brass cages guided by rollers.
Higher strength cylindrical roller bearings with the suffix TVP2 have 
a cage made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide PA66.
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures. 
The oil change intervals must be observed.
The cages used in the bearings are shown in the table Bearing series 
and cage material, page 363.
Other cage designs
Other cage designs available by agreement. In such cages, 
suitability for high speeds and temperatures as well as the basic 
load ratings may differ from the values for bearings with standard 
cages.


Bearing series and cage material
Suffixes for available designs: see table.
1) Available by agreement.
Permissible skewing
The permissible skewing of the inner ring relative to the outer ring 
is dependent on the load ratio Cr/P and is restricted to a few angular 
minutes.
At a ratio Cr/P  5 (P/Cr 	 0,2), the adjustment angle must be no 
than 4 angular minutes (approx. 1,2 mrad).

Cylindrical roller bearings with cage
Axial load carrying capacity
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on:
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements,
■the sliding velocity at the ribs,
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this case.
The axial limiting load Fa max must not be exceeded, in order to avoid 
impermissible pressure at the contact surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4. Continuous axial loading 
without simultaneous radial loading is not permissible.

Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
Low friction cylindrical roller bearings LSL and ZSL are of a single 
row, self-retaining design and correspond to dimension series 23. 
The bearings have solid outer rings with two ribs, the inner rings are 
designed with one rib. The inner ring is removable and thus allows 
easier mounting of the bearings. The disc cages or spacers prevent 
the cylindrical rollers from coming into contact with each other 
during rolling.
Cylindrical roller bearings NJ23..-E and spherical roller 
bearings 223..-E1 have the same design envelope as LSL1923 and 
ZSL1923.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. These bearings are 
indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, these bearings have higher load carrying 
capacity and longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain 
applications, this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can 
be designed.
Cylindrical roller bearings LSL1923 and ZSL1923 are semi-locating 
bearings and can support not only high radial forces but also large 
axial forces in one direction. They act as non-locating bearings in 
the opposite direction.
Since they have a larger number of rolling elements and larger rolling 
elements, LSL and ZSL bearings have higher radial and axial load 
carrying capacity than all comparable cylindrical roller bearing 
designs with a solid cage. They can withstand high shock loads and 
vibrations, support large centrifugal forces and allow accelerations 
up to 500 m/s2.
Due to the low frictional torque across the entire speed range and 
the low heat generation, the bearings have the highest limiting 
speeds of all cylindrical roller bearings. In addition, the optimum 
heat dissipation ensures thermally stable conditions in the bearing.
With disc cage
In cylindrical roller bearings LSL1923, an externally-guided flat 
brass disc cage prevents the cylindrical rollers from coming into 
contact with each other during rolling.
The cage has pockets to accommodate the rolling elements. 
The rolling elements are guided between the ribs on the outer ring. 
Due to its low mass, the cage is subjected to only minimal strain 
under acceleration. It therefore fulfils ideally its role as an element 
separating the rolling elements and supporting the inertia forces.
Lubricant is exchanged via axial through holes. Good oil flow 
through the axially open bearing is supported by the axial holes.
The outer ring is axially split and held together by fasteners.
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are open on both sides. 
They can be lubricated via the end faces.


Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
With spacers
In cylindrical roller bearings ZSL1923, plastic spacers prevent 
the cylindrical rollers from coming into contact with each other 
during rolling.
The spacers are designed such that the rolling element set is selfretaining, so the bearing and inner ring can be mounted separately.
The spacers are guided axially between the two outer ring ribs.
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other in one direction only by the dimension “s” stated in 
the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are open on both sides. 
They can be lubricated via the end faces.
Special design for
vibratory machinery
In addition to high basic dynamic load ratings and thus long life 
values, bearings in vibratory machinery must also be able to 
compensate or support considerable shaft tilting due to load or 
misalignment. The bearings LSL and ZSL are therefore also available 
by agreement in the BIR design. In these bearings, the inner ring 
raceway is ground slightly spherical.
Cylindrical roller bearings with disc cage or spacers are suitable for 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +120 °C.

Axial load carrying capacity
Radial cylindrical roller bearings of a semi-locating bearing design 
can support axial forces in one direction as well as radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on: 
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and 
the end faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending loads may occur 
as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this case.
The axial limiting load Fa max according to the formula must not be 
exceeded, in order to avoid impermissible pressure at the contact 
surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4.
Continuous axial loading without simultaneous radial loading is not 
permissible.

Low friction cylindrical roller bearings
If an axial force Fa is present in addition to the radial force Fr, 
the effect on the life must be calculated using our calculation 
program BEARINX®.
If an axial force F0a is present in addition to the radial force F0r, 
the effect on the static load safety factor must be calculated using 
our calculation program BEARINX®.
Minimum radial load
In continuous operation, a minimum radial load of the order of 
C0r/P  60 is necessary.
If C0r/P  60, please contact us.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must be 
located by force or physical locking means.
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulder 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509. Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in 
the dimension tables.
For semi-locating bearings, the bearings only require support on 
one side, on the rib supporting the axial load.
Full support must be provided for ribs transmitting forces in axially 
loaded bearings.

High precision cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings of this design are double row precision 
bearings for machine tools. They allow radially rigid, high precision 
bearing arrangements and are principally used to give radial support 
for main spindles.
The bearings comprise solid outer rings without ribs, solid inner 
rings with three ribs and cylindrical roller and cage assemblies 
with solid brass cages. For optimum setting of the radial internal 
clearance, the inner ring has a tapered bore with a bore taper 1:12. 
The cylindrical roller bearings are separable and are therefore easier 
to fit and dismantle. Both bearing rings can be given a tight fit by this 
process.
For details of other high precision cylindrical roller bearings, 
see catalogue AC 41130, Super Precision Bearings.
Cylindrical roller bearings NN30..-AS-K-M-SP are non-locating 
bearings and can support radial forces only. Axial forces are 
normally supported by double direction axial angular contact ball 
bearings.
The outer and inner ring can be axially displaced relative to 
each other from the central position by the values “s” stated in 
the dimension tables.
Sealing/lubricant
The bearings are supplied without seals. They can be lubricated 
from the end faces as well as through a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes in the outer ring.
Cylindrical roller bearings with special precision (SP) can be used at 
operating temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
For continuous operation above +120 °C, please contact us.
Cage
The cylindrical roller bearings have two roller-guided solid brass 
cages.

The achievable speed depends on the radial internal clearance 
while warm from operation. For calculation, the values from 
the dimension table are multiplied by the correction factor in 
the table.

The deviation of the taper angle of the shaft seat for bearings of 
tolerance class SP is shown in the table.
Deviation of taper angle
The taper angle tolerance ATD applies vertical to the axis and 
is defined as the differential diameter.
If FAG taper gauges MGK132 are used, the ATD values listed should 
be halved (inclination angle tolerance).
For taper lengths with nominal dimensions between the values 
listed in the table, the taper angle tolerance ATD should be 
determined by means of interpolation.

Full complement cylindrical roller bearings have solid outer and 
inner rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. Since they have 
the maximum possible number of rolling elements, these bearings 
have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and high rigidity 
and are suitable for particularly compact designs. Due to the 
kinematic conditions, however, they do not achieve the high speeds 
that are possible when using cylindrical roller bearings with cage.
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are available as 
non-locating, semi-locating and locating bearings as well as in 
single and double row designs.
Numerous sizes are supplied in the X-life grade. 
These bearings are indicated in the dimension tables.
Bearings of X-life quality have lower roughness Ra and higher 
geometrical accuracy of the raceways than comparable designs that 
are not X-life. As a result, they have higher load carrying capacity and 
longer life for the same dimensioning. In certain applications, 
this means that a smaller bearing arrangement can be designed.
Bearings SL0248 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNCL 48..V) 
and bearings SL0249 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNCL 49..V) 
are double row non-locating bearings and can support radial forces 
only.
The outer ring without ribs can be axially displaced in both 
directions in relation to the inner ring. The inner ring has ribs on 
both sides.
The bearings are held together in handling and transport by 
a transport and mounting retaining device. This retaining device 
must not be subjected to axial load.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease. For lubrication, they have 
a lubrication groove and lubrication holes in the outer ring.
Semi-locating bearings are available in single row design as 
SL1818 (dimension series 18), SL1829 (dimension series 29), 
SL1830 (dimension series 30), SL1822 (dimension series 22), 
SL1923 (dimension series 23) 
and in double row design as SL1850 (dimension series 50). 
They can support not only high radial forces but also axial forces in 
one direction and can therefore guide shafts axially in one direction. 
They act as non-locating bearings in the opposite direction.
Series SL1923 has only one rib on the inner ring. As a result, 
the inner ring can be removed from the bearing. This makes fitting 
and dismantling considerably easier.
The bearings SL1818, SL1829, SL1830, SL1822 and SL1850 are 
held together in handling and transport by a transport and mounting 
retaining device.
This retaining device must not be subjected to axial load.
Axial displacement of
The inner ring can be axially displaced in one direction only by 
the dimension “s” stated in the dimension table.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease. The semi-locating bearings 
can be lubricated via the end faces, while the double row designs 
can additionally be lubricated via a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes in the outer ring.


Cylindrical roller bearings SL0148 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: 
NNC 48..V) and SL0149 (designation to DIN 5 412-9: NNC 49..V) 
are double row locating bearings. These bearings can support axial 
forces from both directions as well as radial forces.
The outer ring has ribs on both sides, is axially split and held 
together by fasteners. The inner ring has an additional central rib.
The fasteners must not be subjected to axial load.
Sealing/lubricant
The cylindrical roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated with oil or grease.
For lubrication, the outer ring has a lubrication groove and 
lubrication holes.
Full complement cylindrical roller bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +120 °C.
Suffixes for available designs: see table.

addition to radial forces.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on: 
■the size of the sliding surfaces between the ribs and the end 
faces of the rolling elements
■the sliding velocity at the ribs
■the lubrication on the contact surfaces.
Ribs subjected to load must be supported across their entire height. 
If severe shaft flexing is present, reversed bending stresses may 
occur as a result of this support. Special analysis is required in this 
case. The axial limiting load Fa max according to the formula must not 
be exceeded, in order to avoid impermissible pressure at the contact 
surfaces.
The ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,4. Continuous axial loading 
without simultaneous radial loading is not permissible.

Semi-locating
and locating bearings
If an axial force Fa is present in addition to the radial force Fr, 
the effect on the life must be calculated using our calculation 
program BEARINX®.
Semi-locating
and locating bearings
If an axial force F0a is present in addition to the radial force F0r, 
the effect on the static load safety factor must be calculated using 
our calculation program BEARINX®.
Minimum radial load
In continuous operation, a minimum radial load of the order of 
C0r/P  60 is necessary.
If C0r/P  60, please contact us.
Axial location
In order to prevent lateral creep of the bearing rings, they must be 
located by force or physical locking means.
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulders 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509. Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in 
the dimension tables.
For semi-locating bearings, the bearings only require support on 
one side, on the rib supporting the axial load.
Full support must be provided for ribs transmitting forces in axially 
loaded bearings.
F r


The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620.
The radial internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance 
group CN.
to DIN 620-4

with snap ring grooves
Cylindrical roller bearings with snap ring grooves are full 
complement, double row units comprising solid outer and 
inner rings with ribs, rib-guided cylindrical rollers and sealing rings. 
The outer rings have grooves for retaining rings. 
The inner rings are axially split, 1 mm wider than the outer rings 
and held together by a rolled-in steel strip.
The bearings are available as a light series SL04..-PP and 
in the dimension series 50 as SL0450..-PP. 
Cylindrical roller bearings with snap ring grooves are locating 
bearings.  These bearings are very rigid and can support axial forces 
in both directions as well as high radial forces.
Due to their full complement design, they have the maximum 
possible number of rolling elements and therefore the maximum 
basic dynamic and static load ratings. Due to the kinematic 
conditions, however, they do not achieve the high speeds that are 
possible when using cylindrical roller bearings with cage.
Bearings for cable sheaves
Due to the grooves in the outer rings, the bearing rings can easily be 
axially located. The bearings are therefore highly suitable for cable 
sheave bearing arrangements.
Sealing/lubricant
Sealing rings on both sides protect the running system against 
contamination and moisture.
The cylindrical roller bearings are greased with a lithium complex 
soap grease to GA08 and can be relubricated via the outer and 
inner ring.
The cylindrical roller bearings are suitable for operating 
temperatures from –20 °C to +80 °C, limited by the grease and 
the seal material.
Suffixes for available designs: see table.

with snap ring grooves
Radial location
The bearings normally have a circumferential load on 
the outer ring – for example in cable sheaves. The outer ring must 
therefore have a press fit.
Axial location
The abutting shoulders (shaft/housing) should be sufficiently high 
and perpendicular to the bearing axis.
The transition from the bearing seating to the abutting shoulder 
must be designed with rounding to DIN 5 418 or an undercut to 
DIN 509.
Note the minimum chamfer dimensions r as given in the dimension 
tables.
The split inner ring must be axially located on both sides, Figure 1. 
The fasteners on the split inner ring must not be subjected to axial 
load.
Location by retaining rings
The grooves allow the outer rings to be axially located using 
retaining rings, Figure 1. Suitable fasteners are WRE rings or rings 
to DIN 471. Locating rings are not included in the delivery. 
The design 2NR is supplied with two retaining rings WRE packed 
loose.
Support of sealing rings
The sealing rings must be supported to a sufficient height, so that 
they are not pressed out during lubrication of the bearings, Figure 2. 
The dimension d2 given in the dimension table must be observed.

Support of sealing rings

Fitting and dismantling
During fitting and dismantling of the bearings, the mounting forces 
must never be directed through the rolling elements, sealing rings or 
the fasteners on the split inner ring.
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the bearings 
correspond to tolerance class PN to DIN 620.
The radial internal clearance corresponds to internal clearance 
group CN.

Tapered roller bearings comprise solid inner and outer rings 
with tapered raceways and tapered rollers with cages made from 
pressed sheet steel. The bearings are not self-retaining. 
As a result, the inner ring with the rollers and the cage can be fitted 
separately from the outer ring.
Radial and axial load capacity
Tapered roller bearings can support axial forces in one direction 
and high radial forces. They must normally be axially adjusted 
against a second bearing fitted in a mirror image arrangement. 
This bearing combination is fitted in an O or X arrangement, 
Figure 1, Figure 2, page 467.
The axial load carrying capacity is dependent on the contact angle; 
i.e. the larger the angle, the higher the axial load to which 
the bearing can be subjected. The bearing-specific value e in 
the dimension tables indicates the contact angle and therefore 
the load carrying capacity. Bearings of series 313, 323..-B, T5ED 
and T7FC have a very high axial load carrying capacity due to their 
particularly large contact angle.
Tapered roller bearings 313..-N11CA are matched in pairs in 
an X arrangement and can therefore support high axial forces in both 
directions and moment loads.
The axial internal clearance of the bearing pair is defined by 
a ring between the two outer rings and is indicated in the suffix, 
see Axial internal clearance, page 474.
Speeds for matched bearings: see page 470.
When ordering matched bearings, please state the number of 
bearings, not the number of bearing pairs.
Metric and inch sizes
Tapered roller bearings are available in metric and inch sizes.
Bearings with a K in the designation are inch sizes.
For new designs, bearings in metric sizes should be used in 
preference.
Sealing/lubrication
Tapered roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
The modified line contact between the tapered rollers and 
the raceways ensures optimum stress distribution at the contact 
points, prevents edge stresses and allows the bearings to undergo 
angular adjustment.
At a load ratio P/Cr 	 0,2, the tilting of the bearing rings relative 
to each other must not exceed a maximum of 4 angular minutes. 
For higher loads or tilting angles, please contact us.


Tapered roller bearings can be used at operating temperatures from 
–30 °C to +120 °C.
Bearings with an outside diameter of more than 90 mm are 
dimensionally stable up to +150 °C, bearings with an outside 
diameter of more than 120 mm up to +200 °C.
Tapered roller bearings have pressed cages made from sheet steel. 
Since these project laterally to a certain extent, the mounting 
dimensions in the dimension tables and the cage projection, 
page 470, must be observed.
Suffixes for available designs: see table.
1) Available by agreement and in certain series only.
Calculation of axial force
Under radial load, an internal axial force is induced in the bearing 
that must be supported by a second bearing and taken into 
consideration when calculating the equivalent bearing load.
Depending on the bearing arrangement (O or X arrangement), 
the axial force must first be determined for bearings adjusted 
clearance-free without preload, see table Load ratio and axial 
bearing load, Figure 1, Figure 2, page 467.
The following preconditions apply:
■The radial forces act at the central pressure points and are 
positive,
■Bearing A is subjected to a radial load FrA, bearing B to FrB
■F is an external axial force acting on bearing A.

Basic dynamic and
static load ratings for
bearing pairs
If two bearings of the same size and design are fitted immediately 
adjacent to each other in an O or X arrangement, the basic dynamic 
load rating Cr and basic static load rating C0r of the bearing pair are 
as follows:
■Cr = 1,715 · Cr single bearing
■C0r = 2 · C0r single bearing
For matched bearing pairs 313..-N11CA, the basic dynamic and 
static load ratings are given in the dimension tables.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,01 is 
necessary for roller bearings with cage.
The limiting speeds nG given in the dimension tables must not be 
exceeded.
For matched bearings 313..-N11CA, the operating speed is 
approximately 20% below the calculated permissible operating 
speed of the single bearing.
The limiting speed nG is possible if the less favourable 
thermal balance of the bearing pair is taken into consideration in 
the operating conditions.
Cage projection
The cages project laterally to a certain extent. In order to prevent 
grazing, the lateral minimum distances Ca and Cb in the dimension 
tables must be taken into consideration in the design of the adjacent 
construction.

Axial internal clearance
In tapered roller bearings, the axial internal clearance is the result of 
mounting against a second bearing during installation.
The axial internal clearance is defined by an intermediate ring and 
is indicated in the suffix. Example: A80-120 indicates that the axial 
internal clearance of the bearing pair before fitting is between 
80 m and 120 m.
Once bearing pairs are fitted, the preset axial internal clearance 
is reduced by the fit conditions and the axial clamping forces.

Barrel roller bearings
Barrel roller bearings are single row, self-aligning roller bearings. 
They comprise solid outer rings with a concave raceway, solid inner 
rings with two ribs and a cylindrical or tapered bore as well as barrel 
rollers with cages. The bearings cannot be dismantled.
Barrel roller bearings are particularly suitable where high radial 
shock type loads occur and misalignments must be compensated, 
see Compensation of angular misalignments. 
They have only a low axial load carrying capacity.
With tapered bore/
with adapter sleeve
Bearings with a tapered bore have a bore taper of 1:12 and 
the suffix K.
These bearings are also available with an adapter sleeve for 
location. The adapter sleeves are included in the dimension tables 
and must be specified in addition when ordering.
Sealing/lubrication
Barrel roller bearings are not sealed and not greased. 
They can be lubricated using oil or grease.
Compensation of
angular misalignments
Under normal operating conditions and with a rotating inner ring, 
barrel roller bearings can swivel approx. 4° about their central 
position. As a result, they permit skewing between the inner 
and outer ring and can thus compensate misalignments, 
shaft deflections and housing deformations.
If the outer ring rotates or the inner ring undergoes tumbling motion, 
the angular adjustment facility is smaller. 
In this case, please contact us.
Barrel roller bearings with brass cages can be used at operating 
temperatures from –30 °C to +150 °C.
Bearing with an outside diameter over 120 mm are dimensionally 
stable up to +200 °C.
Bearings with cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide can 
be used up to +120 °C.
The standard cages for barrel roller bearings are shown in 
the table Cage/bore code.
Barrel roller bearings with solid brass cages have the suffix MB. 
The cages are guided on the inner ring.
Solid window cages made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide are 
indicated by the suffix TVP.
Check the chemical resistance of polyamide to synthetic greases 
and lubricants with EP additives.
Aged oil and additives in the oil can impair the operating life of 
plastic cages at high temperatures.
The oil change intervals must be observed.
Cage/bore code
1) Other cage designs – for example brass cages instead of polyamide cages – 
are available by agreement. In such cages, suitability for high speeds and 
temperatures as well as the basic load ratings may differ from the values for 
bearings with standard cages.

Suffixes for the available designs: see table.
Radial dynamic bearing load.
Axial static bearing load
Radial static bearing load.
Minimum radial load
In order to ensure slippage-free operation, the bearings must be 
subjected to a minimum radial load. This applies particularly in 
the case of high speeds and high accelerations. In continuous 
operation, a minimum radial load of the order of P/Cr  0,02 is 
necessary for roller bearings with cage.
DIN 732-1 (draft 1994-12) does not give thermal reference speeds 
for barrel roller bearings.
The dimension tables therefore only state limiting speeds nG. 
These values are for oil lubrication and must not be exceeded.
Location of
bearings with tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered inner ring bore are:
■located either directly on tapered shaft seats or
■located on cylindrical shafts by means of an adapter sleeve.
The dimensions for support rings in the dimension tables must be 
observed.
The shoulders on the adjacent construction (shaft/housing) must be 
sufficiently high that adequate abutment surfaces are ensured even 
with very large chamfer dimensions.
The maximum values for the radii ra and the diameters of 
the abutment surfaces da, Da are indicated in the dimension tables.
Radial internal clearance larger than normal

What is new in this edition
The four main differences in this edition of the SKF catalogue Rolling 
bearings, compared to the previous, are described below.
1. The bearing selection process
When selecting bearings for any purpose, ultimately you want to be 
certain of achieving the required level of equipment performance 
– and at the lowest possible cost. In addition to the bearing rating life, 
there are other key factors you must consider when putting together 
the bearing speciications for an application. The bearing selection 
process helps to evaluate these key factors.
Go to section B, page 60, to learn more about bearing selection.
3. Streamlined content and easy online 
access

Spherical roller bearings for wind energy 
Spherical roller bearings for wind energy applications are designed 
explicitly for wind turbine main shafts. They have an optimized 
in tern al geometry with large diameter rollers and increased contact 
angle for increased axial load carrying capacity. 
Upgraded INSOCOAT bearings
INSOCOAT bearings feature electrical insulation on either the inner 
or outer ring. The upgraded coating provides higher Ohmic resistance, including high Ohmic resistance even in a humid environment, 
and higher breakdown voltage.
Angular contact ball bearings with 25° contact angle
These new bearings have a raceway geometry optimized for high 
speeds and reduced sensitivity to axial loading and misalignment. 
They can increase robustness when used as the backup bearing in 
sets that are predominantly loaded in one direction. 
4. Important product updates
Tapered roller bearings with an outside diameter up to 600 mm have 
been redesigned. These new bearings have an increased dynamic 
load rating, and most of the range is available as SKF Explorer bearings. A consolidated catalogue assortment and a simpliied designation system provide a clear view of what is available. 


 Foreword
Catalogue information 
and how to use it
This catalogue is divided into three parts:
Principles of rolling bearing selection
This part is marked by grey bars at the page edge. It provides general 
information about rolling bearings (section A), explains the bearing 
selection process (section B), and presents three examples on how to 
apply the bearing selection process for various applications (section C).
Grey bars mark the three sections under Principles 
of rolling bearing selection.
Sections by bearing type are marked with blue tabs 
including section number and an icon.
Indexes are marked with grey bars.
Indexes
The product index and text index are marked with grey bars. The 
product index lists series designations, relates them to the bearing 
type, and guides you to the relevant product section and product 
table. The text index lists entries in alphabetical order, including 
designation sufixes, and helps you locate speciic information 
quickly. 
The part is divided into  sections per bearing type. Each product section is marked by blue tabs containing the section number and a 
descriptive icon.


Use case: Select a bearing for an application
If you are unsure whether you have adequate knowledge or experience to select a bearing that best suits your application requirements, you will probably ind the Bearing selection process, page 60, 
helpful.
If you are an experienced bearing expert, go directly to the section 
for the relevant bearing type, browse the product tables for the 
required size, and then look at additional details and information on 
more speciic variants in the text part preceding the product tables.
Use case: Find details of a known bearing
The easiest way to ind detailed information about a bearing for 
which you have the designation is to use the product index, 
page 1136. Compare the initial characters in a bearing designation 
with the entries in the product index; each entry speciies the related 
bearing type, and the relevant product section and product table.
To understand the sufixes used in a bearing designation, go to the 
text index, page 1120, locate the entry for the sufix and follow the 
reference to the relevant product sectioin, where you can ind 
detailed information.
Units of measurement
This catalogue is for global use. Therefore, the predominant units of 
measurement are in accordance with ISO 80000-1. Imperial units 
are used wherever necessary. Unit conversions can be made using 
the conversion table, page 6.
For easier use, temperature values are provided in both °C and °F. 
Speciied temperature values are typically rounded. Therefore, values 
obtained using conversion formulae may not exactly match those 
speciied.

Why rolling 
bearings? 
Rolling bearings support and guide, with 
minimal friction (ig. 1), rotating or oscillating 
machine elements – such as shafts, axles or 
wheels – and transfer loads between machine 
components  Rolling bearings provide high 
precision and low friction and therefore enable 
high rotational speeds while reducing noise, 
heat, energy consumption and wear  They are 
cost- effective and exchangeable machine 
elements that typically follow national or 
international dimension standards 
Ball and roller 
The two basic types of rolling element 
 distinguish the two basic types of rolling 
bearing:
• ball → ball bearing
• roller → roller bearing
Balls and rollers are different in how they 
make contact with the raceways 
Balls make point contact with the ring 
raceways (ig. 2)  With increasing load acting 
on the bearing, the contact point becomes 
an elliptical area  The small contact area 
provides low rolling friction, which enables 
ball bearings to accommodate high speeds 
but also limits their load-carrying capacity 
Rollers make line contact with the ring 
raceways (ig. 3)  With increasing load acting 
on the bearing, the contact line becomes 
somewhat rectangular in shape  Because of 
the larger contact area and the consequently 
higher friction, a roller bearing can accommodate heavier loads, but lower speeds, 
than a same-sized ball bearing 


Why rolling bearings?
Radial and thrust 
Rolling bearings are classiied into two 
groups based on the direction of the load 
they predominantly accommodate: 
• Radial bearings
Radial bearings accommodate loads that 
are predominantly perpendicular to the 
shaft. Some radial bearings can support 
only pure radial loads, while most can 
additionally accommodate some axial 
loads in one direction and, in some cases, 
both directions (ig. 4).
• Thrust bearings
Thrust bearings accommodate loads that 
act predominantly along the axis of the 
shaft. Depending on their design, thrust 
bearings may support pure axial loads in 
one or both directions (ig. 5), and some 
can additionally accommodate radial loads 
(combined loads, ig. 6). Thrust bearings 
cannot accommodate speeds as high as 
same-sized radial bearings.
The contact angle (ig. 7) determines which 
group the bearing belongs to. Bearings with 
a contact angle ≤ 45° are radial bearings, the 
others are thrust bearings.

Components and 
materials 
A typical rolling bearing consists of the 
 following components (ig. 14):
• an inner ring
• an outer ring
• balls or rollers, as rolling elements
• a cage
SKF supplies several bearing types capped 
with a seal or shield on one or both sides. 
Bearings capped on both sides are factory- 
illed with grease. They provide an economic 
and space-saving solution compared to 
external sealing.
Bearing rings
The pressure at the rolling contact area and 
the cyclic overrolling creates fatigue in the 
bearing rings when the bearing is in operation. To cope with such fatigue, rings that are 
made of steel must be hardened.
The standard steel for bearing rings and 
washers is 100Cr6, a steel containing 
approximately 1% carbon and 1,5% 
chromium.
SKF bearing rings and washers are made 
of steel in accordance with SKF speciications. 
They cover all aspects that are relevant to 
providing a long service life for the bearing. 
Depending on speciic requirements, SKF 
uses stainless steels or high-temperature 
steels.
Rolling elements
The rolling elements (balls or rollers) transfer 
the load between inner and outer rings. 
 Typically, the same steel is used for rolling 
elements as for bearing rings and washers. 
When required, rolling elements can be made 
of ceramic material. Bearings containing 
ceramic rolling elements are considered 
hybrid bearings and are becoming more and 
more common.

Components and materials
Options for cage centring
Stamped metal cage
Machined metal cage
Polymer cage
Pin-type cage
The primary purposes of a cage are:
• separating the rolling elements to reduce 
the frictional heat generated in the 
• keeping the rolling elements evenly 
spaced to optimize load distribution
• guiding the rolling elements in the 
unloaded zone of the bearing
• retaining the rolling elements of separable 
bearings when one bearing ring is 
removed during mounting or dismounting
Cages are radially centred (ig. 15) either on:
• the rolling elements
• the inner ring
• the outer ring
Cages centred on the rolling elements permit 
the lubricant to enter the bearing easily. Ring 
centred cages, which provide more precise 
guidance, are typically used when bearings 
must accommodate high speeds, high vibration levels or inertia forces stemming from 
movements of the whole bearing.
The main cage types are:
• Stamped metal cages (ig. 16)
Stamped metal cages (sheet steel or 
sometimes sheet brass) are lightweight 
and withstand high temperatures.
• Machined metal cages (ig. 17)
Machined metal cages are made of brass 
or sometimes steel or light alloy. They 
 permit high speeds, temperatures, accelerations and vibrations.
• Polymer cages (ig. 18)
Polymer cages are made of polyamide 66 
(PA66), polyamide 46 (PA46) or sometimes polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or 
other polymer materials. The good sliding 
properties of polymer cages produce little 
friction and, therefore, permit high speeds. 
Under poor lubrication conditions, these 
cages reduce the risk of seizure and secondary damage because they can operate 
for some time with limited lubrication.
• Pin-type cages (ig. 19)
Steel pin-type cages need pierced rollers 
and are only used together with largesized roller bearings. These cages have 
relatively low weight and enable a large 
number of rollers to be incorporated.


Integral sealing
Integral sealing can signiicantly prolong 
bearing service life because it keeps lubricant 
in the bearing and contaminants out of it. 
SKF bearings are available with various 
 capping devices:
• Shields
There is a small gap between the shield 
and inner ring. Bearings itted with shields 
(ig. 20) are used where the operating 
conditions are relatively clean, or where 
low friction is important because of speed 
or operating temperature considerations.
• Seals
Bearings with seals are preferred for 
arrangements where contamination is 
moderate. Where the presence of water or 
moisture cannot be ruled out, contact seals 
(ig. 21) are typically used. These seals 
make positive contact with the sliding 
 surface on one of the bearing rings. Low- 
friction seals (ig. 22) and non-contact 
seals (ig. 23) can accommodate the same 
speeds as bearings with shields, but with 
improved sealing effectiveness. 
Bearing internal clearance (ig. 24) is deined 
as the total distance through which one 
bearing ring can be moved relative to the 
other in the radial direction (radial internal 
clearance) or in the axial direction (axial 
internal clearance).
In almost all applications, the initial clearance in a bearing is greater than its operating 
clearance. The difference is mainly caused by 
two effects:
• Bearings are typically mounted with an 
interference it on the shaft or in the housing. The expansion of the inner ring or the 
compression of the outer ring reduces the 
internal clearance. 
• Bearings generate heat in operation. Differential thermal expansion of the bearing 
and mating components inluences the 
internal clearance.

Bearing internal clearance 
Suficient internal clearance in a bearing 
during operation is important. Preload 
(clearance below zero) is possible for certain 
bearing types.
To enable selection of the appropriate 
initial internal clearance to achieve the desired 
operational internal clearance, bearings are 
available in different clearance classes. ISO 
has established ive clearance classes for 
many bearing types. SKF uses designation 
sufixes to indicate when the bearing internal 
clearance differs from Normal (table 1).

Heat and surface treatment
Heat and surface 
treatment
Rolling bearing rings and rolling elements 
must:
• be hard enough to cope with fatigue and 
plastic deformations
• be tough enough to cope with applied 
• be suficiently stable to experience only 
limited changes of dimensions over time
The required properties are achieved by heat 
and surface treatments.

Heat treatment is used to limit dimensional 
changes caused by metallurgical effects at 
extreme temperatures. There is a standardized classiication system for dimensional 
stability (table 2). The various SKF bearing 
types are stabilized to different classes as 
standard.
Surface treatment 
and coatings
Coating is a well-established method for 
providing bearings with additional functional 
beneits to accommodate speciic application 
conditions. Widely used coatings are zinc 
chromate and black oxide.
Two other methods developed by SKF 
have proven successful in many applications:
• INSOCOAT bearings are standard bearings 
that have the external surfaces of their 
inner or outer ring coated with an aluminium oxide layer. This coating increases 
resistance to electric current through the 
bearing.
• NoWear enhances wear-resistance of the 
raceway or rolling element surfaces. It can 
help the bearing withstand long periods of 
operation under poor lubrication conditions 
and to reduce the risk for low load damage.

Hardening
There are three typical hardening methods 
that may be applied to bearing components:
• Through-hardening
This is the standard method for most 
bearings and provides good fatigue and 
wear-resistance, as hardening is applied 
over the full cross section.
• Induction-hardening
Surface induction-hardening is used to 
selectively harden a component’s raceway 
to limit rolling contact fatigue, leaving the 
remainder of the component unaffected to 
maintain structural strength.
• Case-hardening
Case-hardening provides hardness to the 
surface. It is used, for example, where 
bearing rings are subjected to high shock 
loads causing structural deformations.

Standardized 
boundary 
Boundary dimensions are the main dimensions of a bearing (ig. 25 and ig. 26). They 
comprise:
• the bore diameter (d)
• the outside diameter (D)
• the width or height (B, C, T or H)
• the chamfer dimensions (r)
The boundary dimensions for metric bearings are standardized in the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 
general plans: 
• ISO 15 for radial rolling bearings, except 
insert bearings, some types of needle 
roller bearings and tapered roller bearings
• ISO 104 for thrust bearings
• ISO 355 for tapered roller bearings
Most rolling bearings follow ISO standard 
dimensions, which is a prerequisite to enable 
interchangeability.
The ISO general plan for radial bearings 
provides several series of standardized outside diameters for every standard bore 
diameter. They are called diameter series 
and are numbered 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (in 
order of increasing outside diameter). Within 
each diameter series, different width series 
exist (width series 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in 
order of increasing width). The diameter 
series 0, 2 and 3, combined with width 
series 0, 1, 2 and 3, are shown in ig. 27. 
For thrust bearings, height series are used 
instead of width series. Height series are 
numbered 7, 9, 1 and 2.
Bearings to ISO general plans have the 
same boundary dimensions when they share 
the same bore diameter and dimension 
series (table 3). If not, they have different 
boundary dimensions.

system 
The designations of most SKF rolling bearings follow a designation system. The complete bearing designation may consist of a 
basic designation with or without one or 
more supplementary preixes and sufixes 
(diagram 1). The basic designation 
identiies:
• the bearing type
• the basic design
• the boundary dimensions
Preixes and sufixes identify design features 
or bearing components.

Basic bearing designation system
Basic designations
A basic designation typically contains three 
to ive digits. The basic designation system is 
shown in table 4. The number and letter 
combinations have the following meaning:
• The irst digit or letter or combination of 
letters identiies the bearing type and 
eventually a basic variant.
• The following two digits identify the ISO 
dimension series. The irst digit indicates the 
width or height series (dimensions B, T or 
H). The second digit identiies the diameter 
series (dimension D).
• The last two digits of the basic designation 
identify the size code of the bearing bore. 
The size code multiplied by 5 gives the 
bore diameter (d) in mm.
The most important exceptions in the basic 
bearing designation system are: 
1 In a few cases the digit for the bearing type 
or the irst digit of the dimension series 
identiication is omitted. These digits are 
shown in brackets in table 4. 
2 Bearings with a bore diameter of 10, 12, 
15 or 17 mm have the following size code 
identiications:
00 = 10 mm
01 = 12 mm
02 = 15 mm
03 = 17 mm
3 For bearings with a bore diameter 
< 10 mm, or ≥ 500 mm, the bore diameter 
is generally given in millimetres (uncoded). 
The size identiication is separated from 
the rest of the bearing designation by an 
oblique stroke, e.g. 618/8 (d = 8 mm) or 
511/530 (d = 530 mm). This is also true for 
standard bearings in accordance with 
ISO 15 that have a bore diameter of 22, 28 
or 32 mm, e.g. 62/22 (d = 22 mm).
4 For some bearings with a bore diameter 
< 10 mm, such as deep groove, self- 
aligning and angular contact ball bearings, 
the bore diameter is also given in millimetres (uncoded) but is not separated from 
the series designation by an oblique 
stroke, e.g. 629 or 129 (d = 9 mm).
5 Bore diameters that deviate from the 
standard bore diameter of a bearing are 
uncoded and given in millimetres up to 
three decimal places. This bore diameter 
identiication is part of the basic designation 
and is separated by an oblique stroke, e.g. 
6202/15.875 (d = 15,875 mm = 5/8 in).
Bearing series 
Bearing series designations consist of an 
identiication for the bearing type and the 
dimension series. The most common series 
designations are shown in table 4. The digits 
in brackets belong to the system, but are not 
used in the series designation in practice. 


Bearing designations 
not covered by the 
basic system
Insert bearings
The designations for insert bearings differ 
somewhat from those described in the basic 
designation system and are described under 
Insert bearings, page 339.
Needle roller bearings 
The designations for needle roller bearings 
do not fully follow the basic designation system and are described under Needle roller 
bearings, page 581.
The designations for metric tapered roller 
bearings follow either the basic designation 
system or a designation system, established 
by ISO in 1977, covered in ISO 355. Inch 
tapered roller bearings are designated in 
accordance with the relevant ANSI/ABMA 
standard. The designation system is 
explained under Tapered roller bearings, 
page 665. 
Customized bearings 
Bearings designed to meet a speciic customer requirement are typically designated 
by a drawing number. The drawing number 
does not provide any information about the 
bearing.
Other rolling bearings 
Rolling bearings not covered in the ball bearings and roller bearings sections, such as 
super-precision bearings, thin section bearings, slewing bearings or linear bearings, 
follow designation systems that can differ 
signiicantly from the basic designation 
system.
Preﬁxes and sufﬁxes
The designations of most SKF rolling bearings follow a system that consists of a basic 
designation with or without one or more 
preixes and/or sufixes, as shown in 
diagram 2.
Preixes and sufixes provide additional 
information about the bearing.
Preixes are mainly used to identify components of a bearing. They can also identify 
bearing variants.
Sufixes identify designs or variants, which 
differ in some way from the original design 
or from the current basic design. The sufixes 
are divided into groups. When more than 
one special feature is to be identiied, sufixes 
are provided in the order shown in 
diagram 2.
Details of the signiicance of speciic preixes and sufixes are given in the relevant 
product sections.

Tolerance values
Actual tolerance values are listed in the 
 following tables. 
Metric radial bearings, except tapered 
roller bearings:
• Normal tolerances (table 2, page 38)
• P6 class tolerances (table 3, page 39)
• P5 class tolerances (table 4, page 40)
Metric tapered roller bearings:
• Normal and CL7C class tolerances 
(table 5, page 41)
• CLN class tolerances (table 6, page 42)
• P5 class tolerances (table 7, page 43)
Inch radial bearings, except tapered roller 
bearings:
• Normal tolerances (table 8, page 44)
Inch tapered roller bearings:
• Normal, CL2, CL3 and CL0 class tolerances 
(table 9, page 45)
Thrust bearings:
• Normal, P6 and P5 class tolerances 
(table 10, page 46)
Tapered bore, taper 1:12:
• Normal, P6 and P5 class tolerances 
(table 11, page 47)
Tapered bore, taper 1:30:
• Normal tolerances (table 12, page 48)
Where standardized, the values are in 
accordance with ISO 492, ISO 199 and 
ANSI/ABMA Std. 19.2.
Tolerance symbols
The tolerance symbols that we use are in 
line with ISO 492 and ISO 199 and are 
explained in table 13, page 49. The symbols 
normally refer to dimensional tolerances, 
only Kia, Kea, Sd, SD, Sia and Sea refer to 
geometrical tolerances.
Tolerance classes and the corresponding 
values for certain tolerance characteristics 
are speciied in ISO 492 (for radial bearings) 
and ISO 199 (for thrust bearings). In 2014 
these standards were aligned with general 
ISO GPS (Geometrical Product Speciication) 
standards such as ISO 1101 and ISO 5459. 
For additional information on ISO 492 and 
ISO 199, and the changes that have been 
made to their previous editions, refer to  
the SKF e-learning platform 
(skf.com/go/17000-learnGPS).
There are three common tolerance 
classes for SKF ball and roller bearings 
(table 1).
The product sections for the various bearing types provide information on compliance 
with applicable tolerance classes. The tolerance class of a bearing cannot always be 
determined from its designation sufixes. 
Where the tolerance class is standard for the 
bearing, it is not speciied in the designation 
sufixes.
For information about SKF bearings that 
have a tolerance class better than class 5, 
refer to the SKF catalogue Super-precision 
bearings or skf.com/super-precision.

identiﬁcation
The bore and outside diameter variation 
tolerances tVdsp and tVDsp for metric radial 
bearings (table 2, page 38, to table 4, 
page 40) vary depending on the diameter 
series to which the bearing belongs. To 
determine the diameter series, refer to 
table 14, page 52.
Chamfer 
Minimum chamfer 
Minimum chamfer dimensions (ig. 1) are 
listed in the product tables, for the radial (r1, 
r3) and axial (r2, r4) directions. For metric 
SKF bearings, these values are in accordance 
with the general plans listed in the following 
standards:
• ISO 15, ISO 12043 and ISO 12044 for 
radial bearings
• ISO 355 for radial tapered roller bearings
• ISO 104 for thrust bearings
Minimum and maximum chamfer 
Maximum chamfer 
The maximum chamfer dimensions (ig. 1) 
for the radial (r1, r3) and axial (r2, r4) directions, 
appropriate to the respective minimum values 
and the bore or outside diameter, are listed 
in the following tables:
• Metric radial and thrust bearings, except 
radial tapered roller bearings 
 (table 15, page 53)
• Metric radial tapered roller bearings 
(table 16, page 53) 
• Inch tapered roller bearings (table 17, 
page 54)
The maximum chamfer dimensions 
for  metric SKF bearings are in accordance 
with ISO 582.
Example
What is the largest radial and axial value 
(r1 max and r2 max) for the chamfer of a 6211 
deep groove ball bearing?
From the relevant product table, 
r1,2 min = 1,5 mm and d = 55 mm.
From table 15, with rs min = 1,5 mm and 
d < 120 mm, the largest radial value 
r1 max = 2,3 mm and the largest axial value 
r2 max = 4 mm.

Rounding values
Shoulder diameters
The dimensions for the shoulder diameters 
of radial bearings are rounded up or down to 
a level that is suitable for general machinery 
applications. Diameter dimensions of the 
inner ring are rounded down, whereas those 
of the outer ring are rounded up.
Load and speed ratings and 
fatigue load limits
The values of these parameters are rounded 
to a level that its the accuracy of the calculations they are intended to be used in.
Masses
Masses are rounded to approximately ±5% of 
the actual value. They do not include the 
weight of any packaging.
Temperatures
Temperatures are typically rounded to 5 °C 
and are presented in both units (°C and °F). 
Because of the rounding, temperature 
 values may not match when using unit 
 conversion formulae.
Rounding values


Storage
A.3


Storage
Storage time is the period that a bearing can 
remain in storage in order to avoid adverse 
effects on operational performance of the 
bearing. SKF bearings are coated with a 
high-quality preservative oil to protect them 
from corrosion. Long storage times can be 
attained by storing bearings in their original, 
unopened and undamaged, packaging. The 
storage time of bearings also depends on 
their storage environment conditions. To 
maintain the potential operating performance 
of a bearing, SKF recommends a “irst in, 
irst out” inventory policy. 
Storage time for 
open bearings
Typical storage times for open (unsealed) 
bearings are listed in table 1. 
Storage time for 
capped bearings
Capped bearings (bearings with seals or 
shields) should be stored for a maximum of 
three years to avoid deterioration of their 
grease ill. 
Additional storagerelated factors
To avoid deterioration of your bearings while 
in storage, consider these factors:
• Store indoors, in a frost- and condensation- 
free environment, at a maximum ambient 
temperature of 40 °C (105 °F), avoiding air 
low.
• Store in vibration-free conditions. Vibration 
can cause damage to raceways.
• Store horizontally, preferably, to avoid 
damage that could be caused by the 
 bearing falling over.
• Do not open or damage the original 
packaging.

Bearing selection process, introduction
When selecting bearings for any purpose, 
ultimately you want to be certain of achieving 
the required level of equipment performance 
– and at the lowest possible cost. Robustness 
also is very important because the conditions 
in which your equipment is assembled, 
operated and maintained may not be precisely known and may, in fact, vary over time.
In addition to the bearing rating life, there 
are key factors you must consider when putting together the bearing speciications for 
an application, including:
• lubricant and supply method
• shaft and housing its
• bearing clearance class
• cage material and guidance
• dimensional stability
• precision requirements
• bearing sealing
• mounting method and maintenance
To help evaluate these key factors, we 
 recommend following the selection process 
shown on the right 
The process provides a straightforward 
step-by-step approach that shows the general 
relationship between each step  By clearly 
deining and naming the steps in this way, it 
should be easier to ind information on a 
speciic topic  In reality, however, you will ind 
interdependencies that require you to loop 
back and forth between the steps

Performance and operating conditions
limits of the range may be important, 
whereas in others, only the lower or the 
upper limit may be 
In order to optimize a design, you may 
need to loop through various steps of the 
bearing selection process  To minimize these, 
review and prioritize any application pre­
requisites, such as:
• available radial or axial space
• shaft diameters deined by shaft strength 
requirements
• lubricant choice determined by other 
 components in the application
The relationship between principal operating 
conditions, application requirements and 
various aspects of a bearing arrangement’s 
design are shown in Factors to consider 
when translating operating conditions and 
application requirements into a bearing solution, page 66  The lists are not comprehensive and you may have to consider other 
factors and interrelationships, like cost and 
availability, when striving to obtain a robust 
and cost- effective solution  
The irst step in the bearing selection process 
is to understand and document:
• the required performance
• the operating conditions and assumptions 
of them
• any other application prerequisites
An application can set various requirements 
on the bearing solution  Common factors 
include:
• bearing life
• speed capability and ability to withstand 
applied acceleration levels
• precision of the radial and axial position of 
the shaft
• ability to cope with low or high temperatures or temperature gradients
• generated noise and vibration levels
The relative importance of these performance 
factors can inluence the nature of the path 
you take through the steps of the bearing 
selection and application analysis process.
You should evaluate the operating conditions in as much detail as possible. The most 
important operating parameters are:
• load
• speed
• temperature
• lubricant and lubricant cleanliness
Usually these can be determined from 
 physical and mechanical analysis of the 
application, or from experience with similar 
applications. Make sure that any assumptions 
made are clearly documented.
Operating conditions typically vary over 
time, e.g. in variable speed applications or 
because of seasonal temperature changes 
or increased output power. The range of the 
variation is important. In some cases, both

An overview is provided in Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial applications, 
page 72,  of the suitability of various bearing 
types for different bearing arrangements 
A single bearing arrangement consists of 
just one bearing that supports radial, axial 
and moment loads 
Locating/nonlocating bearing 
arrangements
In locating/non­locating bearing arrange­
ments (ig. 1): 
• The locating support provides axial location
of the shaft relative to the housing 
• The non­locating support accommodates 
axial displacements that occur when ther­
mal expansion of the shaft relative to the 
housing changes the distance between the 
two bearings  Additionally, it compensates 
for the accumulation of tolerances of the 
components, which affects the distance 
between the two bearings 
Bearings for the locating 
support
Radial bearings that can accommodate com­
bined (radial and axial) loads are used for the 
locating bearing support  These include:
• deep groove ball bearings (page 239)
• two universally matchable single row 
angular contact ball bearings, arranged 
back­to­back or face­to­face (page 386)
• double row angular contact ball bearings 
(page 386)
• self­aligning ball bearings (page 438)
• spherical roller bearings (page 774)
• matched tapered roller bearings, arranged 
back­to­back or face­to­face (page 670)
• cylindrical roller bearings with langes on 
both rings or cylindrical roller bearings 
mounted with an angle ring (thrust collar) 
(page 494)
Each bearing type has characteristic proper­
ties that make it more or less suitable for use 
in a given application  An overview is provided 
in Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial 
applications, page 72, of the main bearing 
types (including their major features and 
design variants) and their degree of suitability 
for certain aspects of use 
This section provides information on what 
to consider when selecting a bearing 
arrangement and the types of bearing to use 
with it  It also provides guidelines on choos­
ing bearing types to satisfy speciic demands 
of an application, such as accommodating 
available space, loads, misalignment, and 
more 
Arrangements 
and their bearing 
types
A bearing arrangement supports and locates 
a shaft, radially and axially, relative to other 
components such as housings  Typically, two 
bearing supports are required to position a 
shaft  Depending on certain requirements, 
such as stiffness or load directions, a bearing 
support may consist of one or more 
Bearing arrangements comprising two 
bearing supports are:
• locating/non­locating bearing 
arrangements
• adjusted bearing arrangements
• loating bearing arrangements

and four-point contact ball bearing

Arrangements and their bearing types
Bearing combinations for the 
locating support
The locating bearing support can consist of a 
combination of bearings  For example 
(ig. 2):
• To accommodate the radial load, a cylin­
drical roller bearing that has one ring 
without langes may be used 
• To provide the axial location, a deep 
groove ball bearing, a four­point contact 
ball bearing, or a pair of angular contact 
ball bearings may be used 
The outer ring of the axial locating bearing 
must be mounted radially free and should 
not be clamped  Otherwise, this bearing can 
be subjected to unintended radial loads 
Bearings for the nonlocating support
There are two ways to accommodate axial 
displacements at the non­locating bearing 
support:
1 Use a bearing type that enables axial dis­
placement within the bearing (ig. 3): 
 – cylindrical roller bearings with langes 
on one ring only (page 494)
 – needle roller bearings (page 582)
 – CARB toroidal roller bearings 
(page 842)
When these bearings are rotating, they 
accommodate axial displacement and 
induce almost no axial load on the bearing 
arrangement  You should use this solution 
where an interference it is required for 
both rings 
2 Use a loose it between one bearing ring 
and its seat  Suitable bearing types 
include:
 – deep groove ball bearings (page 240)
 – self­aligning ball bearings (page 438)
 – spherical roller bearings (page 774)
 – pairs of angular contact ball bearings 
(page 385) or tapered roller bearings 
(page 670)
Axial movements of a bearing on its seat 
cause axial loads, which might have an 
impact on the bearing service life 
When using other bearing types, you may 
need to take additional design considerations 
into account

Typical combinations of 
bearing supports
From the large number of possible locating/
non­locating bearing combinations, the fol­
lowing are the most popular 
For bearing arrangements where 
the axial displacement is 
accommodated within the bearing
Conventional bearing arrangements in 
which limited angular misalignment occurs 
include:
• deep groove ball bearing / cylindrical roller 
bearing (ig. 4)
• double row angular contact ball bearing / 
NU or N design cylindrical roller bearing 
(ig. 5)
• matched single row tapered roller bear­
ings / NU or N design cylindrical roller 
bearing (ig. 6)
• NUP design cylindrical roller bearing / NU 
design cylindrical roller bearing (ig. 7)
• NU design cylindrical roller bearing and a 
four­point contact ball bearing / NU 
design cylindrical roller bearing (ig. 8)
SKF self­aligning bearing systems, which 
can compensate for more misalignment, are:
• spherical roller bearing / CARB toroidal 
roller bearing (ig. 9)
• self­aligning ball bearing / CARB toroidal 
For bearing arrangements where 
the axial displacement is 
accommodated between a bearing 
ring and its seat
• deep groove ball bearing / deep groove 
ball bearing (ig. 10)
• self­aligning ball bearings or spherical 
roller bearings (ig. 11) for both bearing 
positions
• matched single row angular contact ball 
bearings / deep groove ball bearing 
(ig. 12)

Adjusted bearing 
arrangements
In adjusted bearing arrangements, the shaft 
is located axially in one direction by one 
bearing support and in the opposite direction 
by the other (cross­located)  Adjusted bearing 
arrangements require proper adjustment of 
clearance or preload during mounting  
These bearing arrangements are gener­
ally used for short shafts, where thermal 
expansion has only a little effect  The most 
suitable bearings are:
• angular contact ball bearings (ig. 13) 
• tapered roller bearings (ig. 14)
Floating bearing 
arrangements
In loating bearing arrangements the shaft is 
cross­located, but is able to move axially a 
certain distance between the two end posi­
tions, i e  “loat” 
When determining the required “loat” 
distance, consider thermal expansion of the 
shaft relative to the housing and tolerances 
of the components, which affect the distance 
between the two bearings 
With this arrangement, the shaft can also 
be axially located by other components on 
the shaft, e g  a double helical gear  Most 
common bearings are:
• deep groove ball bearings (ig. 15) 
• self­aligning ball bearings
• spherical roller bearings (ig. 16)
• NJ design cylindrical roller bearings, 
 mirrored, with offset rings (ig. 17)

Available space
Often the boundary dimensions of a bearing 
are predetermined by the machine’s design  
Typically, the shaft diameter determines the 
bearing bore diameter  For the same bore 
diameter, different outside diameters and 
widths may be available (ig. 18)  The availa­
bility of bearings in a certain ISO dimension 
series depends on bearing type and bore 
Other space­related criteria that inluence 
the selection of bearing type include:
• shafts with small diameter (approx  
d < 10 mm)
 – deep groove ball bearings
 – needle roller bearings
 – self-aligning ball bearings
 – thrust ball bearings
• shafts with normal diameter 
 – all bearing types
ISO dimension series for the same bore diameter

• very limited radial space
 – needle roller bearings
 – deep groove ball bearings in the 618 or 
619 series
 – CARB toroidal roller bearings in the C49, 
C59 or C69 series
 – bearings without inner or outer ring and 
raceways machined directly on the shaft 
or in the housing


When selecting bearing type based on load 
criteria, you should bear in mind that:
• Roller bearings accommodate heavier 
loads than same­sized ball bearings 
• Full complement bearings accommodate 
heavier loads than the corresponding 
bearing with a cage 
An overview is provided in Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial applications, 
page 72, the radial, axial and moment load 
capability of various bearing types 
Combined radial and axial 
The direction of load is a primary factor in 
bearing type selection  Where the load on a 
bearing is a combination of radial and axial 
load, the ratio of the components deter­
mines the direction of the combined load 
(ig. 19)  
The suitability of a bearing for a certain 
direction of load corresponds to its contact 
angle α (diagram 1) – the greater the contact 
angle, the higher the axial load carrying 
capacity of the bearing  You can see this indi­
cated in the value of the calculation factor Y 
(refer to individual product sections), which 
decreases as the contact angle increases  
ISO deines bearings with contact angles 
≤ 45° as radial bearings, and the others  
as thrust bearings, independent of their 
actual use. 
To accommodate combined loads with a 
light axial component, bearings with a small 
contact angle can be used. Deep groove ball 
bearings are a common choice for light to 
moderate axial loads. With increasing axial 
load, a larger deep groove ball bearing (with 
higher axial load carrying capacity) can be 
used. For even higher axial load, bearings 
with a larger contact angle may be required, 
such as angular contact ball bearings or 
tapered roller bearings. These bearing types 
can be arranged in tandem to accommodate 
high axial loads. 
When combined loads have a large alternating axial load component, suitable solutions include:
• a pair of universally matchable angular 
contact ball bearings
• matched sets of tapered roller bearings
• double-row tapered roller bearings
Where a four -point contact ball bearing is 
used to accommodate the axial component 
of a combined load (ig. 2, page 70), the 
bearing outer ring must be mounted radially 
free and should not be clamped axially. 
 Otherwise, the bearing may be subjected to 
unintended radial load.
Direction of load
Combined load
The resulting load direction is 
determined by the ratio of radial 
to axial load.
Example: Deep groove ball 
Pure radial load
Load direction 0°
Example: NU design cylindrical 
roller bearing (accommodates 
radial load only)
Pure axial load
Load direction 90°

Speed and friction
The permissible operating temperature of 
rolling bearings imposes limits on the speed 
at which they can be operated  The operating 
temperature is determined, to a great extent, 
on the frictional heat generated in the bearing, 
except in machines where process heat is 
dominant 
An overview is provided in Suitability of 
rolling bearings for industrial applications, 
page 72, of the speed capability of various 
bearing types 
When selecting bearing type on the basis 
of operating speed, you should consider the 
following:
• Ball bearings have a lower frictional 
moment than same­sized roller bearings  
• Thrust bearings cannot accommodate 
speeds as high as same­sized radial 
• Single row bearing types typically gener­
ate low frictional heat and are therefore 
more suitable for high ­speed operation 
than double or multi­row bearings 
• Bearings with rolling elements made of 
ceramics (hybrid bearings) accommodate 
higher speeds than their all­steel 
equivalents 


Misalignment
An overview is provided in Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial applications, 
page 72,  of the capability of various bearing 
types to accommodate misalignment  The 
different types of misalignment are explained 
in table 1  
Bearing types vary in their ability to com­
pensate for misalignment between the shaft 
and housing:
• Self-aligning bearings (ig. 20)
Self­aligning bearings can compensate for 
misalignment within the bearing  Values 
for the permissible misalignment are listed 
in the relevant product section 
• Alignment bearings (ig. 21)
Alignment bearings can accommodate 
initial static misalignment because of their 
sphered outside surface  Values for the 
permissible misalignment are listed in the 
relevant product section 
• Rigid bearings
Rigid bearings (deep groove ball bearings, 
angular contact ball bearings, cylindrical, 
needle and tapered roller bearings) 
accommodate misalignment within the 
limits of their internal clearance  Values for 
the permissible misalignment are listed in 
the relevant product section  For rigid 
bearings, any misalignment may reduce 
service life 
The permissible operating temperature of 
rolling bearings can be limited by:
rings and rolling elements (table 2, for 
details refer to the relevant product 
section)
• the cage (Cages, page 187)
• the seals (relevant product section)
• the lubricant (Lubrication, page 110)
Types of misalignment

Static 
There is an initial alignment error 
between the two supports of a shaft  
Shaft delection creates misalign­
ment between bearing inner and 
outer rings that is constant in mag­
nitude and direction 

Dynamic 
Varying shaft delection creates 
misalignment between bearing 
inner and outer rings that is contin­
uously changing in magnitude or

Precision
Precision requirements typically do not inlu­
ence bearing type selection  Most SKF bear­
ings are available in various tolerance 
classes  Details are provided in the product 
sections 
For very high precision requirements, e g  
machine tool applications, use SKF super­ 
precision bearings (SKF catalogue Super- 
precision bearings or available at 
skf com/super­precision) 
Stiffness
The stiffness of a rolling bearing is charac­
terized by the magnitude of the elastic 
deformation in the bearing under load and 
depends not only on bearing type, but also 
on bearing size and operating clearance 
When selecting bearing type on the basis 
of stiffness requirements, you should con­
sider, for bearings with the same size, that:
• stiffness is higher for roller than for ball 
• stiffness is higher for full complement 
bearings than for the corresponding bearing 
with a cage
• stiffness is higher for hybrid bearings than 
for the corresponding all­steel bearing
• stiffness can be enhanced by applying a 
preload (Selecting preload, page 186)

Mounting and 
When selecting bearing type, you should 
consider the mounting and dismounting 
requirements:
• Is it required or beneicial to mount the 
inner and outer ring independently?
 – Select a separable bearing 
• Is it required or beneicial to mount the 
bearing on a tapered seat or with a 
tapered sleeve?
 – Select a bearing with a tapered bore 
 – Consider using SKF ConCentra ball or 
roller bearing units  
(skf com/ball­bearing­units and 
skf com/roller­bearing­units) 
Separable bearings
Separable bearings are easier to mount and 
dismount, particularly if interference its are 
required for both rings 
For separable bearing types, refer to  
 Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial 
applications, page 72 
Bearings with a tapered bore can be mounted 
on a tapered shaft seat or mounted on a 
cylindrical shaft seat using an adapter or 
withdrawal sleeve (ig. 22)  For bearing types 
available with tapered bore, refer to Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial applications, page 72 
Integral sealing
There are two reasons for sealing bearings 
or bearing arrangements:
• keeping the lubricant in the bearing, and 
avoiding pollution of adjacent components
• protecting the bearing from contamina­
tion, and prolonging bearing service life
Capped bearings (sealed bearings or bear­
ings with shields) can provide cost ­effective 
and space­ saving solutions for many appli­
cations  Bearing types, for which integral 
sealing is available, are indicated in Suitability of rolling bearings for industrial applications, page 72 
Cost and availability
Popular items
After determining your required bearing 
type, you may ind it beneicial to select an 
appropriate bearing from our assortment of 
popular items, because they have a high 
level of availability and generally provide  
a cost­effective solution  Popular items  
are marked in the product tables with the 
symbol ‣ 
Large bearings
If a required bearing has an outside diameter 
D ≥ 420 mm, and is not marked as popular, 
then check its availability with SKF.
Capped bearings
Capped (sealed bearings or bearings with 
shields) typically provide more cost-effective 
solutions than using external sealing. In 
addition to providing good sealing performance, these ready-greased bearings do not 
require initial grease ill.
Availability of standard 
housings and sleeves
Using standard housings and sleeves generally leads to more cost-effective bearing 
arrangements. Bearing types for which 
these standard components are available are 
indicated in Suitability of rolling bearings for 
industrial applications, page 72.

The size of a bearing must be suficient to 
ensure that it is strong enough to deliver the 
required/expected life under deined operating 
conditions.
A bearing can be viewed as a system of 
components: raceways, rolling elements, 
cage, seals (if present) and lubricant (ig. 1). 
The performance of each component contributes to or determines the performance 
and life of the bearing (diagram 1). Consider 
these aspects:
• rolling contact fatigue (RCF) on the rolling 
elements and raceways – this is the primary aspect that dictates bearing life in 
most applications
• permanent deformation of rolling elements 
and raceways because of heavy loads acting on the bearing, while it is stationary or 
oscillating slowly, or high peak loads acting 
on the bearing while it is rotating
• cage type or cage material – these may 
limit the operating speed or the permissible
acceleration or temperature1)
• speed limit of contacting seal lips – this 
can determine the maximum allowable 
speed, which affects operating temperature, thereby affecting life
• lubricant life – when the lubricant deteriorates, the resulting poor relubrication 
condition quickly reduces bearing life
The operating conditions of the application 
determine which of these factors most 
 inluence the performance and life of the 
bearing.
This section provides guidance on determining the required bearing size.
The effect of RCF or permanent deformation on rolling elements and raceways is 
directly related to bearing size. Effects of 
cage type and material are not related to 
bearing size. In capped bearings, the effects 
of the lubricant and integral seal are only 
indirectly related to bearing size.
Therefore, the two main criteria that can 
be used for determining appropriate bearing 
size are:
• Size selection based on rating life,
page 88
This is based on the required bearing life, 
taking into account the possible effects of 
rolling contact fatigue, and requires calculation of the basic rating life, L10, or SKF 
rating life, L10m, for the bearing.
• Size selection based on static load,
page 104
This is based on the static load that the 
bearing can accommodate, taking into 
account the possible effects of permanent 
deformation, and requires calculation of 
the static safety factor, s0, for the bearing.
Bearing system life
1) Special cage executions are often available for 
bearing types that are commonly used in applications where such challenging conditions are 
present.
Lbearing = f (Lraceways, Lrolling elements, Lcage, Llubricant, Lseals)


These selection criteria and the related 
bearing ratings and static safety factor are 
shown in diagram 2 and are described in 
detail in the relevant subsections 
Which selection criteria you should use 
depends on the operating conditions of the 
bearing:
• For applications where bearings are run­
ning in typical operating conditions – i e  
normal speeds, good lubrication condi­
tions and not highly or peak loaded – use 
Size selection based on rating life, 
page 88 
• For applications where bearings are run­
ning under very low speeds or which are 
used under stationary conditions, very bad 
lubrication conditions or where occasional 
peak loads occur, use Size selection based 
on static load, page 104 
Note that there are applications where both 
selection criteria must be considered, for 
example where a duty cycle has occasional 
peak loads  Also, in applications where the 
bearing is lightly loaded, the minimum load 
requirement (Requisite minimum load, 
page 106) must also be considered 
After determining bearing size, and before 
going to the next step, check the items listed 
in Checklist after the bearing size is determined, page 106.
Other attributes of the bearing compon­
ents, such as strength and suitability, are 
addressed elsewhere in the Bearing selection 
process, including Lubrication, page 110, 
and Bearing execution, page 182, as well as 
in the product sections  Consider these 
attributes, in addition to bearing size, to 
ensure you obtain best bearing

based on rating

For applications where bearings are running 
in typical operating conditions – i e  normal 
speeds, good lubrication conditions and not 
highly or peak loaded – determine the 
appropriate bearing size based on the 
required bearing life, taking into account the 
possible effects of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) 
This subsection describes the bearing 
rating life equations and the factors that 
must be determined to make the evaluation:
• Bearing rating life – the basis for bearing 
rating life, showing how to calculate basic 
rating life, L10, and SKF rating life, L10m
• Basic dynamic load rating, C, page 91
• Equivalent dynamic bearing load, P, 
page 91
• Life modiication factor, aSKF, page 94
• Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, 
κ, page 102
• Fatigue load limit, Pu, page 104
• Contamination factor, ηc, page 104
Bearing rating life 
For estimating the expected bearing life, you 
can either use basic rating life, L10, or SKF 
rating life, L10m.
If you have experience with the operating 
conditions related to lubrication and contamination, and know that the conditions 
you are working with do not have a dramatic 
effect on the life of your bearings, use the 
basic rating life calculation, otherwise SKF 
recommends using the SKF rating life. 
Bearing life deinition
Bearing life is deined as the number of 
 revolutions (or the number of operating 
hours) at a given speed that the bearing is 
capable of enduring before the irst sign of 
metal fatigue (spalling) occurs on a rolling 
element or the raceway of the inner or outer 
ring.
Tests on seemingly identical bearings, 
under identical operating conditions, result 
in a large variation in the number of cycles, 
or time, needed to cause metal fatigue. 
Therefore, bearing life estimates based on 
rolling contact fatigue (RCF) are insuficiently 
accurate and so a statistical approach is 
needed to determine bearing size. 
The basic rating life, L10, is the fatigue life 
that 90% of a suficiently large group of 
apparently identical bearings, operating 
under identical operating conditions, can be 
expected to attain or exceed. 
To determine a relevant bearing size using 
the deinition given here, compare the calculated rating life against the service life 
expectations of the bearing application, 
using experience from previous dimensioning where available. Otherwise, use the 
guidelines regarding speciication life of various bearing applications provided in 
table 1 and table 2. 
Because of the statistical spread of bearing 
fatigue life, an observed time to failure for an 
individual bearing can be evaluated in relation 
to its rated life, only if the failure probability 
of that particular bearing is determined in 
relation to the general population of bearings running under similar conditions. 
Numerous investigations on bearing failure, in a variety of applications, have conirmed that design guidelines based on 90% 
reliability, and use of dynamic safety factors, 
lead to robust bearing solutions in which 
typical fatigue failures are avoided.

Size selection based on rating life
Basic rating life
If you consider only the load and speed, you 
can use the basic rating life, L10. 
The basic rating life of a bearing in 
accordance with ISO 281 is

SKF rating life
For modern high-quality bearings, the calculated basic rating life can deviate signiicantly 
from the actual service life in a given application. Service life in a particular application 
depends not only on load and bearing size, 
but also on a variety of inluencing factors 
including lubrication, degree of contamination, 
proper mounting and other environmental 
conditions. 
ISO 281 uses a modiied life factor to 
 supplement the basic rating life. The life 
modiication factor aSKF applies the same 
concept of a fatigue load limit Pu (Fatigue 
load limit, Pu, page 104) as used in ISO 281. 
Values of Pu are listed in the product tables. 
Just as in ISO 281, to relect three of the 
important operating conditions, the life 
modiication factor aSKF takes the lubrication 
conditions (Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, κ, page 102), the load level in 
relation to the bearing fatigue load limit, and 
a factor ηc for the contamination level  
(Contamination factor, ηc, page 104) into 
consideration using

Becomes:

Since the life adjustment factor a1 is related 
to fatigue, it is less relevant for load levels P 
below the fatigue load limit Pu. Dimensioning with life adjustment factors relecting 
very high reliability (such as 99%) will result 
in large bearings for given loads. In these 
cases, the bearing load must be checked 
against the minimum load requirement for 
the bearing. Calculating minimum load is 
described in Requisite minimum load, 
page 106.
Commonly used conversion factors for 
bearing life in units other than million revolutions are provided in table 4, page 91.

which is the difference between the requisite

Calculating bearing life with 
variable operating 
conditions, luctuating load
In some applications – for example, industrial 
gearboxes, vehicle transmissions or windmills – the operating conditions, such as the 
magnitude and direction of loads, speeds, 
temperatures and lubrication conditions, are 
continually changing. In these types of applications, bearing life cannot be calculated 
without irst reducing the load spectrum or 
duty cycle of the application to a limited 
number of simpliied load cases (diagram 3). 
For continuously changing loads, each 
different load level can be accumulated and 
the load spectrum reduced to a histogram 
plotting constant-load blocks. Each block 
should characterize a given percentage or 
time-fraction during operation. Heavy and 
normal loads consume bearing life at a 
faster rate than light loads. Therefore, it is 
important to have peak loads well represented in the load diagram, even if the 
occurrence of these loads is relatively rare 
and of relatively short duration.
Within each duty interval, the bearing load 
and operating conditions can be averaged to 
a representative, constant value. The number 
of operating hours or revolutions expected 
from each duty interval, showing the life 
fraction required by that particular load condition, should also be included. Therefore, if 
N1 equals the number of revolutions 
required under the load condition P1, and N 
is the expected number of revolutions for the 
completion of all variable loading cycles, 
then the cycle fraction U1 = N1/N is used by 
the load condition P1, which has a calculated 
life of L10m1. Under variable operating conditions, bearing life can be rated using
10m =  —————————  

      —

=  SKF rating life (at 90%

conditions 1, 2, ... [million

U1, U2, ...

the conditions 1, 2, ...  
U1 + U2 + ... Un = 1
The use of this calculation method is well 
suited for application conditions of varying 
load level and varying speed with known 
time fractions.

Size selection based on rating life
Basic dynamic load 
rating, C 
The basic dynamic load rating C is used for 
calculating basic rating life and SKF rating 
life for bearings that rotate under load. The C 
value is deined as: the bearing load that will 
result in an ISO 281 basic rating life of 
1 000 000 revolutions. It is assumed that the 
load is constant in magnitude and direction 
and is radial for radial bearings and axial, 
centrically acting, for thrust bearings.
The basic dynamic load ratings for SKF 
bearings are determined in accordance with 
the procedures outlined in ISO 281, and 
apply to bearings made of chromium bearing 
steel, heat treated to a minimum hardness of 
58 HRC, operating under normal conditions. 
Dynamic load rating for SKF 
Explorer bearings
SKF Explorer bearings have undergone 
design, material and manufacturing 
improvements that require adjusted factors 
to calculate the dynamic load ratings in 
accordance with ISO 281. The SKF Explorer 
adjusted dynamic load ratings, which are 
higher than the ratings for SKF basic design 
bearings, are veriied by extensive endurance testing.
To fully utilize the improved performance 
of SKF Explorer bearings, the SKF rating life 
calculation including the life modiication 
factor aSKF is recommended. In fact, it is the 
modiied rating life of the bearing, L10m, 
rather than the dynamic load rating, C, that 
provides the most valuable information 
regarding the endurance performance of a 
bearing. For detailed information, refer to 
Life modiication factor, aSKF, page 94. 
Equivalent dynamic 
bearing load, P 
When calculating the bearing rating life, a 
value for equivalent dynamic bearing load is 
required for both basic bearing life and SKF 
bearing life equations.
The loads acting on a bearing are calculated according to the laws of mechanics 
using the external forces – such as forces 
from power transmission, work forces, gravitational or inertial forces – that are known or 
can be calculated.
In real-world circumstances, the loads 
acting on a bearing may not be constant, can 
act both radially and axially, and are subject 
to other factors that require the load calculations to be modiied or, in some cases, 
simpliied.

Calculating equivalent 
The load value, P, used in the bearing rating 
life equations is the equivalent dynamic 
bearing load. The equivalent dynamic bearing 
load is deined as: a hypothetical load, constant in magnitude and direction, that acts 
radially on radial bearings and axially and 
centrically on thrust bearings. 
This hypothetical load, when applied, 
would have the same inluence on bearing 
life as the actual loads to which the bearing 
is subjected (ig. 2). 
If a bearing is loaded with simultaneously 
acting radial load Fr and axial load Fa that are 
constant in magnitude and direction, the 
equivalent dynamic bearing load P can be 
obtained from the general equation.
P = X Fr + Y Fa
P = equivalent dynamic bearing load [kN]
Fr = actual radial bearing load [kN]
Fa = actual axial bearing load [kN]
X = radial load factor for the bearing
Y = axial load factor for the bearing
An axial load only inluences the equivalent 
dynamic load P for a single row radial bearing 
if the ratio Fa/Fr exceeds a certain limiting 
factor e. With double row bearings, even 
light axial loads inluence the equivalent load 
and have to be considered.
The same general equation also applies to 
spherical roller thrust bearings, which can 
accommodate both axial and radial loads.
Certain thrust bearings, such as thrust 
ball bearings and cylindrical and needle 
roller thrust bearings, can only accommodate 
pure axial loads. For these bearings, provided the load acts centrically, the equation 
is simpliied to
P = Fa
Information and data required for calculating 
the equivalent dynamic bearing load for the 
different bearing types is provided in the 
relevant product sections. 
Equivalent mean load
Other loads may vary with time. For these 
situations, an equivalent mean load must be 
calculated. 
Mean load within a duty interval
Within each loading interval, the operating 
conditions can vary slightly from the nominal 
value. Assuming that the operating conditions, 
such as speed and load direction, are fairly 
constant and the magnitude of the load 
 constantly varies between a minimum value 
Fmin and a maximum value Fmax (diagram 4), 
the mean load can be calculated using
Fm = Fmin + 2Fmax

If, as illustrated in diagram 5, the load on the 
bearing consists of a load F1 which is constant

weight of a rotor, and a rotating constant 
load F2 such as an unbalanced load, the 
mean load can be calculated using
Fm = fm (F1 + F2)
Values for the factor fm are provided in 
diagram 6. 
Peak load
High loads acting for short times (diagram 7) 
may not inluence the mean load used in a

loads against the bearing static load rating

Considerations when 
calculating equivalent 
For the sake of simpliication, when calculating 
the load components for bearings supporting 
a shaft, the shaft is considered as a statically 
determined beam resting on rigid, momentfree supports. Elastic deformations in the 
bearing, the housing or the machine frame 
are not considered, nor are the moments 
produced in the bearing as a result of shaft 
delection. These simpliications are necessary 
if you are making bearing arrangement calculations without the aid of relevant computer 
software. The standardized methods for 
 calculating basic load ratings and equivalent 
bearing loads are based on similar 
assumptions. 
It is possible to calculate bearing loads 
based on the theory of elasticity, without 
making the above assumptions, but this 
requires the use of complex computer programs (SKF SimPro Quick and SKF SimPro 
Expert). In these programs, the bearings, 
shaft and housing are considered as resilient 
components of a system.
If external forces and loads – such as inertial forces or loads resulting from the weight 
of a shaft and its components – are not 
known, they can be calculated. However, 
when determining work forces and loads – 
such as rolling forces, moment loads, unbalanced loads and impact loads – it may be 
necessary to rely on estimates based on 
experience with similar machines or bearing 
arrangements. 
Geared transmissions
With geared transmissions, the theoretical 
tooth forces can be calculated from the 
power transmitted and the design characteristics of the gear teeth. However, there 
are additional dynamic forces, produced 
either by the gear, or by the input or output 
shaft. Additional dynamic forces from gears 
can be the result of pitch or form errors of 
the teeth and from unbalanced rotating 
components. Gears produced to a high level 
of accuracy have negligible additional forces. 
For lower precision gears, use the following 
gear load factors:
• pitch and form errors < 0,02 mm:  
1,05 to 1,1
• pitch and form errors 0,02 to 0,1 mm: 
1,1 to 1,3
Additional forces arising from the type and 
mode of operation of the machines that are 
coupled to the transmission can only be 
determined when the operating conditions, 
the inertia of the drive line and the behaviour 
of couplings or other connectors are known. 
Their inluence on the rating lives of the 
bearings is included by using an “operation” 
factor that takes into account the dynamic 
effects of the system. 
Belt drives
When calculating bearing loads for belt driven 
applications, “belt pull” must be taken into 
consideration. Belt pull, which is a circumferential load, depends on the amount of 
torque being transmitted. The belt pull must 
be multiplied by a factor whose value depends 
on the type of belt, belt tension and any 
additional dynamic forces. Belt manufacturers 
usually publish the values. However, should 
information not be available, the following 
can be used:
• toothed belts = 1,1 to 1,3
• V-belts = 1,2 to 2,5
• plain belts = 1,5 to 4,5
The larger values apply:
• where the distance between shafts is 
short
• for heavy or peak load type duty
• where belt tension is high


Life modiication 
factor, aSKF 
The life modiication factor aSKF expands the 
scope of the basic rating life model, L10, 
which depends purely on load and size, by 
taking the following important operational 
factors into account:
• the fatigue load limit in relation to the acting bearing equivalent load (Pu/P)
• the effect of the contamination level in the 
bearing (ηc)
• the lubrication condition (viscosity ratio κ)
This makes the resulting SKF rating life, 
L10m, more encompassing than L10 when 
verifying bearing size selection: 

Lnm = a1 aSKF L10  a1 aSKF

 ——   
qCw
 <Pz
A graph for estimating aSKF is shown in 
diagram 8. The horizontal axis represents 
the combined inluence of load and contamination on fatigue. The viscosity ratio, κ, represents the lubrication conditions and their 
inluence on fatigue.
Use diagram 8 to see how operating conditions affect the basic rating life:
• Area A is dominated by very high load 
and/or severe indentations. 
The lubricating conditions in this 
domain can only marginally improve the 
expected fatigue life, so a potential life 
improvement depends on what dominates 
the relationship between the contamination level and the load level Pu/P. To 
achieve a greater SKF rating life, either the 
load must be reduced, or the cleanliness 
must be improved, or both.
• Area B offers high life modiication factors, 
which is beneicial because a large life 
modiication value will convert a low basic 
rating life suficiently to produce a large 
SKF rating life.
In this part of the graph, small deviations from estimated load level, cleanliness factor and lubrication conditions will 
greatly affect the life modiication factor. 
Small changes to lubricating conditions, 
slightly higher loading and larger indentation severity (for example, from mounting 
or transport damage) may result in a 
change in aSKF from 50 to 5. This would 
result in a 90% loss of SKF rating life. In 
cases where the SKF rating life consists of 
a large life modiication factor aSKF and a 
limited basic rating life L10, the impact of 
variations in operating conditions should 
be evaluated in a sensitivity analysis.
• Area C is where the life modiication factor 
is less sensitive to changes. 
Deviations from estimated load level, 
cleanliness factor and lubrication conditions (for example, from uncertainties in 
temperature) will not substantially affect 
the value of aSKF, which means the resulting SKF rating life is more robust. 
In the load level domain, area C has the 
ranges:
 – Pu ≤ P ≤ 0,5 C for ball bearings
 – Pu ≤ P ≤ 0,33 C for roller bearings
Use the schematic aSKF graph to evaluate 
how changes to operational conditions 
would affect the life modiication factor. This 
can help you check whether a potential beneit is worth the effort. For example, you can 
see how:
• improved cleanliness (better sealing, iltration and assembly conditions) increases 
the contamination factor ηc
• cooling or using a lubricant with higher 
viscosity increases the viscosity ratio κ
• choosing a larger bearing size increases 
the ratio Pu/P (and the basic rating life L10) 
• using SKF Explorer bearings allows a 
more favourable scale on the horizontal 
axis for the combined effect of the ηc times 
Pu/P
The following graphs show plots of the life 
modiication factor aSKF for the four bearing 
types, as a function of ηc(Pu/P), for SKF 
Explorer and SKF basic design bearings, and 
for different values of the viscosity ratio κ: 
• diagram 9, page 96: radial ball bearings
• diagram 10, page 97: radial roller 
• diagram 11, page 98: thrust ball bearings
• diagram 12, page 99: thrust roller 
NOTE
The graphs in diagram 9, 10, 11 and 12 
are plotted for values and safety factors 
typically associated with fatigue load 
limits for other mechanical components. 
Considering the simpliications inherent 
in the SKF rating life equation, even if 
the operating conditions are accurately 
identiied, it is not meaningful to use 
values of aSKF in excess of 50.

■ Low ndm area, where ndm ≤ 10 000 mm/min.  
At these lower ndm values,  AW or EP additives are needed to reduce wear.
■ High ndm area, where ndm ≥ 500 000 mm/min for dm ≤ 200 mm, and 
ndm ≥ 400 000 mm/min for dm > 200 mm.  
At these higher ndm values, operating temperature must be given more attention. 
Certain bearing types, such as spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and 
spherical roller thrust bearings, normally have a higher operating temperature than 
others, such as deep groove ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings, under comparable operating conditions.

Lubrication condition 
– the viscosity ratio, κ
 When a bearing has reached its normal 
speed and operating temperature, the lubrication condition of the bearing is:

κ = —

n1
κ =  lubrication condition of the bearing, i.e. 
viscosity ratio 
ν =  actual operating viscosity of the oil or 
the grease base oil [mm2/s] 
ν1 =  rated viscosity, function of the mean 
bearing diameter and rotational speed 
[mm2/s]
The actual operating viscosity, ν, of the lubricant can be determined from the ISO viscosity grade of the oil, or the grease base oil, 
and the operating temperature of the bearing (diagram 13, page 100) .
You can determine the rated viscosity, ν1, 
from diagram 14, page 101, using the bearing mean diameter dm = 0,5 (d + D) [mm] 
and the rotational speed of the bearing, 
n [r/min]. Alternatively, you can use the SKF 
Bearing Calculator (skf.com/bearingcalculator).
Viscosity grades, in accordance with 
ISO 3448, are listed in table 5, along with 
the viscosity range for each grade at 40 °C 
(105 °F).
The higher the κ value, the better the 
lubrication condition of the bearing and its 
expected rated life. This must be judged 
against the possible friction increase because 
of the higher oil viscosity. Therefore, most bearing applications are designed for a lubrication 
condition ranging from κ 1 to 4 (diagram 15). 
Alternatively, you can use the SKF Bearing 
Calculator (skf.com/bearingcalculator) to 
calculate the lubrication condition.
• κ = 4 indicates a regimen for which the 
rolling contact load is carried by the lubricant ilm – i.e. full ilm lubrication.
• κ > 4 (i.e. better than full ilm lubrication) 
will not further increase the rating of the 
bearing. However, κ > 4 may be useful in 
applications where the bearing temperature rise is small and additional lubrication 
condition reliability is desirable. This would 
apply, for example, to bearing applications 
with frequent start-stop running conditions or occasional temperature variations.
• κ < 0,1 indicates a regimen for which the 
rolling element load is carried by the contact of the asperities between rolling element and raceway – i.e. boundary lubrication. The use of fatigue life rating for 
lubrication conditions below 0,1 is not 
appropriate as it is beyond the applicability 
limits of the life rating model. Where 
κ < 0,1, select the bearing size on the basis 
of static loading criteria by means of the 
static safety factor, s0 (Size selection based
on static load, page 104).
κ value below 1
For lubrication conditions with 0,1 < κ < 1, 
take into account the following:
• If the κ value is low because of very low 
speed, base the bearing size selection on 
the static safety factor s0 (Size selection
based on static load, page 104).
• If the κ value is low because of low viscosity, counteract this by selecting a higher 
viscosity oil or by improving the cooling. 
Under these lubrication conditions, it is not 
appropriate to calculate the basic rating 
life L10 only, because it does not take into 
account the detrimental effects of inadequate lubrication of the bearing. Instead, 
to estimate the rolling contact fatigue life 
of the bearing, use the SKF rating life 
method.
Where κ < 1, EP/AW additives are 
recommended.
The speed factor ndm is used to characterize the speed condition of the bearing.
• If the ndm of the bearing is lower than 
10 000, the application is operating under 
low-speed conditions (diagram 14,
page 101). This regimen requires high oil 
viscosity to ensure that the rolling element 
load is carried by the lubricant ilm.
• High-speed conditions are characterized 
by ndm > 500 000 for dm values up to 
200 mm, and > 400 000 for larger dm
values (diagram 14). At very high speeds, 
the rated viscosity drops to very low values. 
Lubrication conditions and κ values are 
generally high.
EP (extreme pressure) and 
AW (anti-wear) additives
EP/AW additives in the lubricant are used to 
improve the lubrication condition of the 
bearing in situations where small κ values 
are in use. Furthermore, EP/AW additives 
are also used to prevent smearing between 
lightly loaded rollers and raceway, for 
 example, when especially heavy rollers enter 
a loaded zone at a reduced speed.
For operating temperatures lower than 
80 °C (175 °F), EP/AW additives in the lubricant may extend bearing service life when κ 
is lower than 1 and the factor for the contamination level, ηc, is higher than 0,2 and 
the resulting aSKF factor is lower than 3.
Under those conditions, a value of κEP = 1 
can be applied, in place of the actual κ value, 
in the calculation of aSKF for a maximum 
advantage of up to aSKF = 3.
EP/AW additives containing sulphur- 
phosphorus can reduce bearing life. Generally, SKF recommends testing chemical 
reactivity of EP/AW for operating temperatures above 80 °C (175 °F).

Fatigue load limit, Pu 
The fatigue load limit Pu for a bearing is 
deined as the load level below which metal 
fatigue will not occur. For this to be valid, the 
lubricant ilm must fully separate the rolling 
elements from the raceways and no indentations, from contaminants or from damage 
related to handling, may exist on the rolling 
surfaces.
Contamination 
factor, ηc 
The contamination factor, ηc, takes into 
account how the level of solid particle contamination of the lubricant inluences the 
calculated bearing fatigue life. The particles 
cause indentations in the rolling surfaces of 
the bearing, and these indentations increase 
the local contact stress, which reduces the 
expected fatigue life (ig. 3).
• ηc = 1 means perfectly clean conditions 
without any indentations.
• ηc → 0 means severely contaminated conditions resulting in pronounced 
indentations.
In the SKF rating life model, the contamination factor for a certain bearing acts as a 
stress raiser, by reducing the bearing fatigue 
load limit Pu (i.e. multiplying it by the contamination factor ηc).
Comparing the reduced fatigue load limit 
to the actual bearing load, the fatigue resistance value (ηcPu/P) takes both the relative 
bearing load and the local stress ield into 
account (diagram 8, page 95).
• Clean conditions (large contamination 
factor ηc) and a bearing load lower than 
the fatigue load limit results in a high 
resistance to fatigue.
• Contaminated conditions and a bearing 
load larger than the fatigue load limit 
results in a lower resistance to fatigue.
The stress-raising inluence of contamination on bearing fatigue depends on a number of parameters, including: bearing size, 
relative lubricant condition, size and distribution of solid contaminant particles and 
types of contaminants (soft, hard, etc.). 
Therefore, it is not meaningful to specify 
precise values for the contamination factor 
ηc that would have general validity. However, 
guideline values in accordance with 
ISO 281 are listed in table 6.
To simplify calculation of the contamination factor ηc, use the SKF Bearing Calculator 
(skf.com/bearingcalculator).
A more detailed method for estimating the 
contamination factor ηc is described in a 
separate paper (Method for estimating contamination factor, ηc, based on lubricant 
cleanliness, skf.com/go/17000-B3).
Size selection 
based on static 
When any of the following conditions exist, 
bearing size should be selected or veriied 
based on the static load that the bearing can 
accommodate, taking into account the possible effects of permanent deformation:
• The bearing is not rotating and is subjected to continuous high load or intermittent peak loads.
• The bearing makes slow oscillating movements under load.
• The bearing rotates and, in addition to the 
normal fatigue life dimensioning operating 
loads, has to sustain temporary high peak 
loads.
• The bearing rotates under load at low 
speed (n < 10 r/min) and is required to 
have only a limited life. In such a case, the 
rating life equations, for a given equivalent 
load P, would give such a low requisite 
basic dynamic load rating C, that a bearing 
selected on a fatigue life basis would be 
seriously overloaded in service.
In such conditions, the resulting deformation 
can include lattened areas on the rolling 
elements or indentations in the raceways. 
The indentations may be irregularly spaced 
around the raceway, or evenly spaced at 
positions corresponding to the spacing of the 
rolling elements. A stationary or slowly oscillating bearing supporting a load great 
enough to cause permanent deformation 
will generate high levels of vibration and friction when subjected to continuous rotation. 
It is also possible that the internal clearance 
will increase or the character of the housing 
and shaft its may be affected. 
Example of stress ields
Static load rating
The basic static load rating C0 is deined in 
ISO 76 as the load that results in a certain 
value of contact stress at the centre of contact of the most heavily loaded rolling element/raceway. The contact stress values are:
• 4 600 MPa for self-aligning ball bearings
• 4 200 MPa for all other ball bearings
• 4 000 MPa for all roller bearings
These stress values produce a total permanent deformation of the rolling element and 
raceway that is approximately 0,0001 of the 
rolling element diameter. The loads are 
purely radial for radial bearings and axial, 
centrically acting, for thrust bearings.

1) The scale for ηc refers only to typical solid contaminants. Contamination by water or other luids detrimental to bearing life is not included. Because of strong abrasive wear in highly contaminated environments (ηc = 0), the useful life of the bearing can be signiicantly shorter than the rating life.
Loads comprising radial and axial components that are to be evaluated in relation to 
the static load rating C0, must be converted 
into an equivalent static bearing load. This is 
deined as that hypothetical load (radial for a 
radial bearing and axial for a thrust bearing) 
which, when applied, would cause the same 
maximum rolling element load in the bearing as the actual loads to which the bearing 
is subjected. It is obtained from the general 
equation  
P = X0 Fr + Y0 Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
P0 = equivalent static bearing load [kN]
Fr = actual radial bearing load [kN]
Fa = actual axial bearing load [kN]
X0 = radial load factor for the bearing
Y0 = axial load factor for the bearing
Information and data required for calculating 
the equivalent static bearing load P0 is provided in the relevant product sections.
In the equation, use radial and axial component values (ig. 4) for the maximum load 
that can occur. If the load varies then consider the combination that induces the highest value of P0.


Guideline values for 
static safety factor, s0  
The static safety factor s0 is given by
s0 = C0/P0 
s0 = static safety factor
C0 = required basic static load rating [kN]
P0 = equivalent static bearing load [kN]
Alternatively, you can calculate the required 
basic static load rating C0.
Guideline values for the static safety factor 
s0, based on experience, are listed for ball 
bearings in table 7, and roller bearings in 
table 8. The s0 values given for continuous 
motion relate to the inluence of permanent 
deformation on bearing performance – 
ranging from noticeable friction peaks, 
vibrations and reduced fatigue resistance 
(for the lowest s0 values), to no inluence on 
friction, vibration or fatigue life (for the highest s0 values). The certainty of load level 
relects how well the actual bearing load is 
known and/or can be predicted.
Requisite 
minimum load
In applications where the bearing size is 
determined by factors other than load – for 
example, shaft diameter constrained by critical speed – the bearing may be lightly 
loaded in relation to its size and carrying 
capacity. Where there are very light loads, 
failure mechanisms other than fatigue, such 
as skidding and smearing of raceways or 
cage damage, often prevail. To provide satisfactory operation, rolling bearings must 
always be subjected to a given minimum 
load. As a general rule, minimum loads of 
0,01 C should be imposed on ball bearings 
and 0,02 C on roller bearings. More accurate 
minimum load requirements are given in the 
product sections. 
The importance of applying a minimum 
load is greater in applications where there 
are rapid accelerations or rapid starts and 
stops, and where speeds exceed 50% of the 
limiting speeds listed in the product tables 
(Speed limitations, page 135). If minimum 
load requirements cannot be met, potential 
improvements are:
• Use a bearing with a smaller dimension 
series.
• Consider special lubrication or running-in 
procedures.
• Consider NoWear coated bearings, 
page 1060.
• Consider applying a preload (Selecting 
preload, page 186).

SKF life testing 
SKF carries out life testing in the 
ISO 17025 accredited SKF Engineering and 
Research Centre in the Netherlands, 
together with the other SKF group research 
and testing facilities.
The purpose of this life testing is to 
improve the design, the materials and the 
manufacturing processes of bearing products, and the engineering analysis tools 
required for the design of bearing 
applications.
Typical life testing activities include tests 
on bearing population samples under different conditions, such as:
• full ilm lubrication conditions
• boundary and mixed lubrication 
• predeined contamination conditions of 
the lubricant
Apart from testing in different conditions, 
SKF life tests are performed to:
• verify the data published in product 
catalogues
• audit the quality of the manufacturing of 
SKF bearings
• research how lubricants and lubrication 
conditions inluence bearing life
• support the development of rolling contact 
fatigue and friction models
• compare SKF products with competitors’ 
products
Life tests are sophisticated and wide-ranging and are run under strictly controlled conditions. Post-test investigations with stateof-the-art equipment make it possible to 
investigate the factors that affect the life of 
the bearings in a systematic way.
As an example, the SKF Explorer bearing 
design is the result of optimizing inluencing 
factors determined by analytical simulations 
and experimental veriication.

B 4 Lubrication


Rolling bearings must be adequately lubricated to operate reliably. The lubricant is 
required to reduce friction, inhibit wear, protect the bearing surfaces against corrosion 
and may also be needed to provide cooling. 
This section describes: 
• how to select between grease or oil
• how to select a suitable grease
• how to select a suitable oil
For information on lubrication of sealed 
bearings, refer to the relevant product 
sections.
How lubrication relates to other 
selection criteria
Lubrication selection and lubricant properties greatly inluence the operating temperature, which in turn inluences:
• whether you should use grease or oil
• the relubrication interval required for 
grease
• whether oil lubrication is necessary, 
because circulating oil can be used to 
remove heat
• the lubrication condition – the viscosity 
ratio, κ, which inluences the bearing size 
selection based on SKF rating life
Selecting grease 
or oil 
The irst step in the lubrication selection process is to decide whether to use grease or oil. 
In most cases, grease is the appropriate 
choice for open bearings. 
Lubrication selection 
low chart and 
criteria
A low chart to help select the correct lubrication method is shown in diagram 1  
The main reasons to choose grease are:
• cost-effectiveness
• simplicity – grease is easily retained in the 
bearing and housing, thus requiring less 
complicated sealing arrangements compared with those for oil lubrication
The main exceptions to choosing grease are 
in applications where:
• operating conditions require a grease 
relubrication interval that is unacceptably 
short
• lubricating oil must be used for other purposes (such as in gearboxes)
• heat removal via circulating oil is required
• purging or removing used grease becomes 
cumbersome or expensive to handle


Selecting grease or oil
Estimating the 
relubrication interval 
for grease
Lubricating grease slowly degrades and 
therefore has a limited life. Grease life 
depends on the operating conditions of the 
bearing and the grease type. Rolling bearings 
therefore have to be relubricated if: 
• the grease life is shorter than the speciied 
bearing life
• the grease becomes contaminated
It is important to calculate the grease 
 relubrication interval and if it is unacceptably 
short then, unless you use automatic 
 (centralized) greasing (Lubrication systems, 
page 120), you should choose oil instead. 
Relubrication should occur frequently 
enough to avoid grease deterioration having 
an adverse effect on the bearing life. Therefore, the SKF relubrication interval, tf, is 
deined as the time period at the end of 
which there is only a 1% probability that the 
bearing will fail because of grease degradation. This represents the L1 grease life. L10 
grease life represents a 10% probability failure 
because of grease degradation. Grease life 
depends mainly on:
• bearing type and size
• speed
• load ratio C/P
• operating temperature
• grease type
As a rule, standard greases have a practical 
upper temperature limit of 100 °C (210 °F) 
on the ring with the highest temperature. 
Above this temperature, special greases or 
automatic (centralized) greasing systems 
should be used – otherwise, commonly the 
grease life would be too short.

Relubrication intervals
Use diagram 2 to estimate the relubrication 
intervals tf. The diagram is valid for bearings 
with a rotating inner ring on horizontal 
shafts under normal and clean operating 
conditions, using:
• the ndm factor multiplied by the relevant 
bearing factor bf where
 – n = rotational speed [r/min]
 – dm =  bearing mean diameter [mm] 
 – bf  =  bearing factor dependent on bearing 
type and load conditions (table 1)
• the load ratio C/P
The relubrication interval tf is the estimated 
number of operating hours that a good quality 
lithium soap grease with a mineral base oil 
can perform adequately when the operating 
temperature is 70 °C (160 °F)  High performance greases can extend relubrication 
intervals and grease life   
The relubrication intervals given in 
diagram 2 must be adjusted according to 
table 2, page 115  
When the speed factor ndm exceeds 70% 
of the recommended limits (table 1), check 
the inluence of the selected lubricant on the 
operating temperature and speed  
In practice, relubrication intervals above 
30 000 h are not reliable, because intervals 
of that length exceed the predictable performance life (because of lubricant ageing) of 
most greases 
Adjustments for 
relubrication intervals
Various adjustments for relubrication intervals 
are described in table 2 under various 
 operating conditions  You may also calculate 
lubrication intervals using the SKF Bearing 
 Calculator (skf com/bearingcalculator)  
Determining grease 
quantity for initial ill 
and relubrication
Commonly, the free volume in bearings is 
completely illed during installation and the 
free volume in SKF plummer block housings 
is partly illed  SKF recommends that the free 
volume on each side of the bearing in a 
 customer-designed housing is equal to the 
free volume of the bearing  For bearings 
with a metallic cage, the free volume in the 
bearing is approximately
V = —–
π
B (D2 – d2) × 10-3 –  –––––––––
7,8 × 10-3 
V =  free volume in the bearing [cm3]  
(for standard grease, mass in grams multi- 
plied by 0,9; for luorinated grease, mass 
in grams multiplied by approximately 2) 
B =  bearing width [mm] 
D = outside diameter [mm]
d = bore diameter [mm] 
M = bearing mass [kg]

tf [operating hours]
ndm bf [mm/min]


For bearings with non-metallic cages, the 
formula gives a slight overestimation. 
Depending on the intended method of 
relubrication, SKF recommends: 
• relubrication from the side of the bearing 
(ig. 1, page 114)
 – initial ill: 40% of the free volume in the 
housing
 – replenishment quantity: Gp = 0,005 D B
• relubrication through holes in the centre 
of the inner or outer ring (ig. 2, page 114)
 – initial ill: 20% of the free volume in the 
housing
 – replenishment quantity: Gp = 0,002 D B
Gp =  grease quantity to be added when 
replenishing [g]
D =  bearing outside diameter [mm] 
B =  total bearing width [mm]  
(for tapered roller bearings use T, for 
thrust bearings use height H)
During a running-in period, excess grease in 
the bearing distributes or escapes. At the 
end of the running-in period, the operating 
temperature drops, indicating that the 
grease has been distributed. 
In applications where bearings operate at 
very low speeds and good protection against 
contaminants and corrosion is required, SKF 
recommends illing 70% to 100% of the housing with grease.

Selecting grease or oil


Relubrication from the side
Relubrication in the centre
Relubrication 
procedures
Select a relubrication procedure that suits 
the application and the relubrication interval 
tf. SKF recommends one of the following 
procedures: 
• Manual relubrication by replenishment
is a convenient procedure. It enables uninterrupted operation and provides, when 
compared with continuous relubrication, a 
lower steady-state temperature.
• Automatic (centralized) relubrication
avoids performance issues related to 
over- or under-greasing. This is also 
 commonly used where there are multiple 
points to lubricate, or where access to 
positions is dificult, or where equipment is 
operated remotely with no local maintenance staff (diagram 3). 
• Continuous lubrication
is used when the estimated relubrication 
intervals are short because of the adverse 
effects of very severe contamination. 
 Continuous lubrication of applications is 
recommended typically with ndm values 
< 150 000 for ball bearings and < 75 000 
for roller bearings  In these cases, the initial 
grease ill for the housing can be from 70% 
to 100 % (depending on the operation condition and housing seal), and the quantity 
for relubrication per unit of time is derived 
from the equations for Gp (Determining 
grease quantity for initial ill and relubrication, page 112) by spreading the required 
quantity over the relubrication interval 
There must be provision for the used grease 
to be purged from the housing  If an excess 
of used grease needs to be purged from the 
housing, contacting seals must allow for this 
(consider seal type and seal orientation)  
Otherwise, an escape hole should be provided 
in the housing – tubing is not allowed, 
because it can restrict grease escape  The 
escape hole should be plugged during high -
pressure cleaning  
Where a variety of bearing types is used in 
a bearing arrangement, it is common practice 
to apply the shortest estimated relubrication 
interval from the bearings in the

High
There is a clear risk that contaminants will enter

Selecting grease or oil


Selecting a 
suitable grease
Selecting a suitable 
SKF grease
The assortment of SKF greases for rolling 
bearings provides adequate choice for most 
application requirements. These greases 
have been developed based on the latest 
knowledge of rolling bearing lubrication and 
their quality is continuously monitored.
Using LubeSelect and 
selection rules
SKF LubeSelect is an online tool that lists 
SKF greases that fulil the demands of your 
speciied operating conditions. The analysis 
performed by the tool is based on generalized selection rules that have been carefully 
developed by SKF lubrication experts.
The same selection rules are used in the 
SKF bearing grease selection chart, 
page 124, where the speed, temperature 
and load range are used as the primary 
operating parameters for selecting a suitable 
grease. 
The most important technical speciications for SKF greases are provided in Technical speciications for SKF greases, 
page 126.
Temperature, speed, and load 
ranges for grease selection
The terms used to specify the ranges of 
temperature, speed and load, for grease 
lubricated bearings, are deined in table 3 to 
table 5.
Consistency, NLGI
Consistency is a measure of the stiffness of 
the grease. Classiication of greases by consistency is in accordance with the National 
Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI), ISO 2137. 
Greases with a metallic soap thickener and a 
consistency grade of 1, 2 or 3 (soft to stiff) on 
the NLGI scale are typically used for rolling 
bearings. The most commonly used greases 
have a consistency of grade 2.

Mechanical stability
During rotation of a bearing, the grease is 
mechanically worked and a change in consistency may result. This property is known 
as the mechanical stability of the grease and 
is measured in standardized tests, 
ASTM D217 and/or ASTM D1831. Greases 
that soften may leak from the bearing cavity. 
Those that stiffen may restrict bearing rotation or limit oil bleeding. The mechanical 
stability should not change drastically if 
operation is within the speciied temperature 
range of the grease. 
Corrosion protection 
In applications where water or condensation 
is present, the corrosion inhibiting properties 
of the grease are very important. The corrosion inhibiting ability is determined by the 
properties of the rust inhibitor additive and/
or the thickener type. The performance is 
measured using the EMCOR test, ISO 11007. 
For applications where water or condensation is present, the rating should be 0-0. 
The SKF trafic light concept 
for grease temperature 
performance
The temperature range over which a grease 
can be used depends mainly on the type of 
base oil, thickener and additives. The relevant temperature limits are schematically 
illustrated in diagram 4 in the form of a 
double trafic light, with additional details 
provided in diagram 5.
• The low temperature limit (LTL) is determined by the low temperature frictional 
torque test according to ASTM D1478 or 
IP 186. The LTL is determined by the temperature at which the starting torque is 
equal to 1 000 Nmm and the running 
torque is 100 Nmm.
• The high temperature limit (HTL) is the 
temperature at which a grease loses its 
consistency and becomes a luid. It is 
determined using the dropping point 
(ISO 2176).

Selecting a suitable grease


The low and high temperature limits for reliable operation, indicated by the green zone 
in diagram 4, page 117, are:
• low temperature performance limit (LTPL), 
deined as the temperature at which 
grease no longer shows suficient oil bleed 
as measured in DIN 51817  The LTPL 
 values for roller bearings are provided in 
diagram 5, page 117. The LTPL values for 
ball bearings are approximately 20 °C 
(35 °F) lower  
• high temperature performance limit 
(HTPL), determined by the SKF R0F 
grease life test
Within these two limits, the grease fulils its 
function reliably and the relubrication interval 
or grease life is predictable  Because the 
deinition of the temperature performance 
limits is not standardized internationally, 
care must be taken when interpreting data 
from grease suppliers other than SKF 
At temperatures above the high temperature performance limit (HTPL), grease 
degrades with increasing rapidity  Therefore, 
temperatures in the amber zone, between 
the high temperature performance limit 
(HTPL) and the high temperature limit 
(HTL), should only be allowed to occur for 
very short periods  
An amber zone also exists for low temperatures, between the low temperature limit 
(LTL) and the low temperature performance 
limit (LTPL)  In this zone, the temperatures 
are too low to provide suficient oil bleeding  
The width of the amber zone depends on the 
grease type and bearing type  Serious 
 damage can result when the bearings are 
operated continuously below the LTPL  
Short periods in this zone, such as during a 
cold start, are generally not harmful because 
the heat caused by friction brings the bearing 
temperature into the green zone  
Additional factors and 
considerations when 
selecting a grease
Verify the lubrication condition, 
consider EP/AW additives
The lubrication condition, κ, is evaluated by 
using the base oil viscosity as described in 
Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, κ, 
page 102  In the lubrication condition 
domain deined by κ below 1, EP/AW additives are recommended 
EP/AW additives of the sulphur-phosphorus type, which are the most commonly used 
today, may also have a negative inluence on 
the fatigue life of the bearings  This is because 
in the presence of humidity, which can never 
be completely avoided, sulphur and phosphorus acids are produced which induce a 
more aggressive chemical process at the 
rolling contact  This effect increases with 
temperature and, for temperatures above 
80 °C (175 °F), a lubricant with EP/AW additives should only be used after careful testing  
SKF greases have been tested and can be 
used above 80 °C (175 °F) until the HTPL is 
reached 
Low speeds
Bearings that operate at very low to low 
speeds (table 4, page 116) under heavy 
loads should be lubricated with a grease that 
has a high viscosity base oil containing EP 
additives  The thickener should contribute to 
the surface separation  Suficient oil bleeding 
should assure oil replenishment during 
operation  
Solid additives, such as graphite or molybdenum disulide (MoS2), should be considered 
for a speed factor ndm < 20 000 mm/min  
SKF LGEV2 is successfully used up to 
ndm = 80 000  
Heavy and very heavy bearing 
For bearings subjected to a load ratio 
C/P < 4, the calculated relubrication interval 
may be so short that it dictates the use of 
continuous relubrication or oil lubrication  
Miscibility with other greases
If it becomes necessary to change from one 
grease type to another, consider the miscibility of the greases and their ability to be 
mixed without adverse effects (table 6 and 
table 7)  If incompatible greases are mixed, 
the consistency of the grease mix can change 
dramatically such that bearing damage 
because of severe leakage could result  Note 
that PTFE-thickened greases are not compatible with other grease types  
Miscibility with preservation oils
The preservative oils with which SKF bearings are treated are compatible with the 
majority of lubricating greases, with the 
exception of synthetic luorinated oil based 
greases using a PTFE thickener, for example, 
SKF LGET 2 grease  For PTFE-thickened 
greases, the bearing preservatives must be 
removed before applying the grease  White 
spirit is recommended as a solvent  Make 
sure all remnants of solvent have evaporated 
and then immediately apply the grease 
Assessing the 
suitability of nonSKF greases
Greases from suppliers other than SKF must 
be approved by the supplier  Use diagram 6, 
page 120, to evaluate the temperature performance and grease life prediction  Where 
relevant, take into account the considerations 
speciied for SKF greases

Selecting a suitable grease


Viscosity and viscosity index
The required viscosity is primarily given by 
the lubrication condition κ, at the expected 
operating temperature, evaluated as 
described in Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, κ, page 102. The viscosity index, 
VI, is the measure of how the oil viscosity 
changes with temperature. VI is a part of the 
selection process, in particular for applications 
that operate in a large temperature range. 
Oils with a VI of at least 95 are recommended 
Oil type
There are two broad categories of oil types 
– mineral and synthetic – with the following 
types of synthetic oils available:
• polyalphaoleins (PAO)
• esters
• polyglycols (PAG)
Choice of oil type is mainly determined by 
the temperature range in which the application is expected to operate 
• Mineral oils are generally favoured as the 
lubricant for rolling bearings 
• Synthetic oils should be considered for 
operational temperatures above 90 °C 
(195 °F) because of their improved thermal 
and oxidation resistance, or below –40 °C 
(–40 °F) because of their better properties 
at low temperatures 
The pour point of an oil is deined as the 
lowest temperature at which a lubricant will 
low, but it must not be used as a functional 
limit when selecting oil type  If the temperature is above but near the pour point, the 
viscosity is still very high, which may impair 
pumping, iltering, and other characteristics  
The thickness of the hydrodynamic ilm is 
determined, in part, by the viscosity index 
(VI) and the pressure-viscosity coeficient  
For most mineral oil based lubricants, the 
pressure-viscosity coeficient is similar, and 
you can use the generic values obtained 
from literature  However, for synthetic oils, 
the effect on viscosity to increasing pressure 
is determined by the chemical structure of 
its base stock  As a result, there is considerable variation in pressure-viscosity coeficients for different types of synthetic base 
stocks  
Because of the differences in the viscosity 
index and pressure-viscosity coeficient, the 
formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant ilm, 
when using a synthetic oil, may differ from 
that of a mineral oil with the same viscosity  
Regarding the lubrication condition for 
mineral and synthetic oils, the combined 
effect of the viscosity index and the 
 pressure-viscosity coeficient normally 
 cancel each other out  
The properties of the different oil types 
are summarized in table 9. For additional 
information about synthetic oils, contact the 
lubricant supplier  
Oils, and in particular synthetic oils, may 
interact with such things as seals, paint or 
water in a different way than mineral oils, so 
such effects, as well as miscibility, must be 
investigated  
Lubrication systems
Continuous lubrication can be achieved via 
single point or multi point automatic lubricators, e g  SKF’s SYSTEM 24 or SYSTEM 
MultiPoint 
Centralized lubrication systems, such as 
SKF MonoFlex, SKF ProFlex, SKF DuoFlex, 
SKF MultiFlex (table 8) and Lincoln Centro 
Matic, Quicklub and Dual Line can reliably 
deliver grease in a wide range of quantities 
For additional information about  
SKF lubrication systems, refer to 
skf com/lubrication 
Selecting a 
suitable oil
Oil selection criteria
 When you select a lubricating oil, the most 
important parameters are the viscosity and 
viscosity index, the temperature stability 
(which inluences the choice of oil type) and 
the additive package (EP/AW and corrosion 
protection) that its the operating conditions 
for the application

Additives
Lubricating oils usually contain additives of 
various kinds. The most important ones are 
antioxidants, corrosion protection agents, 
anti-foaming additives, and EP/AW additives. In the lubrication condition domain 
deined by κ < 1, EP/AW additives are recommended, but for temperatures above 80 °C 
(175 °F), a lubricant with EP/AW additives 
should only be used after careful testing. 
Oil change interval
The oil change interval depends on the 
operating conditions and the oil type. With 
oil-bath lubrication, it is generally suficient 
to change the oil once a year, provided the 
operating temperature does not exceed 
50 °C (120 °F). Typically, at higher temperatures or with heavy contamination, the oil 
must be changed more often.
With oil circulation, the interval after 
which the oil needs to be changed is determined by an inspection of the oil quality, 
taking into account oxidation and the presence of water and abrasive particles. Oil life 
in circulation systems can be extended by 
removing particles and water from the oil.
Oil change intervals for mineral oils are 
shown in table 10, page 122.

Selecting a suitable oil


Circulating oil without a bath
Circulating oil by means of an external oil 
pump, instead of an oil bath, is mainly used 
when it is needed to remove heat generated 
by the bearing and/or other sources. Oil circulation is also a good lubricating method for 
evacuating solid or liquid contaminants from 
the bearing to ilters and/or oil/liquid separators. The design and layout of the oil drainage must ensure that there is no build-up of 
oil level (Heat low from adjacent parts or 
process, page 131). 
A basic circulating oil system (ig. 7)  
includes:
• oil pump
• ilter
• oil reservoir
• oil cooling and/or heating system
Oil jet
The oil jet lubricating method (ig. 8) is an 
extension of circulating oil systems, and is 
used for bearings operating at very high 
speeds. The dimensioning of oil low and 
corresponding jet size is selected so that the 
oil jet speed reaches at least 15 m/s.
Oil injectors must be positioned so that 
the oil jet penetrates the bearing between 
one of the rings and the cage. To prevent 
churning that can cause increased friction 
and temperature, the design and layout of 
the oil drainage must ensure that there is no 
oil level build-up.
Oil-air
The oil-air lubrication method (ig. 9), also 
called the oil-spot lubrication method, uses 
compressed air to transport small, accurately-metered quantities of oil as small droplets 
along the inside of the feed lines to an injector nozzle, where it is delivered to a bearing. 
This minimum-quantity lubrication method 
enables the bearings to operate at very high 
speeds at a relatively low operating temperature. The compressed air also cools the 
bearing and prevents dust or aggressive 
gases from entering. For additional information, refer to skf.com/super-precision.
Overview of main oil 
lubrication methods
The oil lubrication methods are:
• oil bath without circulating oil
• oil bath with self-circulating oil through 
bearing pumping action
• circulating oil with external pump
• oil jet method
• oil air method
The choice of the oil lubrication method 
depends mainly on:
• the bearing speed
• the need to remove heat
• the need to remove contaminants (solid 
particles or liquid)
SKF offers a wide range of products for oil 
lubrication that are not covered here. For 
additional information about SKF lubrication 
systems and related products, refer to  
skf.com/lubrication. 
Oil bath without circulating oil
The simplest method of oil lubrication is the 
oil bath. The oil, which is picked up by the 
rotating components of the bearing, is distributed within the bearing and then lows 
back to the oil bath in the housing. Ideally, 
the oil level should reach the centre of the 
lowest rolling element (ig. 3) when the 
bearing is stationary. Oil levels higher than 
recommended will increase bearing temperature because of churning (Bearing friction, 
power loss and starting torque, page 132).
Oil bath with self-circulating oil
Oil from a bath is forced to circulate by different methods. Here are some examples:
• Oil is salvaged and directed to the bearings 
by means of drain and ducts (ig. 4). 
• A dedicated component (ring, disc, etc.) 
picks up oil from an oil bath and transports 
it (ig. 5).
• The pumping effect of some bearing types 
can be used to circulate the oil. In ig. 6, 
the spherical thrust roller bearing pumps 
oil which returns to the thrust bearing by 
connecting ducts located under it.
All designs of such lubricating methods 
should be validated individually by tests.

B 5 Operating temperature
and speed


Operating temperature and speed
Bearing operating 
temperature and 
heat low
Temperature has a major inluence on many 
performance characteristics of an application  The heat low to, from and within an 
application determines the temperature of 
its parts 
The operating temperature of a bearing is 
the steady-state temperature it attains when 
running and in thermal equilibrium with its 
surrounding elements  The operating temperature results from (diagram 1):
• the heat generated by the bearing, as a 
result of the combined bearing and seal 
frictional power loss
• the heat from the application transferred 
to the bearing via the shaft, housing, foundation and other elements in its 
surroundings
• the heat dissipated from the bearing via 
the shaft, housing, foundation, lubricant 
cooling system (if used) and other cooling 
devices
The bearing operating temperature depends 
as much on the application design as on the 
bearing generated friction  Therefore, the 
bearing, its adjacent parts and the application should all be thermally analysed  
The relationships between the temperature 
and power loss of components within an 
application is complex and these factors, in 
turn, have interdependencies with many 
others such as bearing sizes, loads and 
lubrication conditions 
They inluence many performance characteristics of an application and its parts, 
and do so in various ways depending on the 
operational state, such as at start-up or in 
normal operation, when steady-state conditions have been reached 
Estimating the operating temperature and 
verifying speed limitations is a critical aspect 
of the analysis of an application 
This section provides details of these primary relationships, and guidance on what to 
consider  
B.5 Operating temperature 
and speed


Thermal equilibrium
Bearing size, 
operating 
temperature and 
lubrication conditions
For a given bearing type, the bearing size, 
operating temperature and lubrication conditions are interdependent as follows 
(diagram 2):

• Bearing size is selected based on bearing 
load, speed and lubrication conditions.
• Operating temperature is a function of the 
bearing load, size, speed and lubrication 
conditions.
• Lubrication conditions depend on the 
operating temperature, the viscosity of the 
lubricant and the speed.
These interdependencies are dealt with by 
taking an iterative approach to the analysis, 
in order to achieve an optimum design for a 
bearing arrangement and select the most 
appropriate components for it.
Thermal 
equilibrium
The operating temperature of a bearing 
reaches a steady state when there is thermal 
equilibrium – i.e. there is a balance between 
generated heat and dissipated heat.
Provided that the load ratio C/P > 10 and 
the speed is below 50% of the limiting speed 
nlim, and there is no pronounced external 
heat input, then cooling via the surrounding 
air and foundation is usually suficient to 
result in an operating temperature well 
below 100 °C (210 °F)  Where these conditions are not met, perform a more detailed 
analysis, as additional heat dissipation may 
be required 
Generated heat
The heat generated is the sum of:
• heat generated by the bearing, as a result 
of the combined bearing and seal frictional 
power loss
• heat low from adjacent parts or processes
Bearing frictional heat (power 
loss)
Bearing friction consists mainly of rolling 
friction, sliding friction, seal friction and oil 
drag losses (Bearing friction, power loss and 
starting torque, page 132)  
Heat low from adjacent parts or 
processes
In many applications, the bearings are in 
locations where they receive:
• heat from working parts of the machine, 
e g  caused by friction in gears or shaft 
seals
• external heat, e g  from hot steam going 
through a hollow shaft
The operating temperature of the bearings 
is inluenced by this, in addition to their 
self-generated heat  Examples of such 
applications include:
• drying cylinders in paper machines
• calender rolls in plastic foil machines
• compressors
• hot gas fans
The heat input from adjacent parts within 
the application or from the process can be 
very pronounced and is typically very dificult 
to estimate  The rule is to insulate the bearing, as far as possible, from the additional 
heat low

starting torque
Bearing friction is not constant and depends 
on certain tribological phenomena that 
occur in the lubricant ilm between the rolling elements, raceways and cages.
Friction changes as a function of speed, in 
a bearing with a given lubricant, are shown 
in diagram 3. Four zones are distinguishable:
• Zone 1 – Boundary lubrication condition, in which only the asperities carry the 
load, and so friction between the moving 
surfaces is high.
• Zone 2 – Mixed lubrication condition, in 
which a separating oil ilm carries part of 
the load, with fewer asperities in contact, 
and so friction decreases.
• Zone 3 – Full ilm lubrication condition, 
in which the lubricant ilm carries the load, 
but with increased viscous losses, and so 
friction increases.
• Zone 4 – Full ilm lubrication with thermal and starvation effects, in which the 
inlet shear heating and kinematic replenishment reduction factors compensate 
partially for the viscous losses, and so friction evens off.
SKF model of bearing 
friction
In the SKF model for calculating bearing 
friction, the total frictional moment, M, is 
derived from four sources: 
M = Mrr + Msl + Mseal + Mdrag 
Mrr =  the rolling frictional moment, and 
includes effects of lubricant starvation and inlet shear heating [Nmm]
Msl =  the sliding frictional moment, and 
includes the effects of the quality of 
lubrication conditions [Nmm]
Mseal =  the frictional moment from integral 
seals [Nmm]  
Where bearings are itted with contact seals, the frictional losses from 
the seals may exceed those generated in the bearing.
Mdrag =  the frictional moment from drag 
losses, churning, splashing, etc., in 
an oil bath [Nmm]
Calculating values for these four sources of 
friction is complex. Therefore, we recommend using the SKF Bearing Calculator 
(skf.com/bearingcalculator).
For detailed information on the calculations, refer to The SKF model for calculating 
the frictional moment 
(skf.com/go/17000-B5).
When the total frictional moment, M, of 
the bearing is known, you can calculate the 
bearing frictional power loss using 
Ploss = 1,05 × 10–4 M n 
Ploss = bearing frictional power loss [W]
= total frictional moment [Nmm]
= rotational speed [r/min]

Estimating bearing operating temperature
Starting torque
The starting torque of a rolling bearing is 
deined as the frictional moment that must 
be overcome by the bearing to start rotating, 
at an ambient temperature of 20 to 30 °C 
(70 to 85 °F)  Therefore, only the sliding frictional moment and the frictional moment of 
seals, if applied, are taken into consideration  
Mstart = Msl + Mseal 
Mstart = starting frictional moment [Nmm]
Msl 
= sliding frictional moment [Nmm]
Mseal = frictional moment of the seals [Nmm]
We recommend using the SKF Bearing 
 Calculator (skf com/bearingcalculator) for 
calculating starting torque values 
Estimating 
bearing operating 
If you are able to estimate a value for the 
heat dissipation from a bearing, Ws, you can  
estimate the operating temperature, Tbear, 
for a bearing in thermal equilibrium, under 
steady-state conditions, using
Tbear = (Ploss / Ws) + Tamb 
Tbear =  estimated average bearing operating 
temperature [°C]
Ploss = bearing frictional power loss [W]
Ws =  total heat dissipation per degree 
above ambient temperature [W/°C]
Tamb = ambient temperature [°C]
Should the value of the estimated bearing 
operating temperature be too high for the 
application requirements – for example, 
resulting in a κ value that is too low, or a 
relubrication interval that is too short – a 
possible solution may be to reduce the operating temperature by means of a circulating 
oil lubrication system  
Estimating heat 
dissipation from SKF 
plummer (pillow) 
blocks
For SKF plummer (pillow) block housings, 
you can use a model based on bearing size 
to estimate heat dissipation values 
Using diagram 4, you can estimate the 
heat dissipation per degree above ambient 
temperature, Ws, for a bearing with bearing 
mean diameter dm in a plummer block housing, with the shaft exposed to the surrounding air 
The estimation is valid for SKF plummer 
block housings used with grease or oil bath 
lubrication and only where there is no significant heat input from external sources, such 
as steam heating of shafts or pronounced 
radiation from hot surfaces

Cooling via 
circulating oil
By circulating the oil, it is possible to cool it, 
and thereby remove heat from the bearing 
In diagram 5, the curved line shows the 
bearing frictional power loss, Ploss, and the 
angled line shows the heat dissipation, Ws 
Taking the heat dissipated via oil circulation into account, the bearing thermal equilibrium under steady-state conditions 
becomes: 
Ploss = Ws (Tbear – Tamb) + Poil 
Ploss  = bearing frictional power loss [W]
Ws =  total heat dissipation per degree 
above ambient temperature [W/°C]
Tbear =  estimated required bearing operating 
temperature [°C]
Tamb = the ambient temperature [°C]
Poil =  estimated power dissipated in the oil 
cooler [W]
Taking the heat dissipation via oil circulation 
into account, you can estimate the bearing 
operating temperature using 
Tbear = ((Ploss – Poil) / Ws) + Tamb
You can estimate the power that must be 
dissipated by oil cooling, for a given bearing 
temperature, using 
Poil = Ploss - Ws (Tbear – Tamb) 
You can estimate the required oil low, for a 
given quantity of power that must be dissipated by oil cooling (Poil), using 
Q = Poil / (27 (Tout – Tin)) 
= required oil low [l/min]
Poil = power dissipated in the oil cooler [W]
Tout =  oil temperature at the housing oil 
 outlet [°C]
Tin =  oil temperature at the housing oil inlet 
[°C]
If you do not have values for Tout or Tin, you 
may assume a temperature difference of 5 to 
10 °C (10 to 20 °F) 
The limit of cooling that is possible via 
circulating oil is determined by the degree of 
heat transfer that can be obtained from a 
given bearing  As a rule of thumb, you can 
determine the maximum oil low, above 
which no signiicant temperature reduction 
is obtained, using 
Qmax = (D B) / 12 500 
Qmax = maximum oil low [l/min]
= bearing outer diameter [mm]
= bearing width [mm]

Speed limitations
Further 
temperature-related 
checks
After you have estimated the operating temperature, check:
• that the temperature assumption for calculating bearing life (operating viscosity) 
was correct
• the lubricant selection and temperature 
• the grease or oil change interval
• the cage and seal material limits
Speed limitations 
The speed capability of a bearing is normally 
determined by the bearing operating temperature  However, for certain bearing types 
and arrangements, the mechanical limits of 
the bearing components may have a signiicant inluence  
The product tables typically provide two 
speed ratings:
• the reference speed, which is based on 
thermal conditions
• the limiting speed, which is based on 
mechanical limits
Both speed ratings are cautionary limits, 
rather than strict prohibiting limits, but 
approaching either of them signals that 
deeper analysis of the operating conditions 
is required 
For bearings with contact seals, no reference speeds are listed in the product tables  
Typically, the limiting speed determines the 
maximum speed for these bearings  
Approximate thermal 
speed limit based on 
ISO standard 
The reference speed listed in the product 
tables is based on the SKF friction model and 
derived from thermal equilibrium under the 
ISO 15312 standardized operating and cooling conditions  Its main purpose is to provide 
a quick assessment of the speed capabilities 
of a bearing  You can also use it to estimate a 
thermal speed limit 
The ISO reference speed is valid for open 
bearings only, operating under the following 
conditions:
• predeined reference heat dissipation
• light loads
 – radial load P = 0,05 C0 for radial 
 – axial load P = 0,02 C0 for thrust bearings
• nominal temperature increase of 50 °C 
(90 °F) above an ambient reference temperature of 20 °C (70 °F)
• oil lubrication with mineral oil without EP 
additives
 – ISO VG32 for radial bearings
 – ISO VG68 for thrust bearings
• clean conditions
• suficient operating clearance (Selecting 
initial internal clearance, page 183)
• horizontal shaft, rotating inner ring and 
stationary outer ring
The ISO standard does not provide reference 
conditions for sealed bearings 
The ISO standard, established for oil lubrication, is also valid for grease lubrication, 
provided a lithium based grease with mineral base oil having a viscosity between 100 
and 200 mm2/s is used  Grease lubricated 
bearings may, however, undergo a temperature peak during initial start-up, requiring a 
running- in period before they reach their 
steady-state operating temperature  
Adjusted reference speed
The ISO reference speed is valid for a standardized set of operating conditions including 
standardized heat dissipation  Therefore, 
SKF recommends calculating the adjusted 
reference speed considering the actual load 
and lubricant viscosity in your application  
Do this using the SKF Bearing Calculator 
(skf com/bearingcalculator)  However, this 
reference speed adjustment does not include 
the data regarding the actual heat dissipation for your application, so a conservative 
approach to the result is recommended  To 
include effects from heat dissipation, a 
detailed thermal analysis is required  
Mechanical speed 
The limiting speed indicated in the product 
tables is a maximum speed valid for the 
standard bearing execution that should not 
be exceeded unless the bearing design and 
the application is adapted to a higher speed 
The limiting speed is determined by:
• the form stability or strength of the cage
• lubrication of the cage guiding surfaces
• centrifugal and gyratory forces acting on 
the rolling elements
• other speed-limiting factors, such as seals 
and the lubricant for sealed bearings
NOTE
Some open ball bearings have very low 
friction, and the reference speeds listed 
for them might be higher than their 
limi ting speeds  Do not use only the 
mechanical speed limit  Also calculate 
the adjusted reference speed  The lower 
of the two sets the speed limit  


Speeds above the 
reference or limiting 
It is possible to operate a bearing at speeds 
above its reference speed, its adjusted reference speed, or even the limiting speed  
Before doing so, irst make a detailed thermal analysis, and take whatever further 
measures may be required, such as use of 
special cage executions, or consider using 
high precision bearings  Regarding management of the effects of increased speed, consider the following options:
• Control the resulting increase in bearing 
temperature by additional cooling 
• Compensate for any reduction in bearing 
clearance resulting from increased bearing temperature 
• Revise the housing itting tolerance choice 
to ensure that the inluence of increased 
bearing temperature does not impair the 
axial displaceability of non-locating bearing outer rings 
• Revise the bearing tolerance class, 
together with the geometrical precision of 
the shaft and housing seats, to ensure 
these are suficient to avoid excessive 
vibration 
• Consider using an alternative cage execution that is suitable for higher speed operation, in particular when approaching or 
exceeding the limiting speed 
• Ensure that the lubricant and lubrication 
method used are compatible with the 
higher operating temperature and the 
cage execution 
• Check that the relubrication interval is still 
acceptable, particularly for grease lubricated bearings  Oil lubrication may be 
required

B 6 Bearing interfaces


The ISO tolerance 
system
Fits for rolling bearings are typically speciied 
with standard tolerance classes for holes and 
shafts as described in ISO 286-2  As bearings are typically manufactured to ISO tolerances (Tolerances, page 36), the selection of 
the tolerance class for the bearing seat 
determines the it  The position and width of 
the tolerance intervals of commonly used 
tolerance classes relative to the bearing bore 
and outside diameter tolerances are illustrated in ig. 1, which is valid for bearings 
with Normal tolerances and of medium size  
It is important to note that the ISO tolerance 
classes for rolling bearings and for holes and 
shafts are different  The tolerances for each 
size vary over the full range of actual sizes  
You should therefore select the respective 
tolerance classes for bearing seats based on 
the actual bearing size for your application 
Bearing seats on shafts and in housings, and 
components which locate a bearing axially, 
have a signiicant impact on bearing performance  To fully exploit the load carrying ability of a bearing, its rings or washers should 
be fully supported around their complete 
circumference and across the entire width of 
the raceway  Bearing seats should be manufactured to adequate geometrical and 
dimensional tolerances and be uninterrupted by grooves, holes or other features 
In this section you can ind recommendations and requirements for designing bearing interfaces, including:
• criteria when selecting bearing its
• recommended its for standard conditions
• tables to help determine minimum, maximum and probable values of clearance or 
interference between the bearing and its 
seat
• recommendations for specifying geometrical tolerances of bearing seats
• recommendations for the axial support of 
bearing rings
• further design considerations for bearing 
interfaces
Selecting its
Fits can be selected by following the recommendations for bearing seat diameter tolerances (Seat tolerances for standard conditions, page 148)  These recommendations 
will provide adequate solutions for the 
majority of applications  However, they do 
not cover all details of a speciic application 
and so you may ind that adjustments may 
be necessary  When selecting its, you should 
consider the following topics

Conditions of rotation
Conditions of rotation refer to the relative 
motion between a bearing ring and the load 
acting upon it (table 1)  Essentially, there are 
three different conditions:
• Rotating loads
These loads occur where either the bearing ring or the applied load is stationary 
while the other rotates  A bearing ring 
mounted with a loose it will creep on its 
seat when subjected to a rotating load, 
and this can lead to fretting corrosion and 
eventually wear  To prevent this from happening, an adequate interference it, 
between the ring subjected to rotating 
load and its seat, is required  For the purpose of selecting its, loads that oscillate 
(such as loads acting on connecting rod 
bearings) are considered to be rotating 
• Stationary loads
These loads occur where both the bearing 
ring and the applied load are stationary or 
both are rotating at the same speed  
Under these conditions, a bearing ring 
normally does not creep and there is no 
risk of fretting corrosion or wear  In this 
case, the ring does not need to have an 
interference it  
• Direction of load indeterminate
This refers to variable or alternating external loads, sudden load peaks, vibration or 
unbalanced loads in high-speed applications  These give rise to changes in the 
direction of load, which cannot be accurately described  Where the direction of 
load is indeterminate and particularly 
where heavy loads are involved, there is a 
risk of fretting corrosion or wear  You 
should use an interference it for both 
rings  The same it as for a rotating load is 
normally suitable  Where the outer ring 
should be able to move axially in its housing, a loose it must be used  However, a 
loose it can result in housing wear  Where 
this cannot be tolerated, either protect the 
bearing seat surface or select a bearing 
that accommodates the axial displacement 
within itself (cylindrical roller, needle roller 
or CARB bearing)  These bearings can be 
mounted with an interference it for both

Selecting its
Magnitude of load
The ring of a bearing deforms proportionately to the load  For rotating inner ring 
loads, this deformation can loosen the interference it between the inner ring and shaft, 
causing the ring to creep on its shaft seat  
The heavier the load, the tighter the interference it required  The required interference can be estimated using: 

= 2,5  

Fr B
PJKK
∆
Δ = required interference [µm]
d = bearing bore diameter [mm]
B = bearing width [mm]
Fr = radial load [kN]
Where sudden load peaks or vibration 
occurs, a tighter it can be required 
differences
In operation, bearing rings normally reach a 
temperature that is higher than that of the 
components to which they are itted  This 
can loosen the it on the shaft seat, while 
outer ring expansion can prevent the desired 
axial displacement in the housing 
Rapid start-up can loosen the inner ring 
it when the frictional heat generated by the 
bearing is not dissipated quickly enough  In 
some cases, friction from seals can generate 
enough heat to loosen the inner ring it 
External heat and the direction of heat 
low can have an effect on its  Steady-state 
and transient conditions must be considered  
For additional information about temperature differences, refer to Selecting internal 
clearance or preload, page 182 
Precision 
requirements
To minimize delections and vibration in precision or high-speed applications, interference or transition its are recommended  
Design and material 
of the shaft and 
housing
Distortion of the bearing rings caused by 
shaft or housing design, for example by discontinuities of the seat or uneven wall thickness, should be avoided 
For split housings, SKF generally recommends loose its  The tighter (less loose) the 
it is in a split housing, the higher are the 
requirements for the geometrical tolerances 
of the seat  Split housings machined to tight 
tolerances, such as SKF plummer block 
housings, can be used for transition its up to 
K7 
Bearings mounted in thin -walled housings or on hollow shafts require tighter 
interference its than those recommended 
for robust cast iron housings or solid shafts 
(Tolerances for seats on hollow shafts, 
page 146) 
Shafts or housings made of materials 
other than steel or cast iron may require 
different its depending on material strength 
and thermal properties 
Ease of mounting 
and dismounting
Loose its are beneicial for easy mounting 
and dismounting  In applications where 
interference its are required for both the 
shaft and housing seat, separable bearings 
or bearings with a tapered bore should be 
considered  Bearings with a tapered bore 
can be mounted on tapered sleeves (ig. 2) 
or on a tapered shaft seat (ig. 3) 
Axial displacement of 
the bearing in the 
non-locating position
When a non- locating bearing needs to be 
able to move axially on its seat, the ring subjected to the stationary load should have a 
loose it  For additional information about 
bearings in the non-locating position, refer 
to Arrangements and their bearing 
types, page 70

plain shaft with an adapter sleeve

Tolerances for 
bearing seats and 
abutments
Dimensional tolerances for bearing seats are 
dictated by the required it  Precision 
requirements of the application will direct 
you to which bearing tolerance class to use 
(Bearing execution, page 182) and, consequently, what run-out tolerance of the seat 
is needed  The run-out of the seat is speciied by the total radial run-out of the seat 
surface and the total axial run-out of the 
abutment (ISO 1101, 18 16) 
For bearings with Normal tolerances in 
general industrial applications, seats are 
typically machined to the following 
tolerances:
• shaft seats to grade IT6 dimensional tolerances and grade IT5 total run-out 
tolerances
• housing seats to grade IT7 dimensional 
tolerances and grade IT6 total run-out 
tolerances
Suitable combinations of tolerance grades 
are listed in table 2  The tolerance zone for 
the total radial run-out is limited to half of 
the ISO tolerance grade, because the runout tolerance is speciied as a difference in 
radii of two coaxial cylinders, and the ISO 
tolerance grade refers to the diameter 
For seats of bearings mounted on withdrawal or adapter sleeves, wider diameter 
tolerances are permissible  The total run-out 
tolerances should be the same as for bearings on cylindrical seats 
Tolerance values for ISO tolerance grades 
are listed in table 3

Tolerances for seats 
on hollow shafts
When a bearing is mounted on a hollow 
shaft using an interference it, the shaft 
experiences more elastic deformation than a 
solid shaft. As a result, the effectiveness of 
the it is less than for the same size solid 
shaft. The effectiveness of an interference it 
on a hollow shaft depends on certain diameter ratios (ig. 5):
• the diameter ratio of the hollow shaft 
ci = di / d
For diameter ratios ci ≤ 0,5 the reduc­
tion of effectiveness is negligible.
• the diameter ratio of the bearing inner 
ring ce = d / de
When the average outside diameter of 
the inner ring de is not known, the diam­
eter ratio can be estimated from 

ce = J J J
J J
 k (D – d) + d
ce =  diameter ratio of the bearing inner 
d = bearing bore diameter [mm]
D = bearing outside diameter [mm]
k = adjustment factor 
=  0,25 for self­aligning ball bearings in 
the 22 and 23 series 
= 0,25 for cylindrical roller bearings
= 0,3 for other bearings
For shaft diameter ratios ci > 0,5 the diam­
eter tolerance determined for a seat on a 
solid shaft should be adjusted to achieve the 
same effectiveness of the it on the hollow 
shaft. This can be done with the following 
procedure. 
1 Determine the mean probable interfer­
ence for the tolerance selected for a seat 
on a solid shaft, ΔS (Tolerances and resultant its, page 153).
2 Determine the required increase of inter­
ference for the seat on the hollow shaft 
from diagram 1, based on the diameter 
ratios ci and ce.
3 Calculate the required mean probable 
interference for the seat on the hollow 
shaft and select the tolerance class 
accordingly.
Example
A 6208 deep groove ball bearing with 
d = 40 mm and D = 80 mm is to be mounted 
on a hollow shaft with a diameter ratio 
ci = 0,8. What is the appropriate tolerance 
class for the shaft seat?
The bearing is subjected to normal loads, 
and a tolerance class k5 is appropriate for a 
seat on a solid shaft.
• The diameter ratio of the bearing inner 
ring is

ce = 
J J J J
J J J
  = 0,77
   0,3 (80 – 40) + 40
• The mean probable interference on a solid 
shaft is
ΔS = (22 + 5) / 2 = 13,5 μm (table 14,
page 160, k5 for a 40 mm shaft diameter)
• The increase in interference for the seat 
on the hollow shaft is
ΔH / ΔS = 1,7 (diagram 1, ci = 0,8 and 
ce = 0,77)
• The requisite interference for the seat on 
the hollow shaft is
ΔH = 1,7 × 13,5 = 23 μm
• The appropriate tolerance class for the 
seat on the hollow shaft is m6 (table 14,
mean probable interference, 
(33 + 13) / 2 = 23 μm)

Tolerances for 
tapered seats
For tapered shaft seats, SKF recommends 
the following tolerances (ig. 6): 
• The permissible deviation for the rate of 
the taper is a ± tolerance in accordance 
with IT7/2  The bearing width B is the 
nominal size, which determines the stand­
ard tolerance values  The permissible 
deviation for the rate of the taper can be 
determined using

 IT7/2
∆k = 
 

The permissible range of dispersion of the 
rate of the taper can be determined using

 IT7/2
Vk = 1/k ± 
 

Δk =  the permissible deviation of the rate 
of the taper
Vk =  the permissible range of dispersion 
of the rate of the taper
B = bearing width [mm] 
IT7 =  the value of the tolerance grade, 
based on the bearing width [mm]
= factor for the taper
= 12 for taper 1:12
= 30 for taper 1:30
• To determine the permissible dispersion of 
the taper angle α, use
α = 2atan (Vk/2)
• The roundness tolerance is deined as 
“distance t between two concentric circles 
in each radial plane perpendicular to the 
cone axis along the tapered surface of the 
shaft”. t is the value of tolerance grade 
IT5/2, based on the diameter d. Where a 
high degree of precision is required, IT4/2 
should be used instead.
• The straightness is deined as “In each 
axial plane through the tapered shaft, the 
tolerance zone is limited by two parallel 
lines a distance t apart”. t is the value of 
tolerance grade IT5/2, based on the diam­
eter d.
Taper position
Only dimensional and geometrical toler­
ances of the taper are indicated in ig. 6. The 
axial position of the taper requires additional 
speciications. When specifying the axial 
position, you should also take into account 
the axial drive­up distance of the bearing, 
which is required to achieve a suitable inter­
ference it. 
Checking tolerances
To check whether a tapered shaft seat is 
within its tolerances, SKF recommends 
measuring it with a special taper gauge, 
Ra 1,6
1/k ± (IT7/2) / B
d js9 E
Tolerances for tapered shaft seats
based on saddles and gauging pins. More 
practical, but less accurate measurement 
methods include ring gauges, taper gauges 
and sine bars. For information about SKF 
measuring devices, refer to skf.com (GRA 30 
ring gauges and DMB taper gauges).
Surface texture of 
bearing seats
The surface texture of a bearing seat has 
less of an impact on bearing performance 
compared to the dimensional and geomet­
rical tolerances of the seat. However, the 
texture of the mating surfaces affects 
smoothing, which can reduce the interfer­
ence in a it. The surface texture should be 
limited to ensure the required it is obtained. 
Guideline values for the roughness proile 
parameter Ra are listed in table 4. These 
recommendations apply to ground seats, 
which are normally assumed for shaft seats. 
For housing seats, which are normally ine­
turned, the Ra values may be one class 
higher. For applications where some loss of 
interference is not critical, rougher surfaces 
than recommended in table 4 can be used.

Seat tolerances 
for standard 
The following tables provide recommendations for tolerances of shaft and housing 
seats  They are valid for standard applications but do not cover all details of a speciic 
application. The information under 
Selecting its, page 140, and Tolerances for 
bearing seats and abutments, page 144, 
should be additionally considered. 
These recommendations are valid for 
bearings with Normal dimensional tolerances. They can also be used for bearings to 
P6 dimensional tolerances. The tighter P6 
tolerance zone changes the resulting it only 
slightly.
Recommended seat tolerances for metric 
bearings:
• For solid steel shafts:
 – Radial ball bearings (table 5, except 
insert bearings)
 – Radial roller bearings (table 6, except 
needle roller bearings)
 – Thrust ball bearings and spherical roller 
thrust bearings (table 7, page 150)
• For cast iron and steel housings:
 – Radial bearings (table 8, page 151)
 – Thrust bearings (table 9, page 152)
For the following bearing types, recommendations are listed in the product sections: 
• Insert bearings, Design considerations,
page 356
• Needle roller bearings, relevant sections 
under Needle roller bearings, page 903
• Cylindrical roller thrust bearings, Design
considerations, page 885

Tolerances and 
resultant ﬁts 
The tables in this section provide information about bearing tolerances, seat tolerances and resultant its (ig. 7). These should 
enable you to determine easily the maximum and minimum values of its when 
using ISO tolerance classes for bearing seats 
and bearings with Normal tolerances for the 
bore and outside diameter. The SKF Bearing 
Calculator (skf.com/bearingcalculator) provides a similar function for every individual 
bearing.
The tables cannot be used for tapered 
roller bearings when d ≤ 30 mm or 
D ≤ 150 mm or for thrust bearings when 
D ≤ 150 mm. The diameter tolerances for 
these bearings deviate from the Normal tol­
erances for other rolling bearings.
The tables list:
• the upper and lower limits of bore or out­
side diameter deviations for bearings with 
Normal tolerances
• the upper and lower limits of shaft or 
housing bore diameter deviations for rele­
vant tolerance classes in accordance with 
ISO 286 2
• the smallest and largest values of the the­
oretical interference (–) or clearance (+)
• the smallest and largest values of the ±3σ 
probable interference (–) or clearance (+)
The appropriate values for shaft seats are 
listed for the following tolerance classes:
• f5, f6, g5, g6, h5 (table 11, page 154)
• h6, h8, h9, j5, j6 (table 12, page 156)

Provisions for 
mounting and 
Particularly when large bearings are 
involved, SKF recommends that during the 
design stage you make provisions to facilitate mounting and dismounting, including:
• slots or recesses machined in the shaft or 
housing shoulders so that withdrawal 
tools can be used (ig. 8)
• threaded holes in the housing shoulders 
so that bolts can be used for dismounting 
(ig. 9)
• oil supply ducts and distribution grooves in 
the shaft to enable the oil injection method 
to be used (ig. 10)
Recommended dimensions for oil supply ducts and distribution grooves are 
listed in table 22, and for threaded holes 
in table 23  When using the oil injection 
method, Ra should not exceed 1,6 μm 
Slots or recesses in the shaft to apply 
withdrawal tools

Axial location of 
bearing rings
Typically, it is not suficient to use an interference it alone to axially locate a bearing 
ring on a cylindrical seat  Common ways of 
locating bearing rings axially include:
• shaft or housing shoulders
• lock nuts or threaded rings (ig. 11 and
ig. 12)
• end plates or housing covers (ig. 13 and
ig. 14)
• distance rings, which support against 
adjacent parts (ig. 15)
• snap rings (ig. 16)
Any axial location should be able to accommodate the axial loads that may be applied 
to the bearing 
Outer ring supported by a threaded ring
Inner ring supported by an end plate and 
shaft shoulder
Inner ring supported by a distance ring 
and lock nut
Inner ring supported by a lock nut and 
shaft shoulder
Bearing supported axially by snap rings 
and shaft shoulder 
Outer ring supported by housing cover 
and housing shoulder
Bearings with a 
Depending on conditions and requirements, 
common ways of axially locating the inner 
ring of a bearing with a tapered bore are:
• a lock nut for bearings mounted on a 
tapered seat (ig. 17)
• an adapter sleeve only (ig. 18), if no precise axial positioning is required and the 
axial loads do not exceed the friction 
between sleeve and shaft
• an adapter sleeve and a distance ring 
(ig. 19), if precise axial positioning is 
required or elevated axial loads occur
• a withdrawal sleeve with a distance ring 
(or shaft shoulder) and lock nut (ig. 20)
Abutments and illets
When designing abutments, allow enough 
space to avoid contact between rotating and 
stationary parts 
Shaft and housing illet dimensions should 
always be smaller than the bearing chamfer 
radii  Heavily loaded shafts can require large 
illets and a spacing collar may be necessary 
(ig. 21) 
Appropriate abutment and illet dimensions are listed in the product tables 


Provisions for mounting and dismounting
Radially free 
mounted bearings 
for axial load 
You may want to use individual bearings in a 
bearing arrangement to separately accommodate the radial and axial component of 
the load  A typical arrangement is to use a 
cylindrical roller bearing and a four-point 
contact ball bearing (ig. 22) 
When using an individual bearing to 
accommodate the axial load, you should 
ensure that this bearing is not subjected to 
unintended radial loads by:
• designing the bore diameter of its housing 
to be approximately 1 mm larger than the 
bearing outer diameter
• not clamping its outer ring in the axial 
direction to permit its free radial positioning
Also consider the use of an anti-rotation pin

bearing has two locating slots in the outer

In order to save space, the rolling elements 
of cylindrical, needle or tapered roller bearings can run directly on raceways on the 
shaft and/or in the housing  To fully exploit 
the load carrying capacity, the raceways 
should comply with certain requirements, 
including:
• suitable material properties such as 
cleanliness, hardness and heat treatment
• suitable roughness and surface texture
• adequate tolerances for proile, roundness 
and total run-out

Selecting internal clearance
Selecting internal 
clearance or 
Bearing internal clearance (ig. 1) is deined 
as the total distance through which one 
bearing ring can be moved relative to the 
other in the radial direction (radial internal 
clearance) or in the axial direction (axial 
internal clearance) 
Initial internal clearance is the internal 
clearance in the bearing prior to mounting  
Mounted clearance is the internal clearance in the bearing after mounting but prior 
to operation  
Operating clearance is the internal clearance in the bearing when it is in operation 
and has reached a stable temperature 
In most applications, the initial internal 
clearance in a bearing is greater than its 
operating clearance  This is because of the 
effects of (ig. 2):
• interference its with the shaft and/or 
housing
• thermal expansion of the bearing rings 
and associated components
Bearings must have the appropriate operating clearance to operate satisfactorily 
(Importance of selecting correct clearance/
preload) 
In most cases, bearings require a certain 
degree of clearance (Selecting initial internal 
clearance)  However, in some cases, they 
may require preload (i e  negative clearance, 
refer to Selecting preload, page 186) 
As a general rule:
• Ball bearings should have an operating 
clearance that is virtually zero 
• Cylindrical, needle, spherical and CARB 
toroidal roller bearings typically require at 
least a small operational clearance 
• Tapered roller and angular contact ball 
bearings should have a small operational 
clearance, except in applications where a 
high degree of stiffness or positional control is required, in which case they can be 
mounted with a degree of preload 
Sections Selecting initial internal clearance 
and Selecting preload, describe the inluencing factors that you must consider and provide the methods by which you can calculate 
the initial internal clearance needed to 
achieve the degree of operational clearance/
preload required by your application 
Bearing internal clearance
As part of the bearing selection process, 
when the bearing type, size, and it have 
been determined, additional factors must be 
considered to enable you to further deine 
the inal variant of the bearing 
In this section you can ind recommendations and requirements for selecting:
• the bearing internal clearance or preload
• the bearing tolerances
• the appropriate cage (where applicable)
• integral seals (where applicable)
• additional options, such as coatings and 
other features to meet any special needs/
requirements

Selecting internal clearance or preload
Importance of 
selecting correct 
clearance/preload
The operating clearance or preload in a 
bearing inluences, among other things, the 
friction, load zone size and fatigue life of a 
bearing  The relationship between these 
parameters is shown in diagram 1  The diagram is generalized and based on rolling 
bearings under radial load 
For general applications, the operating 
clearance range should be within the recommended zone shown in diagram 1 
Selecting initial 
internal clearance
The operating clearance required for a bearing to perform satisfactorily is application 
dependent (Importance of selecting correct 
clearance/preload).
You must ensure that the bearing has a 
minimum initial internal clearance of a size 
that, when it is reduced by the effects of 
mounting and other inluences, is equal to or 
greater than the required minimum operating clearance 
To achieve this, follow this procedure:
• consider the reduction of clearance caused 
by interference its (page 184)
• consider the reduction of clearance caused 
by temperature difference between the 
shaft, bearing rings and housing 
(page 184)
• consider the reduction of clearance caused 
by other inluences (page 185)
• consider the required minimum initial 
internal clearance (page 185)
Initial internal clearance and operating clearance
• select the required minimum initial in ternal 
clearance (page 185)

Range of initial internal 
Bearing types for adjusted bearing arrangements – such as angular contact ball bearings, tapered roller bearings and spherical 
roller thrust bearings – have their internal 
clearance set during mounting  The internal 
clearance of such an arrangement, even 
though set by adjustment during mounting, 
will nevertheless have a range 
For other bearing types, the initial internal 
clearance is determined during their manufacture. ISO has deined ive clearance 
classes for specifying the degree of initial 
internal clearance in a bearing (Internal 
clearance, page 26). Each clearance class 
represents a range of values. The size of the 
ranges varies depending on bearing type 
and size. Clearance class details are listed in 
relevant product sections.
Initial clearances greater than Normal, 
such as C3 or even C4 clearance classes, are 
very common today. This is because modern 
bearings take higher loads and require 
tighter interference its, and typical operating conditions are different, compared to 
when the clearance classes were deined.
For universally matchable single row 
angular contact ball bearings and matched 
tapered roller bearings, double row angular 
contact ball bearings and four-point contact 
ball bearings, values for the axial internal 
clearance are given instead of radial internal 
clearance, because the axial clearance is of 
greater practical importance for these bearing types. Radial internal clearance is related 
to axial internal clearance and that relationship is determined by the bearing type and 
its internal geometry. For detailed information, refer to the product sections.
Clearance reduction caused 
by interference its
An interference it causes clearance reduction because inner rings are expanded and 
outer rings are compressed. The reduction 
equals the effective interference it multiplied by a reduction factor using
Δrit = Δ1 f1 + Δ2 f2
Δrit =  clearance reduction caused by the it 
[μm] 
f1 
= reduction factor for the inner ring
f2 
= reduction factor for the outer ring
Δ1 =  effective interference between the 
inner ring and shaft [μm]
Δ2 =  effective interference between the 
outer ring and housing [μm]
Reduction factors valid for a solid steel shaft 
and a thick-walled cast iron or steel housing 
can be obtained from diagram 2 as a function of the ratio of the bearing bore diameter 
d to the outside diameter D. For the effective 
interference value, use the maximum probable interference value listed in the appropriate tables in Tolerances and resultant its, 
page 153.
For a more detailed analysis, consider 
using SKF calculation tools, such as SKF 
Bearing Calculator (skf.com/bearingcalculator), 
SKF SimPro Quick or SKF SimPro Expert, or 
contact the SKF application engineering 
service.
Clearance reduction caused 
by temperature difference 
between shaft, bearing rings 
and housing
The temperature behaviour of an application 
can create a difference in temperature 
between a bearing inner ring and outer ring, 
which changes the mounted bearing clearance/preload. For a steel shaft and steel or 
cast iron housing, the change can be estimated using
Δrtemp = 0,012 ΔT dm
Δrtemp =  clearance reduction caused by 
temperature difference [μm] 
ΔT 
=  temperature difference between 
inner and outer ring [°C]
dm 
=  the bearing mean diameter [mm] 
= (d + D)/2
Steady state
The operating temperature of a bearing 
reaches a steady state when there is thermal 
equilibrium (page 131) – i.e. there is a balance between generated heat and dissipated 
heat. In the common case where the ambient temperature of the surroundings of the 
housing of a bearing arrangement is cooler 
than its shaft, a steady-state temperature 
gradient is developed that results in the 
inner ring of the bearing being hotter than 
the outer ring (ΔTsteady in diagram 3).

Selecting internal clearance or preload
Start-up
During start-up, the temperature gradient 
over the bearing is largely determined by the 
transient heat low  Among the various components in contact with the bearing, the one 
that has the smallest thermal capacity will 
rise in temperature faster than the one that 
has the largest thermal capacity  Therefore, 
the start-up sequence can result in a larger 
temperature differential between bearing 
inner and outer ring than in the steady-state 
condition  It results in a temperature peak 
during start-up (ΔTmax in diagram 3)  This is 
especially pronounced in machines that 
either are working outdoors in a cold climate 
or have a heated shaft 
Higher speeds
Whether during start-up or at steady state, 
higher speeds generate larger frictional 
losses  This typically results in a larger temperature differential between the bearing 
inner and outer ring and therefore a need for 
larger initial clearance 
Other inluences on 
clearance/preload
Axial clamping of a ring results in a small 
increase of its diameter  Normally, this has a 
negligible inluence  For machines where 
there is a large axial load on any of the rings, 
or where two bearings (e g  angular contact 
ball bearings or tapered roller bearings, with 
or without distance rings) are clamped axially, the inluence on clearance or preload 
from the axial compression and the radial 
expansion must be considered 
Misalignment beyond the limits speciied 
in the product sections will reduce the clearance which, because of unfavourable load 
distribution, will result in reduced service life 
and increased friction 
Where light alloy materials are used, the 
temperature differences between rings and 
shaft or housing may have a more pronounced inluence on the clearance of the 
Required minimum initial 
internal clearance
The required minimum initial internal clearance can be estimated using
r = rop + Δrit + Δrtemp + Δrother 
=  required minimum initial internal 
clearance [μm]
rop 
= required operating clearance [μm]
Δrit 
=  clearance change caused by the 
maximum expected its [μm]
Δrtemp =  maximum clearance change 
expected from the temperature 
difference during start-up or in 
steady state [μm]
Δrother =  maximum clearance change 
expected from other effects such as 
axial clamping [μm]
• Bearing types for adjusted bearing 
arrangements – such as angular contact 
ball bearings, tapered roller bearings or 
spherical roller thrust bearings – have 
their internal clearance set during mounting (Mounting adjusted bearing arrangements, page 203) 
• For other bearing types, select a bearing 
clearance class (Internal clearance, 
page 26: Normal, C3, C4, etc ) whose 
minimum clearance is equal to or greater 
than the estimated minimum initial internal clearance (ig.3)  Then verify whether 
the resulting maximum clearance of the 
selected clearance class is acceptable for 
the application  If the maximum clearance, 
for whatever reason, is too large then consider choosing a reduced clearance group 
– e g  C3L, which includes only the lower 
half of the C3 clearance group range 
The minimum clearance of the bearing clearance class must be equal to or greater than the estimated minimum initial internal

Selecting preload
Depending on the application, there may be 
a need to preload a bearing arrangement  
For example, if a high degree of stiffness or 
positional control is required then preload 
may be suitable  Similarly, where there is a 
very light or no external load on the bearing 
in operation then preload may be required to 
ensure a minimum load 
Applying the preload is typically done by 
measuring a force, sometimes a displacement over a distance or path, or by measuring the frictional torque during mounting 
Empirical preload values can be obtained 
from proven designs and can be applied to 
similar designs  For new designs, SKF recommends calculating the appropriate 
preload range by using SKF SimPro Quick or 
SKF SimPro Expert and then checking it by 
testing in the application  The agreement 
between the calculation and the actual 
application depends on how closely the estimated operating temperature and elastic 
behaviour of the associated components 
– most importantly the housing – coincide 
with the actual conditions in operation  In 
this context, the effects of start-up at low 
ambient temperature must be included in 
the testing  
Considerations for preload
Depending on the bearing type, preload may 
be either radial or axial  Super-precision 
cylindrical roller bearings, for example, can 
only be preloaded radially because of their 
design, while angular contact ball bearings 
or tapered roller bearings can only be 
preloaded axially 
Single tapered roller bearings or angular 
contact ball bearings are generally mounted 
together with a second bearing of the same 
type and size in a back-to-back (load lines 
diverge, ig. 4) or face-to-face (load lines 
converge, ig. 5) arrangement  The same is 
true for single row angular contact ball 
The distance L between the pressure centres is longer when the bearings are 
arranged back -to -back compared to bearings that are arranged face -to-face  The 
back -to -back arrangement can accommodate larger tilting moments 
If the shaft temperature in operation is 
higher than the housing temperature, the 
preload, which was adjusted at ambient 
temperature during mounting, will change  
Since thermal growth of a shaft makes it 
larger both in the axial and in the radial 
direction, the back-to-back arrangements 
are less sensitive to thermal effects than the 
face-to-face arrangements 
When adjusting preload in a bearing system, it is important that the established 
preload value is attained with the least possible variation  To reduce variation when 
mounting tapered roller bearings, the shaft 
should be turned several times to ensure 
that the rollers are in correct contact with 
the guide lange of the inner ring  
Preloading with springs
By preloading bearings it is possible to 
reduce the noise in, for example, small electric motors or similar applications  In this 
example, the bearing arrangement comprises a preloaded single row deep groove 
ball bearing at each end of the shaft (ig. 6)  
The simplest method of applying preload is 
to use a wave spring  The spring acts on the 
outer ring of one of the two bearings  This 
outer ring must be able to be axially 
The preload force remains practically constant, even when there is axial displacement 
of the bearing as a result of thermal 
elongation 
The requisite preload force can be estimated using 
F = k d 
F = preload force [kN]
k = a factor, described in the following text
d = bearing bore diameter [mm]
Back-to-back arrangement, tapered roller 
Face-to-face arrangement, tapered roller 
Preloading with springs


For small electric motors, values of between 
0,005 and 0,01 are used for the factor k. If 
preload is used primarily to protect the bearing from the damage caused by external 
vibrations when stationary, then greater 
preload is required and k = 0,02 should be 
used.
Spring loading is also a common method 
of applying preload to angular contact ball 
bearings in high-speed grinding spindles. 
The method is not suitable for bearing applications where a high degree of stiffness is 
required, where the direction of axial load 
changes, or where undeined peak loads can 
occur.
For additional information, refer to 
Bearing preload, (skf.com/go/17000-B7).
Bearing tolerance 
class
The dimensional and geometrical tolerances 
of bearings are described by their tolerance 
classes (Tolerances, page 36). In addition to 
the Normal, P6 and P5 tolerance classes, 
SKF also manufactures bearings with even 
narrower tolerances. These include P4, UP 
and other tolerance classes. For information 
about SKF bearings that have a tolerance 
class better than P5, refer to 
skf.com/super-precision.
Select the tolerance class for a bearing 
based on the application requirements for 
precision of rotation and operational speed 
(diagram 4).
If the application requirements for precision of rotation are moderate (Selecting its, 
page 140) and operational speed is moderate (Speed limitations, page 135), then 
choose a Normal tolerance class. If the 
requirements for precision of rotation and/or 
operational speed are greater than moderate, then choose an appropriately more 
accurate tolerance class (diagram 4).
For detailed information about standard 
tolerances, please refer to the product 
sections.
The main cage types are described in Components and materials, page 24. Additionally, 
information about standard cages, and possible cage options, for a particular bearing 
type is given in the relevant product section. 
If a bearing with a non -standard cage is 
required, check availability before ordering.
There are fundamental design differences 
between bearings which, together with the 
inluence of bearing size, make certain cage 
designs necessary. For example:
• some bearing types need either split or 
snap-type cages, because they are 
assembled after the rings and rolling elements have been sub-assembled
• other bearing types need roller-guided 
cages, to be self-containing
• bearings of a certain combination of size 
and series need ring-guided cages, to limit 
contact stress between rolling elements 
and cage
Given the speciic functional demands and 
quantity of bearings being manufactured, 
the material and manufacturing methods 
are chosen to provide the most reliable and 
cost-effective cage.
Cages are mechanically stressed during 
bearing operation by frictional, impact, centrifugal and inertial forces. They can also be 
chemically inluenced by certain organic solvents or coolants, lubricants, and lubricant 
additives. Therefore, the material type used 
for a cage has a signiicant inluence on the 
suitability of a rolling bearing for a particular 
application.

Steel cages
Steel cages can be used at operating temperatures up to 300 °C (570 °F)  
Sheet steel cages
Stamped sheet steel cages are made of low 
carbon steel  These lightweight cages have 
relatively high strength and, for some bearing types, can be surface treated to further 
reduce friction and wear in critical 
Machined steel cages
Machined steel cages are normally made of 
non-alloyed structural steel  To reduce friction and wear, some machined steel cages 
are surface treated  
Machined steel cages are not affected by 
the mineral or synthetic oil-based lubricants 
normally used for rolling bearings, or by the 
organic solvents used to clean bearings  
Brass cages
Brass cages can be used at operating temperatures up to 250 °C (480 °F)  
Sheet brass cages
Stamped sheet brass cages are used for 
some small and medium -size bearings  In 
applications such as refrigeration compressors that use ammonia, machined brass or 
steel cages should be used 
Machined brass cages
Most brass cages are machined from cast or 
wrought brass  They are unaffected by most 
common bearing lubricants, including synthetic oils and greases, and can be cleaned 
using organic solvents  
Polymer cages
Polyamide 66
Polyamide 66 (PA66) is the most commonly 
used material for injection moulded cages  
This material, with or without glass ibres, is 
characterized by a favourable combination of 
strength and elasticity  The mechanical 
properties, such as strength and elasticity, 
of polymer materials are temperature 
dependent and subject to ageing  The factors 
that most inluence the ageing process are 
temperature, time and the medium (lubricant) to which the polymer is exposed  The 
relationship between these factors for glass 
ibre reinforced PA66 is shown in diagram 5  
Cage life decreases with increasing temperature and the aggressiveness of the lubricant 
Therefore, whether polyamide cages are 
suitable for a speciic application depends on 
the operating conditions and life requirements  The classiication of lubricants into 
“aggressive” and “mild” is relected by the 
“permissible operating temperature” for 
cages made of glass ibre reinforced PA66 
with various lubricants (table 1)  The permissible operating temperature in table 1 is 
deined as the temperature that provides a 
cage ageing life of at least 10 000 operating 
hours 
Some media are even more “aggressive” 
than those speciied in table 1  A typical 
ex ample is ammonia, used as a refrigerant 
in compressors  In those cases, cages made 
of glass ibre reinforced PA66 should not be 
used at operating temperatures above 
70 °C (160 °F) 
Polyamide loses its elasticity at low temperatures  Therefore, cages made of glass 
ibre reinforced PA66 should not be used in 
applications where the continuous operating 
temperature is below –40 °C (–40 °F) 
 (120) 
(210) 
(300) 
(390)

Cage ageing life for glass ibre reinforced PA66
Polyamide 46
Glass ibre reinforced polyamide 46 (PA46) is 
the standard cage material for some small 
and medium- size CARB toroidal roller bearings  The permissible operating temperature 
is 15 °C (25 °F) higher than for glass ibre 
reinforced PA66 
Polyetheretherketone
Glass ibre reinforced polyetheretherketone 
(PEEK) is more suitable for demanding conditions regarding high speeds, chemical 
resistance or high temperatures than PA66 
and PA46  The exceptional properties of 
PEEK provide a superior combination of 
strength and lexibility, high operating temperature range, and high chemical and wear 
resistance  Because of these outstanding 
features, PEEK cages are commonly available for hybrid and/or super- precision ball 
and cylindrical roller bearings  The material 
does not show signs of ageing by temperature or oil additives up to 200 °C (390 °F)  
However, the maximum temperature for 
high -speed use is limited to 150 °C 
(300 °F) as this is the softening temperature 
of the polymer  
1) The permissible operating temperature is deined as the temperature that provides a cage ageing life of at least 10 000 operating 
hours  
2) Generally, “aggressive” lubricants have a permissible temperature that is less than 120 °C (250 °F)

In addition to the materials described previously, SKF bearings for special applications 
may be itted with cages made of other engineered polymers, light alloys or special cast 
iron. For additional information about alternative cage materials, contact SKF. 
Integral sealing
Integral sealing can signiicantly prolong 
bearing service life by keeping lubricant in 
the bearing and contaminants out.
The various types of capping devices that 
are available for SKF bearings are described 
in Components and materials, page 24.
Information about which integral seal 
options are available for a particular bearing 
type is given in the relevant product section.
Additional options
Coatings
Coating is a well-established method to 
upgrade materials and to provide bearings 
with additional beneits for speciic application conditions. Various coating methods 
developed by SKF are available and have 
been proven successful in many applications.
Black oxide
Black oxide coating of rings and rollers 
improves reliability and performance in 
highly demanding applications, especially 
under low load conditions and high vibration. 
In addition, it improves corrosion protection 
and lubricant adhesion on the bearing 
surfaces.
SKF also supplies customized black oxide 
coating layers that are optimized for best 
tribological results and highest bearing performance, produced using well-deined processes and ine tuned to the individual steel 
grade, bearing type and size. SKF’s evaluation and quality control technology for the 
black oxide application process includes a 
scanning electron microscope and a patented examination method.
NoWear
NoWear is a wear -resistant surface coating 
that applies a low- friction carbon coating on 
the bearing inner ring raceway(s) and/or the 
rolling elements. It can withstand long periods of operation under marginal lubrication 
conditions. For additional information, refer 
to NoWear coated bearings, page 1060
INSOCOAT
INSOCOAT bearings are standard bearings 
that have the external surfaces of their inner 
or outer ring plasma -sprayed with an aluminium oxide, impregnated with a resin 
sealant, to form a coating. It offers resistance 
to the damage that can be caused by the 
passage of stray electric current through the 
bearing. For additional information, refer to 
INSOCOAT bearings, page 1030.
Other coatings are available that provide an 
alternative to stainless steel bearings (especially for ready -to-mount bearing units) that 
are used in a corrosive environment.

Features for special 
requirements
SKF supplies many more bearing variants, in 
addition to those presented in the product 
sections, for accomplishing various tasks and 
satisfying special application needs  Among 
the more common special variants manufactured by SKF are:

B.8 Sealing, mounting and 


External sealing
Bearing arrangements generally include a 
shaft, bearings, housing(s), lubricant, associated components, and seals  Seals are vital 
to the cleanliness of the lubricant and the 
service life of the bearings 
The section on Integral sealing, page 189, 
gives a general description of the integral 
seals used in capped bearings  For detailed 
information, refer to the relevant product 
sections  
This section describes seals outside the 
bearing, and how they affect bearing performance  Because of their importance for 
bearing applications, this section deals 
exclusively with non-contact and contact 
shaft seals, their various designs and 
executions 
This section is the last step in the Bearing 
selection process and it covers:
• External sealing 
How to select appropriate seals for rolling 
bearing applications and the different 
types of seal available 
• Mounting and dismounting 
The preparation and guidelines for 
mounting and dismounting bearings 
• Inspection and monitoring 
Various aspects of inspecting and monitoring bearings in operation for the purpose of preventing problems, and an

B 8 Sealing, mounting and 


External sealing
Seal selection criteria
Seals for bearing applications should provide 
maximum protection with a minimum 
amount of friction and wear, under the prevailing operating conditions  Because bearing performance and service life are so 
closely tied to the effectiveness and cleanliness of the lubricant, the seal is a key component  For additional information on the 
inluence of solid contaminants on bearing 
performance, refer to Contamination factor, 
ηc, page 104
Many factors must be considered when 
selecting the most suitable seal for a particular bearing-shaft-housing system  These 
include: 
• the lubricant type: oil or grease
• the contaminant type: particles or luid or 
both
• the circumferential speed at the seal lip
• the shaft arrangement: horizontal or 
vertical
• possible shaft misalignment or delection
• run-out and concentricity
• available space
• seal friction and the resulting temperature 
increase
• environmental inluences
• cost
• required operating time
• maintenance requirements
For additional information, refer to Power 
transmission seals, (skf com/seals) 
Seal types
The purpose of a seal is to retain lubricant 
and prevent any contaminants from entering 
into a controlled environment  
There are several basic seal types: 
• non-contact seals
• contact seals
• static seals
Non-contact radial shaft seals form a narrow gap between the stationary and the 
rotating component  The gap can be 
arranged axially, radially or in combination  
Non-contact seals, which range from simple 
gap-type seals to multi-stage labyrinths 
(ig. 1), do not wear  
Seals in contact with sliding surfaces are 
called contact seals and are used to seal 
passages between machine components 
that move relative to each other, either linearly or circumferentially  
The most common contact seal is the 
radial shaft seal (ig. 2), which is installed 
between a stationary and a rotating 
component  
Seals between stationary surfaces are 
called static seals  Their effectiveness 
depends on the radial or axial deformation of 
their cross section when installed  Gaskets 
(ig. 3) and O-rings (ig. 4) are typical ex- 
amples of static seals  
Multi-stage labyrinth seal
Radial shaft seal

Non-contact seals
The simplest seal used outside a bearing is 
the gap-type seal, which creates a small gap 
between the shaft and housing cover (ig. 5)  
This type of seal is mainly used for grease 
lubricated applications that operate in dry, 
dust-free environments  To enhance the 
effectiveness of this seal, one or more concentric grooves can be machined in the 
housing cover bore at the shaft end (ig. 6)  
The grease emerging through the gap ills 
the grooves and helps to prevent entry of 
contaminants  
With oil lubrication and horizontal shafts, 
helical grooves can be machined into the 
shaft or housing bore, either right-handed 
or left-handed, depending on the direction 
of shaft rotation (ig. 7)  These grooves are 
designed to return emerging oil to the bearing; therefore, it is essential that the shaft 
rotates in one direction only  
Other shapes can be machined into the 
shaft  Non-helical grooves may be used on 
the shaft and in the housing; these function 
as disruptors/lingers  Additional shaft collars 
can prevent oil leakage, whatever the direction of rotation  
Single or multi-stage labyrinth seals, typically used with grease lubrication, are considerably more effective than simple gaptype seals, but are also more expensive  
Their effectiveness can be further improved 
by periodically applying grease, via a duct, to 
the labyrinth passages  The passages of the 
labyrinth seal can be arranged axially (ig. 8) 
or radially (ig. 9), depending on the housing 
type (split or non-split), mounting proced- 
ures, available space, etc  The radial gaps of 
the labyrinth (ig. 8) remain unchanged when 
axial displacement of the shaft occurs in operation; therefore, the gaps can be very narrow  
Where angular misalignment of the shaft 
relative to the housing can occur, labyrinths 
with inclined passages can be used (ig. 10)  
Effective and inexpensive labyrinth seals 
can be made using SKF sealing washers 
(ig. 11)  Sealing effectiveness increases with 
the number of washer sets and can be further improved by incorporating locked 
washers  For additional information on these 
sealing washers, refer to Power transmission 
seals, (skf com/seals)  
Rotating discs (ig. 12) are often itted to 
the shaft to act as a shield  Flingers, grooves 
or discs are also used with oil lubrication  
The oil from the linger is collected in a channel in the housing and returned to the housing sump through suitable ducts (ig. 13)

External sealing
Contact seals
There are four common types of contact 
seals:
• radial shaft seals
• V-ring seals 
• axial clamp seals
• mechanical seals
The seal type selected for a particular application typically depends on:
• the primary purpose of the seal (to retain 
lubricant or exclude contaminants)
• the type of lubricant (oil, grease or other)
• the operating conditions (speed, temperature, pressure and environment)
Radial shaft seals
Radial shaft seals (ig. 14 and ig. 15) are 
contact seals that are used for oil and grease 
lubricated applications  For detailed information, refer to the SKF catalogue Industrial 
shaft seals  These ready-to-mount compon- 
ents typically consist of a metal reinforcement or casing, a synthetic rubber body, a 
seal lip and a garter spring  The seal lip is 
pressed against the shaft by the garter 
spring  Depending on the seal material and 
medium to be retained and/or excluded, 
commonly used materials for radial shaft 
seals can be used at temperatures between 
–55 °C (–65 °F) and +200 °C (390 °F)  
The seal counterface, that part of the 
shaft where the seal lip makes contact, is of 
vital importance to sealing effectiveness  The 
surface hardness of the counterface should 
be at least 45 HRC at a depth of at least 
0,3 mm. The surface texture should be in 
accordance with ISO 4288 and within the 
guidelines of Ra = 0,2 to 0,5 μm. In applications where speeds are low, lubrication is 
good, and contamination levels are minimal, 
a lower hardness can be acceptable. For oil 
lubrication, to avoid the pumping effect 
induced by helical grinding marks, SKF recommends plunge grinding the counterface.
If the primary purpose of the radial shaft 
seal is lubricant retention, the seal should be 
mounted with the lip facing inward (ig. 14). 
If the primary purpose is to exclude contaminants, the lip should face outward, away 
from the bearing (ig. 15).
SKF can also supply machined polyur- 
ethane radial shaft seals.

 WARNING
Safety precautions for luoro rubber 
and Polytetraluoroethylene
Fluoro rubber (FKM) and Polytetraluoroethylene (PTFE) are very stable and 
harmless up to normal operating temperatures of 200 °C (390 °F)  However, 
if exposed to temperatures above 
300 °C (570 °F), such as ire or the open 
lame of a cutting torch, FKM and PTFE 
give off hazardous fumes  These fumes 
can be harmful if inhaled, as well as if 
they contact the eyes  In addition, once 
the seals have been heated to such temperatures, they are dangerous to handle 
even after they have cooled  Therefore, 
they should never come in contact with 
the skin  
If it is necessary to handle bearings 
with seals that have been subjected to 
high temperatures, such as when dismounting the bearing, the following 
safety precautions should be observed: 
• Always wear protective goggles, 
gloves and appropriate breathing 
apparatus  
• Place all of the remains of the seals in 
an airtight plastic container marked 
with a symbol for “material will etch”  
• Follow the safety precautions in the 
appropriate safety data sheet (SDS) 
If there is contact with the seals, wash 
hands with soap and plenty of water 
and, if contact has been made with the 
eyes, lush eyes with plenty of water and 
consult a doctor immediately  If the 
fumes have been inhaled, consult a doctor immediately  
The user is responsible for the correct 
use of the product during its service life 
and its proper disposal  SKF takes no 
responsibility for the improper handling 
of FKM or PTFE, or for any injury resulting from their use 


V-ring seals
V-ring seals (ig. 16) can be used with either 
oil or grease lubrication  The elastic rubber 
body of the seal grips the shaft and rotates 
with it, while the seal lip exerts a light axial 
pressure on a stationary component, such as 
a housing  Depending on the material, 
V-rings can be used at operating temperatures between –40 °C (–40 °F) and 
+200 °C (390 °F)  They are simple to install 
and permit relatively large angular misalignments of the shaft at low speeds  
The recommended counterface surface 
inish (surface texture) depends on the circumferential speed (table 1)  At circumferential speeds above 8 m/s, the body of the 
seal must be located axially on the shaft  At 
speeds above 12 m/s, the body must be prevented from lifting from the shaft  A sheet 
metal support ring can be used to do this  
When circumferential speeds exceed 15 m/s, 
the seal lip lifts away from the counterface 
and the V-ring becomes a gap-type seal  
V -ring seals have good sealing abilities, 
which can be attributed to the body of the 
seal, which acts as a linger, repelling dirt 
and luids  As a result, these seals are generally arranged outside the housing in grease 
lubricated applications and inside the housing, with the lip pointing away from the 
bearing, in oil lubricated applications  Used 
as a secondary seal, V -rings protect the primary seal from excessive contaminants and 
moisture  
For added protection in extremely contaminated applications, SKF also supplies 
MVR seals (ig. 17 and SKF catalogue Industrial shaft seals) 
Axial clamp seals 
Axial clamp seals (ig. 18) are used as secondary seals for large-diameter shafts in 
applications where protection is required for 
the primary seal  They are clamped in position on a non- rotating component and seal 
axially against a rotating counterface  For 
this type of seal, it is suficient if the counterface is ine-turned and has a surface texture 
of Ra = 2,5 μm  
Mechanical seals
Mechanical seals (ig. 19) are used to seal 
grease or oil lubricated applications, where 
speeds are relatively low and operating conditions arduous  Mechanical seals consist of 
two sliding steel rings with inely inished 
sealing surfaces and two Belleville rubber 
compound washers, which position the sliding rings in the housing bore and provide the 
necessary preload force to the sealing surfaces  There are no special requirements for 
the mating surfaces in the housing bore  
Other seals
Felt seals (ig. 20) are generally used with 
grease lubrication  They are simple, cost -
effective and can be used at circumferential 
speeds of up to 4 m/s and at operating temperatures up to 100 °C (210 °F)  The counterface should be ground to a surface texture 
of Ra ≤ 3,2 μm  The effectiveness of a felt 
seal can be improved substantially by 
mounting a simple labyrinth seal as a secondary seal  Before being inserted in the 
housing groove, felt seals should be soaked 
in oil at about 80 °C (175 °F) prior to 
mounting  
Metal seals (ig. 21) are simple, cost- 
effective and space-saving seals for grease 
lubricated bearings  The seals are clamped 
against either the inner or outer ring and 
exert a resilient axial pressure against the 
other ring  After a certain running-in period, 
a narrow gap forms and these become 
non-contact seals 
The surface inish must not be lower than Ra = 0,05 μm (2 μin )

Mounting and 
Rolling bearings are reliable machine elements that can provide long service life, if they 
are mounted properly  Proper mounting 
requires experience, accuracy, a clean work 
environment, correct working methods and 
the appropriate tools  SKF offers a comprehensive assortment of high-quality tools for 
this purpose  For detailed information, refer 
to Maintenance products, (skf com/mapro) 
Mounting bearings correctly is often more 
dificult than it appears, especially where 
large bearings are concerned  As part of the 
SKF Services and Solutions program, SKF 
offers seminars and hands-on training 
courses  Mounting and maintenance assistance may also be available from your local 
SKF company or SKF Authorized Distributor 
The information provided in this section is 
quite general and is intended primarily to 
indicate what must be considered by 
machine and equipment designers to facilitate bearing mounting and dismounting  It 
includes:
• Mounting
• Test running
• Machines on standby
• Dismounting

Before mounting, be sure you have all the 
necessary parts, tools, equipment and data 
available and ready to use  Review any drawings or instructions to determine the correct 
sequence and orientation in which compon- 
ents are to be assembled  Leave the bearings in their original packages until immediately before mounting so that they are not 
exposed to any contaminants  If there is a 
risk that the bearings have become contam- 
inated because of improper handling or 
damaged packaging, they should be washed, 
dried and inspected before mounting  
Assembly area
Bearings should be mounted in a dry, dustfree area, away from machines producing 
swarf and dust  When bearings have to be 
mounted in an unprotected area, which is 
often the case with large bearings, steps 
should be taken to protect the bearing and 
mounting position from contaminants such 
as dust, dirt and moisture  This can be done 
by covering or wrapping bearings and 
machine components with plastic or foil  
Checking associated components
Housings, shafts, seals and other components of the bearing-shaft-housing system 
should be checked to make sure they are 
clean  This is particularly important for lubrication holes and threaded holes, lead-ins or 
grooves where remnants of previous 
machining operations might have collected  
Also, make sure that all unpainted surfaces 
of cast housings are free of core sand and 
that any burrs are removed  
When all components have been cleaned 
and dried, check the dimensional and 
geometrical tolerances of each piece  The 
bearings only perform satisfactorily if the 
associated components comply with the prescribed tolerances  The diameters of cylindrical shaft and housing seats are usually 
checked with a micrometer, or internal 
gauge, at two cross sections and in four 
directions (ig. 22)  Tapered shaft seats can 
be checked using a GRA 30 series ring 
gauge or a DMB or 9205 series taper gauge 
refer to skf com, or a sine bar

Removing the preservative
Normally, the preservative applied to new 
bearings does not need to be removed  It is 
only necessary to wipe off the outside and 
bore surfaces  However, if the lubricant to be 
used is not compatible with the preservative, 
the bearing should be washed and dried 
carefully  Bearings capped with seals or 
shields are illed with grease and should not 
be washed prior to mounting  
Bearing handling and safety
SKF recommends use of personal protection 
clothing and equipment, such as gloves, 
safety shoes and goggles, as well as carrying 
and lifting tools (ig. 23) that have been specially designed for handling bearings  Using 
the proper tools enhances safety, while saving time and effort 
When handling hot or oily bearings, SKF 
recommends wearing the appropriate heat 
or oil resistant gloves (ig. 24) 
For large, heavy bearings, use lifting tackle 
that supports the bearing from the bottom 
(ig. 25)  A spring between the hook and 
tackle can facilitate positioning of the bearing onto the shaft 
To ease lifting, large bearings can be provided, on request, with threaded holes in the 
ring side faces to accommodate eye bolts  
These holes are designed to bear only the 
weight of the bearing, because the size and 
depth of the hole is limited by the ring thickness  Make sure that the eye bolts are only 
subjected to load in the direction of the 
shank axis (ig. 26)  


Fig. 26

the shank axis
Methods and tools
Depending on the bearing type and size, 
mechanical, thermal or hydraulic methods 
are used for mounting (table 2, page 202)  
Bearing sizes are categorized as follows:
• small → d ≤ 80 mm
• medium-size → 80 mm < d < 200 mm
• large → d ≥ 200 mm
In all cases, it is important that the bearing 
rings, cages and rolling elements or seals 
are never struck directly with any hard object 
and that the mounting force is never applied 
through the rolling elements  
For an interference it, the mating surfaces should be coated with a thin layer of 
light oil  For a loose it, the mating surfaces 
should be coated with SKF anti-fretting 
agent  
Mounting bearings with a 
Non-separable bearings
With non-separable bearings, the ring that 
requires the tighter it is usually mounted 
irst  
Separable bearings
With separable bearings, the inner ring can 
be mounted independently of the outer ring, 
which simpliies mounting, particularly 
where both rings have an interference it  
When mounting the shaft and inner ring 
assembly into the housing containing the 
outer ring, careful alignment is required to 
avoid scoring the raceways and rolling elements  When mounting cylindrical or needle 
roller bearings with an inner ring without 
langes or with a lange on one side only, a 
guiding sleeve should be used (ig. 27)  The 
outside diameter of the sleeve should be the 
same as the raceway diameter of the inner 
ring and should be machined to tolerance 
class d10 for cylindrical roller bearings, 
and to tolerance 0/–0,025 mm for needle

Mounting a self-aligning ball bearing by 
use of an intermediate mounting ring
Cold mounting
If the it is not too tight, small bearings can 
be driven into position by applying light 
hammer blows to a bearing itting tool 
(ig. 28)  The tool enables the mounting 
force to be applied centrally 
If a bearing has to be pressed onto the 
shaft and into the housing bore at the same 
time, the mounting force must be applied 
equally to both rings and the abutment surfaces of the mounting tool must lie in the 
same plane  Whenever possible, mounting 
should be done with an SKF bearing itting 
tool (ig. 28) 
With self-aligning bearings, the use of an 
intermediate mounting ring prevents the 
outer ring from tilting and swivelling when 
the bearing and shaft assembly is introduced 
into the housing bore (ig. 29)  The balls of 
larger self-aligning ball bearings in the 12 
and 13 series protrude from the sides of the 
bearing, therefore the mounting ring must 
have a recess

SKF electric induction heater
Hot mounting
It is generally not possible to mount larger 
bearings without heating either the bearing 
or the housing, as the force required to 
mount a bearing increases considerably with 
increasing bearing size 
The requisite difference in temperature 
between the bearing ring and shaft or housing depends on the degree of interference 
and the diameter of the bearing seat  Generally, open bearings must not be heated to 
more than 120 °C (250 °F)  SKF does not 
recommend heating bearings capped with 
seals or shields above 80 °C (175 °F)  However, if higher temperatures are necessary, 
make sure that the temperature does not 
exceed the permissible temperature of either 
the seal or grease, whichever is lowest 
When heating bearings, local overheating 
must be avoided  To heat bearings evenly 
and reliably, SKF recommends using SKF 
electric induction heaters (ig. 30)  If hotplates are used, the bearing must be turned 
over a number of times  The seals on sealed 
bearings should never contact the heating 
plate directly  Place a ring between the plate 
and bearing  Read and follow the safety precautions on page 197 
For additional information about these 
mounting methods, refer to the SKF bearing 
maintenance handbook 
Mounting adjusted bearing 
arrangements
The following recommendations refer only to 
the adjustment of the mounted clearance for 
bearing arrangements with single row 
angular contact ball bearings or tapered 
The mounted clearance of single row 
angular contact ball bearings and single row 
tapered roller bearings is only established 
when the bearing is adjusted against a second bearing  Usually, they are arranged 
back-to-back or face-to-face, and one bearing ring is axially displaced until a given 
clearance or preload is obtained  For information about bearing preload, refer to 
Selecting preload, page 186  
The appropriate value for the clearance to 
be obtained when mounting depends on the 
bearing size and arrangement, and operating conditions such as load and temperature  
Since there is a deinite relationship between 
the radial and axial clearance of angular 
contact ball bearings and tapered roller 
bearings, it is suficient to specify one value, 
generally the axial clearance for the 
arrangement  This speciied value is then 
obtained by measuring the clearance during 
adjustment and by loosening or tightening a 
nut on the shaft or a threaded ring in the 
housing bore or by inserting calibrated 
washers or shims between one of the bearing rings and its abutment  The actual 
method used to adjust and measure the 
clearance depends on whether this is an 
occasional or repetitive process  
One way to check the axial clearance in a 
bearing arrangement is to use a dial indicator attached to the hub (ig. 31)  When 
adjusting tapered roller bearings and measuring clearance, the shaft or housing should 
be turned through several revolutions in 
Fig. 31
Checking of axial clearance using a dial 
indicator
both directions to be sure that there is 
proper contact of the roller ends with the 
guide lange on the inner ring  Without 
proper contact, the measured result will not 
be correct 
Mounting bearings with a 
For bearings with a tapered bore, inner rings 
are always mounted with an interference it  
The degree of interference is determined by 
how far the bearing is driven up onto a 
tapered shaft seat or an adapter or withdrawal sleeve  As the bearing is driven up the 
tapered seat, its radial internal clearance is 
reduced  This reduction in clearance, or the 
axial drive-up distance, can be measured to 
determine the degree of interference and 
the proper it  Recommended values of 
clearance reduction and axial drive-up are 
listed in the relevant product section 
The SKF Drive-up Method is a reliable and 
well-proven method for mounting SKF 
bearings on tapered seats  For additional 
information, refer to the SKF Drive-up 
Method Program (skf com/drive-up)

(d ≤ 80 mm), can be driven up onto a 
tapered seat using either a bearing itting 
tool or, preferably, a lock nut  For adapter 
sleeves, use the sleeve nut that can be tightened with a hook or impact spanner  Withdrawal sleeves can be driven into the bearing 
bore using a bearing itting tool or a nut  
Starting from a 50 mm thread, SKF hydraul- 
ic nuts can also be used. 
Medium-size and large bearings
Larger bearings, with bore diameters 
greater than 80 mm (d > 80 mm), require 
considerably more force to mount  Therefore, SKF hydraulic nuts should be used  
Where applicable, SKF also recommends 
using shafts and sleeves with grooves and 
ducts for the oil injection method  When 
combining the two methods, bearing 
mounting and dismounting becomes much 
faster, easier and safer  For additional information about the oil injection equipment 
required for both the hydraulic nut and the 
oil injection method, refer to skf com/mapro 
and skf com/mount  


Mounting with SKF hydraulic nuts
Bearings with a tapered bore can be 
mounted with the aid of an SKF hydraulic 
nut:
• on a tapered shaft seat (ig. 32)
• on an adapter sleeve (ig. 33)
• on a withdrawal sleeve (ig. 34)
The hydraulic nut can be positioned onto a 
threaded section of the shaft (ig. 32), or 
onto the thread of a sleeve (ig. 33 and 
ig. 34)  The annular piston abuts the inner 
ring of the bearing (ig. 32 and ig. 33) or a 
stop on the shaft, which can be either a nut 
on a shaft thread (ig. 34) or a plate attached 
to the end of the shaft  Pumping oil into the 
hydraulic nut displaces the piston axially with 
the force needed to drive the inner ring up 
the taper for accurate and safe mounting  
Oil injection method
With the oil injection method, oil under high 
pressure is injected via ducts and distribution grooves between the bearing and bearing seat to form an oil ilm  This oil ilm separates the mating surfaces and considerably 
reduces the friction between them  This 
method is typically used when mounting 
bearings directly on tapered shaft seats 
(ig. 35)  The necessary ducts and grooves 
should be an integral part of the shaft 
design  This method can also be used to 
mount bearings on adapter or withdrawal 
sleeves if they are equipped with the relevant 
features, ducts and grooves  
A spherical roller bearing mounted on a 
withdrawal sleeve with oil ducts is shown in 
ig. 36  Oil is injected between all mating 
surfaces so that the withdrawal sleeve can 
be pressed into the bearing bore as the bolts 
are tightened

Verifying the interference it
During mounting, the degree of interference 
is normally determined by one of the following methods:
• measuring the clearance reduction
• measuring the lock nut tightening angle
• measuring the axial drive-up
• measuring the inner ring expansion
For self-aligning ball bearings, feeling the 
clearance reduction by swivelling the outer 
ring is an additional method (Mounting, 
page 447)  


Measuring the clearance reduction
A feeler gauge is most often used to measure the radial internal clearance in  
medium-size and large spherical and CARB 
toroidal roller bearings  Recommended values for the reduction of radial internal clearance to obtain the correct interference it are 
listed in the relevant product section 
Before mounting, measure the clearance 
between the outer ring and upper-most 
roller (ig. 37)  During mounting, measure 
the clearance between the inner or outer 
ring and lowest roller, depending on the 
bearing internal design (ig. 38)  
Before measuring, rotate the inner or 
outer ring a few times  Both bearing rings 
and the roller complement must be centrically arranged relative to each other  
For larger bearings, especially those with 
a thin-walled outer ring, the measurements 
are affected by the elastic deformation of the 
rings, caused by the weight of the bearing or 
the force to draw the feeler gauge blade 
through the gap between the raceway and 
an unloaded roller  To establish the “true” 
clearance before and after mounting, use 
the following procedure (ig. 39): 
1 Measure the clearance “c” at the 12 o’clock 
position for a standing bearing or at the 6 
o’clock position for an unmounted bearing 
hanging from the shaft 
2 Measure the clearance “a” at the 9 o’clock 
position and “b” at the 3 o’clock position 
without moving the bearing 
3 Obtain the “true” radial internal clearance 
with relatively good accuracy from 
0,5 (a + b + c).
Measuring the lock nut tightening angle
This method can be used when mounting 
bearings with a bore diameter d ≤ 120 mm  
Recommended values for the tightening 
angle α are listed in the relevant product 
section  
Before starting the inal tightening proced- 
ure, push the bearing up onto the tapered 
seat until it is irmly in position  By tightening 
the nut through the recommended angle α 
(ig. 40), the bearing is driven up over the 
proper distance on the tapered seat  The 
bearing inner ring then has the requisite 
interference it  The residual clearance 
should be checked if possible

Measuring the axial drive-up
Bearings with a tapered bore can be 
mounted by measuring the axial drive-up of 
the inner ring on its seat  Recommended 
values for the required axial drive-up are 
listed in the relevant product section 
However, the SKF Drive-up Method is 
recommended for medium-size and large 
bearings  This method provides a reliable 
and easy way to determine the degree of 
interference  The correct it is achieved by 
controlling the axial displacement of the 
bearing from a pre-determined position  The 
equipment for the SKF Drive-up Method is 
shown in ig. 41  It includes an SKF hydraulic 
nut (1) itted with a dial indicator (2), and a 
hydraulic pump (3) itted with a pressure 
gauge (4) 
The SKF Drive-up Method is based on a 
two-step mounting procedure (ig. 42):
• Step 1
Push the bearing to its starting position by 
applying the prescribed pressure to the 
• Step 2
Increase the pressure on the hydraulic nut 
so the bearing inner ring is pushed further 
on its tapered seat to its inal position  The 
prescribed displacement is measured by 
the dial indicator 
Recommended values for the requisite oil 
pressure to reach the start position and the 
axial displacement to reach the inal position 
for individual bearings are available from the 
SKF Drive-up Method Program 
(skf com/drive-up) 
Measuring the inner ring expansion
Measuring the inner ring expansion is a 
quick and accurate method for determining 
the correct position of large spherical and 
CARB toroidal roller bearings on their seats 
(d ≥ 340 mm, depending on the series)  To 
apply this method, use common hydraulic 
mounting tools and a SensorMount, which 
consists of a bearing with a sensor embedded in the inner ring and a dedicated handheld indicator (ig. 43)  Aspects such as 
bearing size, shaft material and design (solid 
or hollow), and surface inish do not need 
any special consideration  
Test running
Once assembly is complete, an application 
should undergo a test run to determine that 
all components are operating properly  During a test run, the application should run 
under partial load and, where there is a wide 
speed range, at low or moderate speeds 
IMPORTANT: A rolling bearing should 
never be started up unloaded and then rapidly accelerated to high speed, as there is a 
signiicant risk that the rolling elements will 
slide and damage the raceways  A minimum 
bearing load needs to be applied (refer to 
Minimum load in the relevant product 
section) 
Any noise or vibration can be checked 
using SKF condition monitoring equipment  
Normally, bearings produce an even “purring” noise  Whistling or screeching indicates 
inadequate lubrication  An uneven rumbling 
or hammering is, in most cases, caused by 
the presence of contaminants in the bearing 
or to bearing damage caused during 
mounting 
An increase in bearing temperature 
immediately after start-up is normal  In the 
case of grease lubrication, the temperature 
does not drop until the grease has been 
evenly distributed in the bearing arrangement, after which an equilibrium temperature is reached  Unusually high or constantly 
peaking temperatures indicate too much 
lubricant in the arrangement, too heavy 
preload or that the bearing is radially or axially distorted  Other causes could be that 
associated components have not been made 
or mounted correctly, or that the seals are 
generating too much heat

During the test run, or immediately afterwards, check the seals, any lubrication systems and all luid levels  If noise and vibration levels are severe, it is advisable to check 
the lubricant for signs of contamination 
Machines on standby
Machines on standby should be rotated or 
run as frequently as possible to redistribute 
the lubricant within the bearings and change 
the position relative to the raceways to 
reduce the risk of false brinelling and standstill corrosion  
Dismounting
There are several reasons why bearings may 
need to be dismounted  For example, the 
bearings may need to be replaced or they 
may have to be removed to access other 
components  If bearings are to be used again 
after dismounting, the force used to dismount them must never be applied through 
the rolling elements 
With separable bearings, the ring with the 
rolling element and cage assembly can be 
removed independently of the other ring  
With non-separable bearings, the ring having the looser it should be withdrawn from 
its seat irst  To dismount a bearing with an 
interference it, the tools described in the 
following section can be used  The choice of 
tools depends on the bearing type, size and 
it (table 2, page 202)  Bearing sizes are 
categorized as follows:
• small → d ≤ 80 mm
• medium-size → 80 mm < d < 200 mm
• large → d ≥ 200 mm
Dismounting bearings itted

Cold dismounting
Small bearings can be dismounted from a 
shaft by applying light hammer blows via a 
suitable drift to the ring side face, or prefer- 
ably by using a mechanical puller  The claws 
must be applied to the inner ring or an adjacent component (ig. 44)  Dismounting is 
made easier if slots for the claws of a puller 
are provided in the shaft and/or housing 
shoulders  Alternatively, tapped holes in the 
housing shoulder can be provided to accommodate push-out bolts (ig. 45) 
Medium-size and large bearings generally 
require greater force than a mechanical tool 
can provide  Therefore, SKF recommends 
using either hydraulically assisted tools or 
the oil injection method, or both  Using the 
oil injection method assumes that the necessary oil supply ducts and distribution 
grooves have been designed into the shaft 
(ig. 46)

puller

Hot dismounting
Dismounting by heating is a suitable method 
when removing the inner rings of needle 
roller bearings or cylindrical roller bearings 
of the type NU, NJ and NUP  Two different 
tools for this purpose are common: heating 
rings and adjustable induction heaters 
Heating rings are typically used to mount 
and dismount the inner ring of small to 
medium-size bearings that are all the same 
size  Heating rings are made of light alloy  
They are radially slotted and equipped with 
insulated handles (ig. 47) 
If inner rings with different diameters are 
dismounted frequently, SKF recommends 
using an adjustable induction heater  These 
heaters (ig. 48) heat the inner ring rapidly 
without heating the shaft  
Special, ixed induction heaters have been 
developed to dismount the inner rings of 
large cylindrical roller bearings (ig. 49) 
Induction heaters and heating rings are 
available from SKF  For additional information, refer to the SKF bearing maintenance 
handbook or skf com/mapro  

 WARNING
Fire hazard  Never use an open lame 
for hot dismounting 
Dismounting bearings itted 
on a tapered shaft seat
Small bearings can be dismounted using a 
mechanical or hydraulic puller that engages 
the inner ring  Self-centring pullers equipped 
with spring-operated arms should be used 
to simplify the procedure and avoid damage 
to the bearing seat  If it is not possible to 
apply the claws of the puller to the inner 
ring, withdraw the bearing via the outer ring 
or use a puller in combination with a pulling 
plate (ig. 50) 
It is much easier and safer to dismount 
medium-size and large bearings when the 
oil injection method is used  This method 
injects oil, under high pressure, between the 
two tapered mating surfaces, via a supply 
duct and a distribution groove  This signiicantly reduces the friction between the two 
surfaces and separates the bearing from its 
seat (ig. 51)  

 WARNING
To avoid the risk of serious injury, attach 
a provision such as a lock nut or end 
plate to the shaft end to limit the bearing travel when it suddenly comes loose

Dismounting bearings itted 
on an adapter sleeve
To dismount small bearings itted on an 
adapter sleeve and a plain shaft, loosen the 
sleeve lock nut a few turns, then use a hammer of suitable size to tap a small steel block 
evenly around the bearing inner ring side 
face (ig. 52) 
For small bearings itted on an adapter 
sleeve and a stepped shaft with a spacing 
collar between the shoulder and the bearing 
side face, loosen the adapter sleeve lock nut 
a few turns and apply a couple of sharp 
hammer blows to a bearing itting tool abutting the sleeve lock nut (ig. 53) 
Using a hydraulic nut for dismounting 
bearings itted on an adapter sleeve and a 
stepped shaft with a spacing collar makes 
bearing dismounting easy  However, to use 
this method, you should mount a suitable 
stop that abuts the piston of the hydraulic 
nut (ig. 54)  If the sleeves are provided with 
oil supply ducts and distribution grooves, 
dismounting becomes easier because the oil 
injection method can be used

Dismounting bearings itted 
on a withdrawal sleeve
When dismounting a bearing itted on a 
withdrawal sleeve, the locking device (for 
example a lock nut or end plate) must be 
removed  
Small and medium-size bearings can be 
dismounted with a lock nut and a hook or 
impact spanner (ig. 55) 
Medium-size and large bearings itted on 
a withdrawal sleeve can be easily dismounted using a hydraulic nut 
Withdrawal sleeves with a bore diameter 
≥ 200 mm are provided, as standard, with 
two oil supply ducts and distribution grooves 
in both the bore and outside surface  When 
using the oil injection method, two hydraulic 
pumps or oil injectors and appropriate 
extension pipes are needed (ig. 56) 

 WARNING
To avoid the risk of serious injury, attach 
a stop behind the hydraulic nut at the 
shaft end (ig. 57)  The stop prevents the 
withdrawal sleeve and hydraulic nut 
from shooting off the shaft if the sleeve 
separates suddenly from its seat

Progress of damage
Inspection and 
monitoring
This section describes various aspects of 
inspecting and monitoring bearings in operation for the purpose of preventing problems  It also gives an introduction to troubleshooting and links to more detailed 
troubleshooting procedures  
Inspection during 
operation
Spotting early indications of bearing damage 
makes it possible to replace bearings during 
regularly scheduled maintenance  This 
avoids otherwise costly unscheduled 
machine downtime if a bearing fails  Important parameters for monitoring machine condition include noise, temperature and 
vibration  
Bearings that are worn or damaged usually exhibit identiiable symptoms (Troubleshooting, page 213)  There can be a number 
of possible causes and this section helps 
identify some of these 
For practical reasons, not all machines or 
machine functions can be monitored using 
advanced systems  In these cases, trouble 
can be detected by looking at or listening to 
the machine  However, if deterioration can 
be detected by human senses, damage may 
already be extensive  Using objective technologies, such as advanced vibration analysis, means damage can be detected before it 
becomes problematic (diagram 1)  By using 
condition-monitoring instruments and the 
SKF enveloped acceleration technology, the 
pre-warning time can be maximized 
An example of how damage can progress 
is shown in ig. 58 and shown conceptually 
in diagram 1   A damage scenario may follow this sequence: 
1 Bearing starts to show abrasive wear 
2 First spall, detected by SKF enveloped 
acceleration technology 
3 Spalling has developed to an extent that 
the damage can be detected by standard 
vibration monitoring 
4 Advanced spalling causes high vibration 
and noise levels and an increase in operating temperature 
5 Severe damage occurs: fatigue fracture of 
the bearing inner ring 
6 Catastrophic failure occurs with secondary 
damage to other components 
Monitoring noise and vibration
A common method used to try to identify 
deterioration or damage in a bearing is to 
listen  Bearings in good condition produce a 
soft purring noise  Grinding, squeaking and 
other irregular sounds usually indicate that 
the bearings are in poor condition, or that 
something is wrong  However, sound monitoring is of limited use  SKF recommends 
vibration monitoring  It is more thorough 
and allows better monitoring of bearings 
and rotating equipment 
Vibration monitoring is based on three 
fundamental facts:
• All machines vibrate 
• The onset of a mechanical problem is generally accompanied by an increase in 
vibration levels 
• The nature of the fault can be determined 
by analyzing the vibration characteristics 


Monitoring temperature
It is important to monitor the operating temperature at bearing positions  If the operating conditions have not been altered, a sudden increase in temperature is often an 
indication of developed bearing damage and 
possible imminent failure of the bearing  
However, keep in mind that a natural temperature rise can last up to one or two days 
immediately after irst machine start-up and 
after each relubrication when using grease 
Monitoring lubrication conditions
Bearings can only achieve maximum performance levels with adequate lubrication  The 
lubrication conditions of a bearing should 
therefore be monitored closely  The condition of the lubricant itself should also be 
assessed periodically, preferably by taking 
samples and having them analysed 
SKF recommends the following general 
guidelines for lubrication-related inspection 
activities:
• Check for lubricant leaks in the areas surrounding the bearing positions 
• Keep protective collars and labyrinth seals 
illed with grease for maximum protection 
• Check that automatic lubricating systems 
are functioning properly and providing the 
appropriate amount of lubricant to the 
• Check the lubricant level in sumps and 
reservoirs, and replenish as necessary 
• Where manual grease lubrication is 
employed, relubricate according to 
schedule 
• Where oil lubrication is used, change oil 
according to schedule 
• Always make sure that the speciied lubricant is used 
Inspection during a 
machine shutdown
When a machine is not in operation, it is an 
opportunity to assess the condition of bearings, seals, seal counterfaces, housings, and 
lubricant  A general inspection can often be 
done by removing a housing cover or cap  If 
a bearing appears to be damaged, it should 
be dismounted and thoroughly inspected 
Shaft and belt alignment, and a thorough 
inspection of the machine foundation and 
exterior, can also be done during a machine 
shutdown 
Any condition, whether it is a missing shim 
or a deteriorating foundation, can negatively 
affect machine performance  The sooner any 
problem is identiied, the sooner corrective 
action can begin  It is far less costly to replace 
bearings and associated components during 
a regularly scheduled shutdown than during 
unscheduled downtime that unexpectedly 
takes the machine out of service 
Inspecting bearings
Bearings are not always easily accessible  
However, when bearings are partially or fully 
exposed, visual checks can be made  The 
most practical time to inspect bearings is 
during routine maintenance 
When inspecting a mounted bearing, SKF 
recommends following these general 
guidelines:
• Preparation
 – Clean the external surface of the 
machine 
 – Remove the housing cover, or the housing cap, to expose the bearing 
 – Take lubricant samples for analysis  For 
oil lubrication, take samples from the 
sump/reservoir  For grease lubricated 
open bearings, take samples from various positions within the bearing and 
surroundings  Inspect the condition of 
the lubricant  Impurities can often be 
detected by spreading a thin layer of the 
lubricant on a sheet of paper and examining it under a light 
 – Clean the exposed external surfaces of 
the bearing with a lint-free cloth 
• Inspection
 – Inspect the exposed external surfaces of 
the bearing for corrosion  Inspect the 
bearing rings for any abnormal signs 
 – For sealed bearings, inspect the seals 
for wear or damage 
 – Where possible, rotate the shaft very 
slowly and feel for uneven resistance in 
the bearing; an undamaged bearing 
turns smoothly 
• Detailed inspection of grease lubricated 
Grease lubricated open bearings in split 
plummer blocks can be subjected to a 
more detailed in-situ inspection as 
follows:
 – Remove all grease around the bearing 
 – Remove as much grease from the bearing as possible using a non-metallic 
scraper 
 – Clean the bearing with a petroleum- 
based solvent by spraying the solvent 
into the bearing  Rotate the shaft very 
slowly while cleaning it, and continue to 
spray until the solvent ceases to collect 
dirt and grease  For large bearings that 
contain a build-up of severely oxidized 
lubricant, clean them with a strong 
alkaline solution containing up to 10% 
caustic soda and 1% wetting agent 
 – Dry the bearing, and surrounding parts, 
with a lint-free cloth or clean,  
moisture-free compressed air (but do 
not rotate or spin the bearing) 
 – Inspect the bearing raceways, cage(s) 
and rolling elements for spalls, marks, 
scratches, streaks, discolouration and 
mirror-like areas  Where applicable, 
measure the radial internal clearance of 
the bearing (to determine if wear has 
taken place) and conirm that it is within 
the expected range 
 – If the condition of the bearing is satisfactory, apply the appropriate grease to 
the bearing and the housing and immediately close the housing  If bearing 
damage is evident, dismount the bearing and protect it from corrosion  Then 
conduct a full analysis 


Inspection and monitoring
• General recommendations
 – Take photographs throughout the 
inspection process to help document the 
condition of the bearing, lubricant and 
machine in general 
 – Check the condition of the grease at 
different places and compare with fresh 
grease (ig. 59)  Keep a representative 
sample of the grease for further 
analysis 
 – Certain large and medium-size bearings 
are suitable for reconditioning  For additional information, refer to the SKF 
bearing maintenance handbook and 
publication SKF Remanufacturing 
Services 
Inspecting seal counterfaces
To be effective, a seal lip must run on a 
smooth counterface  If the counterface is 
worn or damaged, the seal lip will cease to 
function properly 
When inspecting the seal counterface, 
also check for corrosion, shaft wear, 
scratches, dents, lip wear, lip tears and so on  
If corrosion is evident but not severe, use a 
ine wet/dry abrasive paper to remove it, and 
then make sure all remnants are also 
removed  Worn counterface parts of the 
shaft can be repaired using SKF 
Speedi-Sleeve  

 WARNING
Avoid inhaling, ingesting or contacting 
solvents and alkaline solutions   These 
can cause skin and eye burns or damage to respiratory or digestive tract  If 
necessary, seek medical assistance

Troubleshooting
Bearings that are not operating properly 
usually exhibit identiiable symptoms  The 
best way to identify these symptoms, and 
take corrective action at an early stage, is to 
establish a plant-wide condition monitoring 
programme 
In cases where condition monitoring 
equipment is not available or practical, the 
section Troubleshooting of the SKF bearing 
maintenance handbook presents some useful hints to help identify the most common 
symptoms, their causes and, whenever possible, some practical solutions  Depending 
on the degree of bearing damage, some 
symptoms may be misleading and, in many 
cases, are the result of secondary damage  
To effectively troubleshoot bearing problems, it is necessary to analyse the symptoms according to those irst observed in the 
application  This is dealt with in more detail 
in the publication Bearing damage and failure analysis

This section contains several worked examples that show the Bearing selection process, 
page 60, applied to various machines and application cases 
Each example is presented as a number of steps that generally follows the sequence in the 
bearing selection process  However, interdependencies in any particular application case may 
require looping back and forth between the process steps and where this occurs it is fully 
described in the example

Vibrating screen
This example shows the bearing selection process applied to an 
application case in which a vibrating screen manufacturer is selecting 
the bearings for a new machine 
The steps in the example follow the sequence in the bearing se lection process  Refer to sections B.1 – B.8 for a full description of each 
process step  
Bearing type and 
A locating/non-locating bearing arrangement is used  The bearing 
on the drive side is the locating bearing  This limits axial displacement of the transmission pulley, which saves energy and increases 
belt life  The opposite bearing is non-locating to accommodate axial 
displacement caused by thermal expansion of the shaft  
The distance between the bearings is 3 metres, and the vibrating 
screen structure is made of welded and bolted steel parts. Shaft 
delection and misalignment of supports under load require bearings 
that can compensate for misalignment. 
Spherical roller bearings are selected for this new vibrating screen 
(ig. 2), which is the typical solution. They can carry high loads and 
accommodate misalignment between the inner and outer ring without any reduction of their service life.
Performance and operating 
The new machine is a free circular motion vibrating screen. The 
vibrator unit is composed of a shaft with two bearings and counterweights. This means the main radial load rotates with the shaft while 
the outer ring is stationary. The application drawing is shown in ig. 1. 
The relevant performance requirements, operating conditions and 
input parameters for the bearing selection are:
• mass of screen box without charge: G = 6 100 kg
• shaft diameter: 140 mm
• rotational speed: n = 756 r/min
• angular velocity (n × 2π/60): ω = 79,2 rad/s
• radius of vibration: r = 8,1 mm
• distance between the centres of gravity of the counterweights and 
shaft axis: R = 80 mm
• distance between the bearings: 3 m
• lubrication method: grease
• operating temperature of the bearings: T = 75 °C (165 °F)
• environment: the screen may be located outdoors, in harsh, dusty 
and humid conditions
• required SKF rating life: 20 000 h

Bearing size
Bearing size
A shaft diameter of 140 mm is needed to transmit the required shaft 
drive torque and limit shaft delection. 
SKF supplies bearings in the 223 series for vibratory applications. 
Based on the required shaft diameter, the 22328 CCJA/W33VA405 
is selected. We will check its size using the SKF rating life. 
Product data for 22328 CCJA/W33VA405 is on page 800. 
For vibrating screens, the equivalent dynamic bearing load, P, can 
be estimated using:

1. Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, κ
κ = ν/ν1 
The rated viscosity ν1 = 10 mm2/s (diagram 14, page 101).
A viscosity ratio, κ, of about 4 is targeted to operate in full ilm 
lubrication conditions, therefore ν should be about 40 mm2/s. 
You need to verify the viscosity ratio after you have selected your 
lubricant. 
2. Contamination factor, ηc
• contamination conditions are typical (i.e. open bearings, no iltering, wear particles and ingress from surrounding and harsh 
environment)
• dm = 220 mm

Conclusion
SKF bearing 22328 CCJA/W33VA405 is a suitable size to meet the 
rating life requirements.
Selecting grease or oil
On page 113, table 1 provides limits for the ndm value, up to which 
grease lubrication is normally a suitable solution in terms of relubrication intervals at normal temperatures.
Input values: 
• spherical roller bearing in the 223 series
• C/P = 7,3
• n dm = 756 × (140 + 300)/2 = 166 320
From table 1, page 113, the recommended ndm limit for C/P ≈ 8 is 
150 000, which is somewhat below the actual ndm value. The operating conditions are at the limits where grease lubrication is suitable, 
and you can expect short relubrication intervals. But this is not an 
issue for vibrating screens, and you can select grease lubrication. 
Grease selection
You can ind a suitable SKF grease using the SKF bearing grease 
selection chart, page 124. Grease selection criteria are:
• temperature: 75 °C (165 °F) → M
• speed: n dm ≈ 166 000 → M to H
• load: C/P ≈ 8 → M
• severe vibrations
• humid outdoor conditions → good rust inhibiting properties
SKF LGEP2 is a suitable choice provided a viscosity ratio, κ, of 4 is 
conirmed. 
LGEP2 has the following properties:
• ν = 200 mm2/s at 40 °C (105 °F)
• ν = 16 mm2/s at 100 °C (210 °F)
• operating viscosity at 75 °C (165 °F) is around 40 mm2/s, based on 
diagram 13, page 100.
• κ = ν/ν1= 40/10 = 4 is conirmed
Relubrication interval and quantity
Experience suggests relubricating the bearings in the vibrating 
screen every 75 h with 30 g of grease. The short intervals are needed 
to push out contamination, while the reduced quantity limits heat 
generation caused by high grease volumes. 
Using the standard relubrication interval from diagram 2, 
page 112, and input values gives:
• n dm bf = 166 320 × 2 ≈ 330 000
• C/P ≈ 8
The relubrication interval is 1 700 h. This needs to be reduced, with 
contamination and vibration considered (table 2, page 115), conirming approximately the experienced values used for vibrating 
screen bearings. 
Relubrication quantity is: 
Gp = 0,002 D B = 0,002 × 300 × 102 = 61 g 
Standard relubrication of the bearings every 75 h with 30 g of grease 
will maintain adequate lubrication condition. 
Initial grease ill
The free volume in the bearing, which should be illed with grease, is 
approximately:

π 
V = J B (D2 – d2) × 10–3 – J J J J

7,8 × 10–3
V = 3,14/4 × 102 × (3002 – 1402) × 10-3 – 36,5/0,0078 = 957 cm3 
For a illing degree of 50%, you need about 430 g of grease per 
bearing.
C.1 Vibrating screen


and speed
Experience from similar applications is broad and a bearing operating 
temperature between 70 to 80 °C (160 to 175 °F) can be assumed. 
The screen charge is at ambient temperature and there are no 
other external sources generating heat. The speed is < 50% of the 
limiting speed. Although the load ratio C/P < 10, no detailed thermal 
analysis is required. 
The actual operating temperature should be checked on the real 
machine. 
The bearing frictional losses are 1 900 W per bearing, calculated 
with the SKF Bearing Calculator (skf.com/bearingcalculator).
The radial load turns in phase with the rotating inner ring, while the 
outer ring stands still. Therefore, the inner ring has a stationary load 
condition and the outer ring a rotating load condition. An interference it is needed between the outer ring and the housing. A loose it 
can be used between the inner ring and the shaft. 
The standard it recommendations are listed in table 1. 
There are reasons for choosing dimensional tolerances other than 
the standard its:
• Choose f6 for easy axial displacement of the inner ring. To 
reduce the risk of fretting corrosion, consider hardening the shaft 
seat.
• Select P6 (tighter tolerances) to improve outer ring support and 
bearing service life.
Additional recommendations
The following additional factors are recommended:
• The bearing centre should be aligned with the frame centre of the 
vibrating screen (ig. 3).
• The housing wall thickness should be greater than 40% of the 
bearing width.
• Design the housing to be as symmetrical as possible, so it has the 
same thickness on both sides of the vibrating screen frame, in 
order to avoid housing deformation (ig. 4).
• Machine threads in the housing to make it easier when dismounting the housing from the screen body and the bearing of the housing by the use of bolts (ig. 5 and ig. 6, page 220).

Bearing execution
The bearing selected for this application is a spherical roller bearing 
for vibratory applications (Designs and variants page 775). 
These bearings are identiied by the designation sufixes VA405 
and VA406. They have a C4 internal clearance, which is required 
because of the interference it of the outer ring in combination with 
the temperature difference between inner and outer rings, particularly during start-up situations. Their hardened window-type cages 
reduce friction and wear in the bearing when operating under rotating outer ring load and high acceleration conditions, resulting in a 
lower operating temperature and longer lubricant life. 
The VA406 execution is intended for the non-locating support and 
has a PTFE coated bore. This helps to prevent fretting corrosion, 
which can occur because of the loose it and vibration.
Vibrating screen designs generally use labyrinth seals to protect the 
rolling bearings. With this type of seal, it is important to maintain a 
suficient quantity of grease in the labyrinth gaps so that dirt and 
moisture are kept away from the bearings. Quantities and relubrication 
intervals should be adjusted according to the operator's observations. 
Check the total radial run-out of the housing seat when the housing 
is mounted to the screen frame. Inadmissible deformation might 
occur and can require corrective action.

Rope sheave

This example shows the bearing selection process applied to an 
application case in which bearings are to be selected for the rope 
sheaves on a new paper machine  
A paper machine manufacturer wants to build a new machine 
using rope sheaves of their standard design  The end customer 
requires the sheaves to be maintenance free for ive years. 
The steps in the example follow the sequence in the bearing selection process. Some steps, such as Bearing size, require more than 
one iteration if the calculation is dependent on a subsequent stage in 
the process. This is indicated in the heading (for example, Bearing 
size (step 2), page 224). Refer to sections B.1 – B.8 for a full description of each process step. 
Performance and operating 
The rope sheaves (ig. 1) are positioned between rolls/cylinders of 
the paper machine and rotate all the time that the machine is in 
operation. In this application the outer ring of each rope sheave 
rotates continuously. The operating conditions are:
• rotational speed: 2 450 r/min
• radial load: 1,1 kN created by the weight of the sheave and by the 
rope tension, shared between the bearings
• axial load: zero – because of the orientation of the sheaves, the 
rope creates no axial load
• environment: hot and humid, with 80 °C (175 °F) ambient 
Bearing type and 
Because loads are low and speeds moderate, rope sheaves use two 
deep groove ball bearings. For a long, maintenance-free period 
sealed bearings are required. SKF deep groove ball bearings are 
available with various seal executions. 
A loating bearing arrangement is used, where each bearing 
locates the sheave axially in one direction and the whole arrangement is able to move axially over a small distance between the two 
end positions.

Lubrication (step 2)
Bearing size
The manufacturer’s existing rope sheave design uses two 
6207-2RS1 bearings. SKF has replaced the RS1 seal with the RSH 
seal. In this example we check the suitability of 6207-2RSH bearings 
(page 274). 
The next step in the selection process is to determine the method, 
on which to base the size selection. The bearings are running in typical operating conditions and, therefore, rolling contact fatigue is the 
probable failure mode. We base the size selection on rating life.
Basic rating life

⎛ 106 w ⎛ C wp
L10h =  J J    J 

⎝  60 n ⎠ ⎝ P ⎠
As there is no axial load, the equivalent dynamic bearing load, P, on 
each bearing is equal to the radial load divided by two.
• P = 0,55 kN
• load ratio C/P = 49
The basic rating life L10h = 804 800 h. This is much longer than the 
required maintenance-free period of 5 years (43 800 h). 
Conclusion 
• With such a high basic rating life at 2 450 r/min, it is recommended 
to check that the bearing is suficiently loaded to maintain ball rolling and avoid ball sliding. This will be done after the lubrication is 
checked, because lubricant viscosity inluences the requisite minimum load.
• Grease life should be checked to see if the bearing fulils the 
end-customer’s requirement.
The SKF rating life, L10mh, will be calculated after the lubrication is 
checked and the operating temperature and speed are checked, 
because lubricant viscosity inluences the result. This will be done in 
Bearing size (step 2), page 224. 
Bearing 6207-2RSH is illed with MT33 grease (table 2, page 245). 
The operating temperature should be deined before continuing.
Operating temperature and 
When the load ratio C/P > 10, the operating temperature is below 
100 °C (210 °F), the operating speed is below 50% of the limiting 
speed, and there is no pronounced external heat input, a detailed 
thermal analysis is not required. In this example: 
• load ratio: C/P = 49 > 10 
• operating speed: 2 450 r/min < 0,5 × 6 300 (limiting speed)
• From experience of rope sheaves operating in similar conditions, 
the bearing operating temperature is about 90 °C (195 °F).
So a detailed thermal analysis is not required.
Lubrication (step 2)
1. Grease life MT33 
Grease life can be estimated using diagram 1, page 246. Because 
the bearing outer ring rotates, for grease life estimations, nD is used 
instead of ndm (table 2, page 115).
Then, using the input values:
• nD = 2 450 × 72 = 176 400
• MT33 grease with a grease performance factor, GPF = 1
• operating temperature of about 90 °C (195 °F)
The grease life, L10h, is about 12 500 hours, which is less than the 
required 5-year maintenance-free period. 
2. Grease life WT
The SKF bearing 6207-2RSH is available with the grease WT, which 
has a GPF = 4. It is a polyurea-type grease with an ester base oil, 
table 3, page 245. 
From diagram 1, page 246 the grease life, L10h, is 50 000 hours, 
which is greater than 5 years.
Conclusion
The SKF bearing 6207-2RSH with the grease WT fulils the requirement in terms of grease life.

Bearing size (step 2)
From the conclusions in Bearing size, page 223, the minimum load 
needs to be checked and, now the lubrication has been selected, the 
SKF rating life can be veriied.  
Using the minimum load equation from Loads, page 254, the minimum load, Frm, is given by: 
  q ν n w2/3 q dm w 2
Frm = kr   –––––  
 ——
  < 1 000 z  < 100 z
where:
kr = 0,025
ν = 210 mm2/s
When determining the minimum load, to cover all critical operating conditions, use the highest oil viscosity that might occur. 
This will be at the lowest temperature, which is 20 °C (70 °F). 
Base oil viscosity of WT grease at 40 °C (105 °F) is 70 mm2/s ≈ 
ISO VG 68. Estimated from diagram 13, page 100, or calculated with the SKF Bearing Calculator 
(skf.com/bearingcalculator), for WT grease ν = 210 mm2/s at 
20 °C (70 °F).
dm = (d+D)/2 = (35+72)/2 = 53,5 mm
Therefore: 
Frm =  0,44 kN < 0,55 kN, so the bearing 6207-2RSH/WT is 
adequate.
SKF rating life
L10mh = aSKF L10h
Because P < Pu, fatigue is not a factor (Fatigue load limit, Pu, 
page 104). However, it is useful to verify the lubrication condition 
(viscosity ratio) and life modiication factor.  
1. Lubrication condition – the viscosity ratio, κ
κ = ν/ν1 
The following are used:
• ν1 is determined from diagram 14, page 101
• with dm = 53,5 and n = 2 450 r/min, ν1 is close to 12 mm2/s
For WT, the base oil viscosity at 90 °C (195 °F) can be estimated from 
diagram 13, page 100, or calculated with the SKF Bearing Calculator 
(skf.com/bearingcalculator) and is 12 mm2/s. 
Viscosity ratio, κ = 12/12 = 1  
2. Life modiication factor, aSKF
To determine the life modiication factor for radial ball bearings, 
diagram 9, page 96 is used, with:
• P = 0,55 kN
• κ = 1
• Pu = 0,655 kN
• ηc = 0,6
The contamination factor is chosen based on table 6, page 105.
• SKF 6207-2RSH/WT is an SKF Explorer bearing.
With ηcPu/P = 0,7 and using diagram 9, page 96, the aSKF of about 
50 is much greater than 1, so the SKF rating life is far above the 
required life. 
Conclusion
The bearing SKF 6207-2RSH/WT is adequate in terms of fatigue 
life.

Bearing execution
The bearing inner rings have a stationary load condition and no 
spacer between the inner rings in the cross-located arrangement  
They are mounted with a loose it for easy mounting. The recommended it for standard conditions is g6 (table 5, page 148). 
The outer rings have a rotating load condition, so they are 
mounted with an interference. The recommended it for standard 
conditions is M7 (table 8, page 151), which has a prob able interference range of –25 to +8 (table 20, page 172). 
Bearings in rope sheaves of paper machines should always have 
an interference for the outer ring (application handbook Rolling bearings in paper machines). To achieve this select N6, which has a 
probable interference range of –29 to –5 (table 21, page 174). For 
geometrical tolerances and surface roughness, standard recommendations can be applied.

C.2 Rope sheave


It is not recommended to use shields (sufix 2Z) instead of contact 
seals (sufix 2RSH) in this application because there is a risk of 
grease leakage with outer ring rotation. The 2RSH seal design has 
the advantage of being more resistant to washout (high-pressure 
cleaning) that happens in paper machines, and so this will increase 
service life. 
Consider hybrid bearings
Depending on the paper machine and position of the rope sheave, 
the sheave may face higher operating temperatures, which will 
reduce the grease life. To increase grease life, the use of hybrid bearings (ceramic balls instead of steel ones) of the same size can 
increase the grease life by at least a factor of two. 
Consider design change
By changing the rope sheave hub design so that the bearing’s inner 
ring rotates instead of the outer ring, grease life is increased. The 
speed factor will be n dm = 131 000 instead of nD = 176 400. 
The grease life, L10h, of the 6207-2RSH/C3WT bearing will 
increase from 50 000 h to 61 000 h. 
SKF has developed a rope sheave hub to take the above consideration into account. The bearings have ceramic balls, and WT grease, 
and their inner rings rotate (ig. 2). An enhanced design has been 
created using special bearings. For additional information, see the 
handbook Rolling bearings in paper machines.
SKF rope sheave hub
Sometimes, simple labyrinth seals are added to protect the bearing 
integral seals further. 
The normal mounting and dismounting methods are applicable.
Overall conclusions
The bearing that fulils the requirements is a sealed and greased 
SKF Explorer bearing 6207-2RSH/C3WT. 
For more demanding operating conditions, or to achieve an even 
longer maintenance-free period, SKF can provide other solutions.

Centrifugal pump

This example shows the bearing selection process applied to an 
application case in which modiication is required to a centrifugal 
pump. 
The pump manufacturer wants to improve the eficiency of an 
existing centrifugal process pump by modifying the impeller. As a 
result, the bearing loads will be greater, and so the current bearing 
selection needs to be checked to verify that it can cope with the 
change. The application drawing is shown in ig. 1. 
The steps in the example follow the sequence in the bearing selection process. Refer to sections B.1 – B.8 for a full description of each 
process step. 
Performance and operating

back-to-back: 
 – max. radial load: Fr = 1,45kN
 – max. axial load: Fa = 11,5 kN
 – estimated operating temperature: T = 85 °C (185 °F)
Following pump industry standards, the basic rating life L10h should 
be at least 16 000 h at maximum load conditions.
Bearing type and 
A cylindrical roller bearing is used as the non-locating support and a 
pair of universally matchable single row angular contact ball bearings 
are used as the locating support. 
The cylindrical roller bearing, of type NU, is used for the following 
reasons: 
• It can accommodate, within itself, thermal expansion of the shaft.
• The inner ring is separable from the outer ring, with rollers and 
cage – this simpliies assembly of the pump and the use of interference its on both inner and outer ring.
For the pair of universally matchable single row angular contact ball 
bearings:
• Ball bearings with a 40° angle are well suited to accommodate 
high axial loads and medium to high speeds.
• The bearings are arranged back-to-back, with the inner rings 
clamped and mounted with an interference it to the shaft. 
Because the clearance of the pair is controlled by clamping the 
inner rings, the outer rings can be positioned in the housing 
between a shoulder and a cover, without the need for precise 
clamping.
Both bearing housing seats are machined in one clamping position, 
which guarantees good alignment. Misalignment is less than 2 minutes of arc, which is within the acceptable misalignment limits for the 
angular contact ball bearing pair and cylindrical roller bearing. 
Conclusion
The current selection of bearing type and arrangement is adequate 
for this application. 
Bearing size, non-locating 
support
The given operating conditions, and the effects of rolling contact 
fatigue, indicate that bearing size should be determined using the 
basic rating life and SKF rating life.

then L10mh >> 1 000 000 h indicating that the bearing is oversized 
for the operating conditions. 
The fact that the basic rating life and SKF rating life are both very 
high and above the required bearing life indicates that the bearing 
may be too lightly loaded.

minimum radial load, Frm, required to avoid skidding and roller slip 
for cylindrical roller bearings is given by:

n = 3 000 r/min
nr = 6 000 r/min
then Frm = 0,94 kN < Fr = 3,29 kN
Conclusion
The bearing is oversized / lightly loaded. Options are:
• Continue to use the current bearing. There is no risk that the bearing 
will be damaged due to being too lightly loaded.
• Downsize the bearing, and in so doing reduce cost. Consider one of 
the following:
 – Keep the shaft diameter the same, but use the smaller NU 2 
series bearing NU 211 ECP (refer to the product section).
 – Reduce the shaft diameter one step, provided the shaft design 
permits (strength and stiffness), and use the smaller NU 2 series

Bearing size, locating

The given operating conditions, and the effects of rolling contact 
fatigue, indicate that bearing size should be determined using the 
basic rating life and SKF rating life.

From Loads, page 398:

From Loads, page 398, for bearing pairs arranged back-to-back: 
Fa/Fr = 11,5/1,45 > 1,14 
So use: 
P = 0,57 Fr + 0,93 Fa = (0,57 × 1,45) + (0,93 × 11,5) = 11,52 kN 
Therefore, the load ratio C/P = 168,5/11,52 = 14,6

then, using diagram 13, page 100, ν = 13 mm2/s 
n = 3 000 r/min
dm = 0,5 (60 + 130) = 95 mm
then, using diagram 14, page 101, ν1 = 7 mm2/s 
Therefore, κ = 13/7 = 1,8

The next higher viscosity grade, ISO VG 100, would give κ = 2,5. But 
this would result in the NU 311 ECP bearing having κ > 4, which, during cold starts in particular, would give unwanted high κ values. 
2. Contamination factor, ηc

Conclusion
The pair of 7312 BECBP SKF Explorer bearings are of a suitable size.
The pump has an oil bath. This is typical of process pumps, because 
of their requirement for long service intervals. In this pump, for simplicity, the locating and the non-locating support bearings are lubricated by the same oil bath. 
As determined in previous steps, κ is 1,8 for the pair of angular 
contact ball bearings and 2,8 for the cylindrical roller bearing, and so 
the viscosity grade of the selected oil is adequate. 
Operating temperature and 
Determine whether a detailed thermal analysis is required (Thermal 
equilibrium, page 131) by checking that:
• the rotational speed is less than 50% of the bearing limiting speed:
 – This is true for the non-locating support.
 – For the locating support, it is 56%, which is just slightly above the 
limit. That is, for a pair of single row angular contact ball bearings, the limiting speed is reduced by 20% (Permissible speed, 
page 402), and so 3 000/(0,8 × 6 700) = 0,56.
• the load ratio C/P > 10:
 – This is true for the locating and non-locating supports.
• there is no pronounced external heat input:
 – The pump is located in an environment where the ambient temperature is 20 to 30 °C (70 to 85 °F).
 – The pump medium is at ambient temperature, so no additional 
heat lows to the bearings.
Therefore, no further thermal analysis is needed.
Because the loads on the bearings will be greater, as a result of the 
modiication to the pump, you should check the bearing seat tolerances to make sure the bearings are mounted with adequate its. 
Given the standard steel shaft and cast iron housing, the bearing 
loads, speeds and temperatures, which are all within standard conditions, you can apply Seat tolerances for standard conditions, 
page 148.  
Shaft tolerances
You can ind shaft tolerances for seats for radial ball bearings in 
table 5, page 148, and for radial roller bearings in table 6,

The current design has adequate axial location. Make sure that the 
lock nut that locates the inner rings of the angular contact ball bearings is suficiently tightened. Apply the clamp force uniformly around 
the circumference and respect the abutment dimensions (product 
data for 7312 BECBP is on page 414). To avoid distortion of the inner 
rings and to achieve the desired axial clearance in the bearing pair, 
limit the clamping force. For centrifugal pumps, a clamping force of 
C0/4 (19 kN) is recommended.

Checking the initial internal clearance
The current design uses bearings with Normal initial clearance. The 
its for the inner and outer rings, and a temperature difference 
between the inner and outer rings of 10 °C (20 °F), reduce the intern- 
al clearance. Other inluences on the internal clearance are 
negligible.

4. Operating clearance 
For a cylindrical roller bearing, negative clearance (i.e. preload) is 
generally not recommended. 
Pairs of angular contact ball bearings should have an average 
operating clearance close to zero (ranging between small clearance 
and light preload), particularly when the pairs are loaded predominantly axially. A small range is required to:
• limit preload – to limit friction (increased friction results in higher 
temperatures, and therefore reduced viscosity and reduced bearing life)
• limit clearance – to avoid ball skidding
This manual calculation does not consider smoothing of the mating 
surfaces, nor elastic delection under load, nor the probability of 
extreme values occurring at the same time. 
Analysis using more advanced SKF software gives operating clearance results: 
These results indicate that Normal internal clearance is suitable.
Cage selection
Given the estimated operating temperature of 85 °C (185 °F) (i.e. the 
higher temperature of the two bearing supports), a speed of well 
below the limiting speed, and considering availability and price, the 
standard rolling element guided polyamide cages are conirmed as 
adequate  
For historical reasons, in some geographical areas, brass cages are 
preferred for angular contact ball bearings  These are available as 
standard from SKF  This also applies to the cylindrical roller bearings

Overall conclusions
Sealing
The current pump design uses radial shaft seals to keep the oil bath 
lubricant in the pump and to protect the bearings from contamination (ig. 1, page 228). You can use seals SKF HMS5 (ig. 2) or 
HMSA10 (ig. 3). These are suitable for both oil and grease lubricated 
applications. The temperature range and speed capability of the 
nitrile rubber compound used for these seals suits the operating 
conditions of the pump. 
When the seal counterface becomes worn, you can repair the 
shaft with a wear sleeve, such as SKF Speedi-Sleeve. 
Hot mounting of the bearings
The bearings are mounted with an interference it on the shaft and a 
transition it in their housings. You can mount the bearings easily by 
heating their inner rings to 100 °C (210 °F) and the housing seats to 
50 °C (160 °F). For heating the inner rings, use an SKF induction 
heater or electric hot plate. 
Shaft alignment
To maximize pump life, the pump and its electric motor need to be 
well aligned. SKF alignment tools can help. 
Overall conclusions
The existing bearings can be used in combination with the new 
impeller design. 
Downsizing of the cylindrical roller bearing is recommended.

Deep groove ball bearings are particularly 
versatile. They are suitable for high and very 
high speeds, accommodate radial and axial 
loads in both directions, and require little 
maintenance. Because deep groove ball 
bearings are the most widely used bearing 
type, they are available from SKF in many 
designs, variants and sizes.

Single row bearing 
Single row deep 
groove ball bearings
Single row deep groove ball bearings (ig. 1) 
are available capped (with seals or shields) 
or open. Open bearings that are also available capped may have recesses in the ring 
side faces (ig. 2). 
SKF inch bearings in the EE(B), RLS and 
RMS series are intended as aftermarket 
items and, therefore, SKF recommends not 
using these bearings for new bearing 
arrangement designs (skf.com/go/17000-1-1).
SKF can also supply bearings with a 
tapered bore. For detailed information, 
 contact SKF.
Stainless steel deep 
groove ball bearings
Stainless steel deep groove ball bearings 
(ig. 1) are available capped (with seals or 
shields) or open. Open bearings that are also 
available capped may have recesses in the 
ring side faces (ig. 2).
These bearings have a lower load carrying 
capacity than same-sized bearings made of 
high chromium steel.
Inch stainless steel deep groove ball bearings are not listed in this catalogue, but can 
be found online at skf.com/go/17000-1-4 
Single row deep 
groove ball bearings 
with ﬁlling slots
Single row deep groove ball bearings with 
illing slots have a illing slot in both the inner 
and outer rings (ig. 3) to accommodate 
more balls than standard deep groove ball 
Filling slot bearings have a higher radial 
load carrying capacity than bearings without 
illing slots, but their axial load carrying 
capacity is limited  They are also unable to 
operate at the same high speeds as bearings 
without illing slots 
Deep groove ball bearings with illing slots 
are available open or with shields on one or 
both sides  They are also available with or 
without a snap ring groove  Open bearings 
that are also available with shields may have 
recesses in the outer ring (ig. 4) 
Large size deep groove ball bearings with

Double row deep 
groove ball bearings
Double row deep groove ball bearings (ig. 5) 
are very suitable for bearing arrangements 
where the load carrying capacity of a single 
row bearing is inadequate. For the same 
bore and outside diameter, double row bearings are slightly wider than single row bearings in the 62 and 63 series, but have a considerably higher load carrying capacity 
Double row deep groove ball bearings are 
only available as open bearings (without 
seals or shields) 
Capped bearings
Selection guidelines for different capping 
devices under various operating conditions 
are listed in table 1  However, these guidelines cannot substitute for testing a shield or 
seal in its application  For additional information, refer to Integral sealing, page 26 
The seals, which are itted in a recess on 
the outer ring, make good, positive contact

1 Deep groove ball bearings
Grease life for capped bearings
• is presented as L10, i.e. the time period at 
the end of which 90% of the bearings are 
still reliably lubricated (diagram 1)
• depends on:
 – the operating temperature
 – the speed factor, ndm
 – grease performance factor (GPF) 
(table 3, page 245)
The indicated grease life is valid under this 
combination of operating conditions:
• horizontal shaft
• inner ring rotation
• light load (P ≤ 0,05 C)
• operating temperature within the green 
temperature zone of the grease (table 3)
• stationary machine
• low vibration levels
Where the operating conditions differ as 
described below, the grease life obtained 
from the diagram should be adjusted:
• for vertical shafts, use 50% of the obtained 
value
• for heavier loads (P > 0,05 C), apply a 
reduction factor (table 4)
When capped bearings must operate under 
certain extreme conditions, such as very 
high speeds or high temperatures, grease 
may appear on the capping diameter. For 
bearing arrangements where this would be 
detrimental, appropriate actions could be 
taken. For additional information, contact 
the SKF application engineering service.

Bearings with a snap 
ring groove
• can simplify the design of an arrangement
 – by locating the bearing axially in the 
housing by a snap ring (ig. 12)
 – by saving space
 – by signiicantly reducing mounting time 
Appropriate snap rings are shown in the 
product table along with their designation 
and dimensions 
The following variants are available 
(ig. 13):
• open bearings with a snap ring groove 
only (designation sufix N)
• open bearings with a snap ring (designa­
tion sufix NR)
• bearings with a snap ring and a shield on 
the opposite side (designation sufix ZNR)
• bearings with a snap ring and a shield on 
the same side (designation sufix ZNBR)
• bearings with a snap ring and a shield on 
both sides (designation sufix 2ZNR)
Bearings with a 
langed outer ring
Certain sizes of SKF stainless steel deep 
groove ball bearings are also available with a 
lange on the outer ring (designation sufix R, 
ig. 14)  They: 
• can be supplied open or capped
• are relatively easy to locate axially in the 
housing
• enable easier and more cost­effective 
housing bore manufacture, no shoulders 
required
These bearings with a langed outer ring are 
not listed in this catalogue, but can be found

Matched pairs can be supplied in three 
different arrangements (ig. 16): 
Tandem arrangement (designation 
sufix DT)
• is used where the load carrying capacity of 
a single bearing is inadequate
• has parallel load lines and therefore 
shares the radial and axial loads equally
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
Back-to-back arrangement (designation 
sufix DB)
• has load lines that diverge towards the 
bearing axis
• provides a relatively stiff bearing 
• can accommodate tilting moments
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
directions, but only by one bearing in each 
Face-to-face arrangement (designation 
sufix DF)
• has load lines that converge towards the 
bearing axis
• is less sensitive to misalignment but not as 
stiff as a back­to­back arrangement
• can accommodate axial loads in both

Insert bearings (SKF Y-bearings) are based 
on sealed deep groove ball bearings in the 
62 and 63 series, but have a convex outer 
ring and in most cases an extended inner 
ring with a speciic locking device (ig. 1), 
enabling quick and easy mounting onto the 
shaft 
• Quick and easy to mount
The different locking methods enable 
quick and easy mounting of insert bearings onto the shaft 
• Accommodate initial misalignment
The spherically shaped outside surface 
enables initial misalignment by tilting in 
the housing (ig. 2) 
The different sealing solutions available 
provide a long service life for a wide variety 
of applications with high contamination 
levels  
• Reduced noise and vibration levels
Where high requirements on noise and 
vibration levels are important, SKF can 
provide the appropriate shaft locking 
method

Typical applications
Because of their versatility and cost- 
effectiveness, insert bearings are typically 
used in the following applications:
• Agricultural machinery
• Food and beverage processing and 
packaging
• Conveyor systems
• Material handling systems
• Textile equipment
• Industrial fans
• Special machinery, e g  car wash systems, 
gym equipment, go-karts
Ball bearing units (Y-bearing 
units)
SKF also supplies a wide variety of ball bearing 
units that are not listed in this rolling bearing 
catalogue  For information about ball bearing 
units, refer to the product information available online at skf com/bearings

Insert bearings typically have a spherically 
shaped (convex) outside surface and an 
extended inner ring (ig. 3) with different 
types of locking device  The various insert 
bearing series differ in the way the bearing is 
locked onto the shaft:
• with grub (set) screws (ig. 4)
• with an eccentric locking collar (ig. 5)
• with SKF ConCentra locking technology 
(ig. 6)
• with an adapter sleeve (ig. 7)
• with an interference it (ig. 8)
Insert bearings with an inner ring that is 
extended on both sides run more smoothly, 
as the extent to which the inner ring can tilt 
on the shaft is reduced.
The standard SKF insert bearing assortment presented in this section also includes 
application-speciic variants, such as:
• bearings made of stainless steel or with 
zinc-coated rings for the food industry

Sealing solutions
SKF supplies all insert bearings capped with 
a seal or shield on both sides  In typical 
insert bearing applications, no additional 
external protection is necessary  Therefore, 
insert bearings are available with several 
sealing arrangement designs to meet the 
demands of a wide range of operating 
When capped bearings must operate 
under certain conditions, such as very high 
speeds or high temperatures, grease may 
appear between the inner ring and capping 
device  For bearing arrangements where this 
would be detrimental, appropriate actions 
should be taken 
Standard seals 
• consist of a stamped sheet steel washer 
with a seal lip made of NBR, vulcanized to 
its inner surface (ig. 20, designation sufix 
VP274 for bearings with a standard inner 
ring and no designation sufix for other 
insert bearings)
• form, with its non-contact sheet steel 
washer, a narrow gap with the inner ring 
shoulder to protect the seal against coarse 
contaminants
Standard seals with 
additional lingers
• are recommended for the more contaminated environments
• consist of a a standard seal and an additional sheet steel or stainless sheet steel 
plain linger (ig. 21, designation sufix 2F)
• have an interference it for the linger on 
the inner ring shoulder to improve considerably the effectiveness of the seal without 
increasing friction

inner ring extended on both sides
5-lip seals
• are recommended for extremely contaminated environments, such as agricultural 
• are patented by SKF
• consist of a sheet steel insert with a 
 vulcanized 5-lip contact seal made of a 
low-friction NBR compound (ig. 23):
 – The steel insert is held in place by a 
groove in the bearing outer ring and 
protects the seal from solid 
contaminants 
 – Each seal lip has a different design to 
provide superior sealing performance in 
response to different operating conditions, including dynamic misalignment 
 – The outermost and innermost lips act as 
a labyrinth to prevent contaminant 
ingress and grease leakage, 
respectively 
 – The three inner lips make constant 
 contact with the inner ring shoulder 
• are only available for bearings with an 
inner ring extended on both sides
RS1 seals
• were originally developed for standard 
SKF deep groove ball bearings

SKF insert bearings are supplied capped on 
both sides and are greased 
Greases for capped 
Insert bearings are illed with one of the 
 following greases (table 2):
• zinc-coated and stainless steel insert 
† food-grade grease GFJ, registered by 
NSF as category H1
The NSF registration conirms the 
grease fulils the requirements listed in the 
US Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines under 21 CFR section 178 3570 
(lubricant acceptable with incidental food 
contact, for use in and around food processing areas) 
• all other insert bearings
† standard grease VT307
Grease life for insert 
• is presented as L10, i e  the time period at 
the end of which 90% of the bearings are 
still reliably lubricated
• depends on the load, operating temperature and the ndm value (diagram 1)
The indicated grease life is valid for the following combination of operating conditions:
• horizontal shaft
• very light to moderate loads (P ≤ 0,05 C)
• stationary machine
• low vibration levels
Where the operating conditions vary, the 
grease life obtained from the diagram should 
be adjusted as follows:
• vertical shafts † 50% of the obtained value
• heavier loads (P > 0,05 C) † apply reduction 
factor (table 4)
The values for adjusting the grease life are 
estimates  Vibration can have a negative 
inluence on grease life  The extent cannot 
be quantiied, and the inluence increases 
with increasing operating temperature 
Relubrication
Insert bearings do not need relubrication if 
the grease life exceeds the SKF rating life, 
page 89 of the bearing 
Relubrication can extend bearing service 
life under any of the following conditions:
• The bearings are exposed to high humidity 
or severe contamination 
• The bearings accommodate normal or 
heavy loads 
• The bearings operate for extended periods 
at high speeds or at temperatures above 
55 °C (130 °F) 
• The bearings are subjected to high vibration 
levels 
To relubricate insert bearings, the following 
greases can be used:
• zinc-coated and stainless steel insert 
† food-grade grease SKF LGFP 2
• all other insert bearings
† SKF LGWA 2, LGMT 2 or LGMT 3 grease

If relubrication is needed, the relubrication 
intervals can be estimated by following the 
method explained under Estimating the relubrication interval for grease, page 111 
When relubricating, the shaft should be 
turned and the grease pumped slowly until 
fresh grease starts to escape from the 
seal(s)  Excessive pressure from pumping 
too quickly can damage the seals  When 
machines and equipment are used for a 
 limited period of time, SKF recommends 
relubricating each bearing at the end of the 
operational period, i e  immediately before 
being laid up 
Relubrication features
SKF insert bearings are designed to facilitate 
relubrication  They have two lubrication 
holes in the outer ring as standard, one on 
each side, positioned 120° apart  Bearings 
without lubrication holes can be supplied on 
request (designation sufix W) 
The following bearings do not have the 
standard relubrication features:
• Stainless steel insert bearings with grub 
screws have a lubrication groove in the 
outer ring located on the side opposite the 
locking device and one lubrication hole 
within this groove 
• Insert bearings with a standard inner ring 
without designation sufix B and insert 
bearings with 5-lip seals are lubricated for 
life and cannot be relubricated  They do 
not have any lubrication holes

insert bearings can be limited by: 
rings and balls
Bearing rings and balls
SKF insert bearings are heat stabilized up to 
at least 150 °C (300 °F) 
For temperature limits of PA66 cages, refer 
to Polymer cages, page 188 
NBR seals is –40 to +100 °C (–40 to 
+210 °F)  Temperatures up to 120 °C 
(250 °F) can be tolerated for brief periods 
Typically, temperature peaks are at the 
seal lip 
Temperature limits for the greases used in 
SKF insert bearings are provided in table 2, 
page 348  For temperature limits of other 
SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable 
SKF grease, page 116 
Insert bearings should not operate at speeds 
above the limiting speed listed in the product tables, page 366  This speed limit is set 
by the seal design 
For insert bearings with grub screws or an 
eccentric locking collar, the permissible speed 
is also inluenced by the shaft tolerance  
Where using these bearings on shafts with 
tolerances other than h6, compare the speed 
values listed in the product tables with those 
in table 9  The lower value is the permissible

1) For example, bearing size 06 includes all bearings based on a 206 insert bearing, such as YAR 206-2F, YAR 206-101-2F, 
YAR 206-102-2F, YAR 206-103-2F, YAR 206-104-2F 
The permissible speed of insert bearings 
with 5-lip seals is valid under the following 
conditions:
• outer ring temperature ≤ 60 °C (140 °F)
• ambient temperature ≤ 25 °C (80 °F)
• very light to moderate loads (P ≤ 0,05 C)
• cast iron housing
For other conditions, contact SKF 
For applications operating at elevated 
speeds or where low vibration levels or quiet 
running is required, SKF recommends the 
use of either SKF ConCentra insert bearings, 
insert bearings on an adapter sleeve or 
insert bearings with a standard inner ring 


Insert bearings are not intended to accommodate axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing  The distance between 
bearing positions should therefore be short 
to avoid excessive induced axial loads as a 
result of thermal expansion of the shaft 
Design for small axial 
displacement
To accommodate small axial displacement, 
the bearings should be supported by resilient 
sheet metal support surfaces or walls (ig. 30) 
Design for larger axial 
displacement
In applications where there are low speeds 
and light loads, an insert bearing with grub 
screws can be used to accommodate axial 
displacement  The shaft at the non-locating 
bearing position should be provided with one 
or two grooves, 120° apart, to engage a 
modiied grub screw:
• Hexagon socket grub (set) screws with a 
dog point, in accordance with ISO 4028, 
but with a ine thread according to 
table 10. The grub screw should be 
secured by a nut and a spring or star lock 
washer (ig. 31).
The screws and groove(s) accommodate 
changes in shaft length and prevent the 
shaft from turning independently of the 
bearing. The sliding surfaces between the 
shaft and inner ring and those in the shaft 
grooves should be coated with a lubricant 
paste.

Mounting and 
When mounting insert bearings on a shaft, 
suitable tools should be used and the locking 
components should be tightened to the 
torque values / tightening angles listed in:
•  table 13, page 360, for bearings with 
grub screws and bearings with an eccentric 
locking collar
• table 14, page 361, for bearings on an 
adapter sleeve
• table 15, page 362, for SKF ConCentra 
For additional information about mounting 
and dismounting insert bearings and 
assembling ball bearing units, refer to the 
SKF bearing maintenance handbook

Assembling insert 
bearings into 
housings with ﬁtting 
slots
When mounting an insert bearing into a 
housing with itting slots, the bearing should 
be inserted into the itting slot in the housing 
bore (ig. 33) and then swivelled into position  
The misalignment of the bearing relative to 
the housing should not exceed 5°  Eccentric 
locking collars should be removed from the 
bearing prior to mounting and reinstalled 
when the bearing is in position in the housing 
The locking device should face in the same 
direction as the itting slots, except for stainless steel housings and composite housings 
for SKF Food Line with designation sufix L  
Where mounting bearings into these housings, the locking device should face in the 
opposite direction to the itting slots 
Make sure that no relubrication hole or 
groove in the bearing outside diameter 
 coincides with either of the itting slots in  
the housing, otherwise grease leakage may 
result or contamination might enter the 
bearing (ig. 34) 
If the bearing has to be relubricated, make 
sure the relubrication features in the outer 
ring (hole, or groove and hole) coincide with 
the relubrication feature in the housing bore  
The misalignment of the bearing relative to 
the housing should not exceed 2°, otherwise 
relubrication will not be possible (ig. 35) 
SKF recommends mounting SKF insert 
bearings only into SKF housings to avoid a 
mismatch of components and to enable 
proper bearing relubrication

itting slots
Fig. 34
Relubrication hole or groove not to coincide with itting slots


SKF ConCentra insert 
When mounting SKF ConCentra insert bearings, position the collar so that one grub screw 
is directly opposite the slit in the sleeve  
CAUTION: Do not tighten the grub (set) 
screws until the bearing is positioned on the 
shaft  If the screws are tightened prematurely, 
the stepped sleeve may deform  No attempt 
should be made to remove the sleeve and 
the mounting collar from the bearing prior to 
mounting 
To dismount SKF ConCentra insert bearings, 
loosen the grub screws irst. Then gently tap 
the edge of the sleeve on the collar side or 
the inner ring side face on the opposite side 
to loosen the lock (ig. 36).

Four-point contact ball bearings                               


Angular contact ball bearings have inner and 
outer ring raceways that are displaced relative to each other in the direction of the 
bearing axis  This means that these bearings 
are designed to accommodate combined 
loads, i e  simultaneously acting radial and 
axial loads 
The axial load carrying capacity of angular 
contact ball bearings increases as the contact angle increases  The contact angle is 
deined as the angle between the line joining 
the points of contact of the ball and the raceways in the radial plane, along which the 
combined load is transmitted from one raceway to another, and a line perpendicular to 
the bearing axis (ig. 1).
The most commonly used designs are:
• single row angular contact ball bearings 
(ig. 2)
• double row angular contact ball bearings 
(ig. 3)
• four-point contact ball bearings (ig. 4)
In addition to the bearings presented in this 
catalogue, other angular contact ball  
bearings include:
• Super-precision angular contact ball
→ skf.com/super-precision
• Fixed section angular contact ball
These bearings have very thin rings and 
a constant cross-sectional height within 
a particular series, irrespective of the 
bearing size. They are characterized by a 
low weight and high stiffness. SKF ixed 
section bearings have inch sizes and are 
available open or sealed in up to eight 
different cross-sectional heights. 
The designs include:
 – single row angular contact ball bearings
 – four-point contact ball bearings

• Hub bearing units
Hub bearing units (HBU) for the automotive industry are based on double row 
angular contact ball bearings  They have 
made an appreciable contribution to the 
achievement of more compact weight- 
saving designs, simpliied assembly and 
enhanced reliability.
Detailed information about these products and variants for industrial applications can be supplied on request.
• Accommodate combined loads
 – Axial loads in one direction only for  
single row bearings
 – Axial loads in either direction for double 
row and four-point contact bearings
• High load carrying capacity
 – The lower shoulder enables a large 
number of balls to be incorporated in 
single row bearings, giving them their 
relatively high load carrying capacity.
 – Because of the second row of balls, a 
large number of balls are incorporated 
in double row bearings, giving them 
their high load carrying capacity.
 – A large number of balls are incorporated 
in four-point contact bearings, giving 
them their high load carrying capacity.
• Good running properties
High speeds, rapid accelerations and 
decelerations are possible.
Single row angular 
contact ball bearings 
SKF single row angular contact ball bearings 
(ig. 2) can accommodate axial loads in one 
direction only. This type of bearing is typically 
adjusted against a second bearing. Their 
bearing rings have an upper and a lower 
shoulder and are non-separable.
SKF standard assortment
• bearings in the 72 B(E) and 73 B(E) series 
with 40° contact angle
• some sizes in the 70 B series
• sealed bearings:
 – in series 72 B(E) (15 ≤ d ≤ 55 mm)
 – in series 73 B(E) (12 ≤ d ≤ 50 mm)
• bearings in the 72 AC series with 25°

• bearings in the 73 AC series with 25° 
 contact angle (17 ≤ d ≤ 70 mm)
• some large size bearings with a langed 
outer ring (skf com/go/17000-3-1)
• SKF inch bearings (ALS and AMS series, 
skf com/go/17000-3-1)
• are intended for adjusted arrangements 
where only one bearing is used at each 
bearing position and are not suitable for 
mounting immediately adjacent to each 
other
• have Normal tolerances on bearing width 
and standout of the rings
• have different performance capabilities 
compared with SKF Explorer bearings
Bearings for universal 
matching
• are available with 25° and 40° contact 
angles
• are intended to be used in sets
• have ring widths and standouts manufactured to tight tolerances
• can also be used in place of basic design 
bearings for arrangements with single 
bearings, as they typically have higher 
precision, and increased load carrying 
capacity and speed capability
When two bearings are mounted immediately adjacent to each other, a given internal 
clearance or preload or an even load distribution between the two bearings is obtained 
without the use of shims or similar devices 
Bearings for universal matching are identiied by the following sufixes:
• CA, CB, CC or G for internal clearance
• GA, GB or GC for preload
When ordering, indicate the number of individual bearings required and not the number 
of sets 
Double row bearing
Four-point contact bearing


Paired mounting
Paired mounting can be done in three ways 
(ig. 5):
• Tandem arrangement
 – is used where the load carrying capacity 
of a single bearing is inadequate 
 – shares the radial and axial loads equally 
 – has parallel load lines 
 – can accommodate axial loads in one 
direction only 
If axial loads act in both directions, a 
third bearing, adjusted against the 
 tandem pair, must be added 
• Back-to-back arrangement
 – provides a relatively stiff bearing 
 – can accommodate tilting moments 
 – has load lines that diverge from the 
bearing axis 
 – can accommodate axial loads in both 
directions, but only by one bearing in 
each direction
• Face-to-face arrangement 
 – is less sensitive to misalignment but not 
as stiff as a back-to-back arrangement 
 – has load lines that converge towards the 
bearing axis 
 – can accommodate axial loads in both 
directions, but only by one bearing in 
each direction
Bearings with 25° contact 
angle (AC series)
• have a raceway geometry optimized for 
high speeds
• have reduced sensitivity to axial loading 
and misalignment, including the ability to 
accommodate two times higher impact 
loads before edge stresses can occur
• are equipped with an optimized machined 
brass cage as standard
Compared with bearings with 40° contact 
angle, beneits include:
• 20% higher limiting speeds
• higher radial load carrying capacity (by 
trading off lower axial load carrying 
capacity)
• increased robustness when used as the 
backup bearing in sets that are predominantly loaded in one direction
Double row angular 
contact ball bearings
The design of SKF double row angular contact ball bearings (ig. 3, page 385) corresponds to two single row angular contact ball 
bearings arranged back-to-back, but takes 
up less axial space  They can accommodate 
radial loads, axial loads in either direction 
and tilting moments  Double row angular 
contact ball bearings provide stiff bearing 
arrangements 
SKF standard assortment
• bearings in the 32 A and 33 A series 
• bearings with a two-piece inner ring
• capped bearings
• open bearings (that are also available 
capped) that may have recesses in the ring 
side faces
Bearings in the 52 and 53 series are no 
longer available and have been replaced with 
32 A and 33 A series bearings, which are 
dimensionally interchangeable  Only size 
3200 A is different, and has a width of 
14 mm instead of 14,3 mm 
• have different tolerances and performance 
capabilities compared with SKF Explorer 
Bearings with a two-piece 
• incorporate a larger number of balls, and 
have a larger contact angle, giving the 
bearing its high load carrying capacity, 
especially in the axial direction
• are separable in the 33 D series (ig. 6), 
i e  the outer ring with ball and cage 
assemblies can be mounted independently 
of the inner ring halves
• are non-separable in the 33 DNRCBM 
series (ig. 6)
 – have a snap ring groove with a snap ring 
in the outer ring, enabling simple and 
space-saving axial location in the 
housing
 – have been designed speciically for centrifugal pumps, but can also be used in 
other applications

Double row bearings with a two-piece 


Four-point contact 
Four-point contact ball bearings (ig. 4, 
page 385) are radial single row angular contact ball bearings with raceways that are 
designed to support axial loads in both 
directions  For a given axial load, a limited 
radial load can also be supported (Load ratio, 
page 403)  The bearings are separable, i e  
the outer ring with ball and cage assembly 
can be mounted separately from the two 
inner ring halves 
These bearings take up considerably less 
axial space than double row bearings 
Both inner ring halves of SKF Explorer 
four-point contact ball bearings have a 
recessed shoulder  This improves oil low 
when the bearing is used in combination 
with an SKF cylindrical roller bearing (ig. 12, 
page 403). In addition, these recesses can 
be used to facilitate dismounting.
When four-point contact ball bearings are 
subjected to high clamping forces their inner 
ring deformation is limited.

Capped bearings
SKF supplies the following angular contact 
ball bearings capped with a shield or seal on 
both sides:
• single row bearings in the 72 B(E) and 
73 B(E) series:
 – non-contact seals (designation sufix 
2RZ, ig. 8)
• most common double row basic design 
and SKF Explorer bearings:
 – shields (designation sufix 2Z, ig. 9)
 – contact seals (designation sufix 2RS1, 
ig. 10)
For additional information, refer to Integral 
sealing, page 26 
When capped bearings must operate 
under certain conditions, such as very high 
speeds or high temperatures, grease may 
appear between the inner ring and capping 
device  For bearing arrangements where this 
would be detrimental, appropriate actions 
should be taken 


Greases for capped bearings
Bearings capped on both sides are lubricated 
for the life of the bearing and are virtually 
maintenance-free  They are illed with one of 
the following greases (table 2):
• single row bearings 
 – as standard † GXN
• double row bearings
 – as standard † GJN
 – in Europe † MT33 (commonly used and 
widely available)
 – low-friction grease † GE2
• other greases (table 2) can be supplied on 
request
The standard grease is not identiied in the 
bearing designation (no designation sufix)  
Other greases are indicated by the corres- 
ponding grease sufix 
Grease life for capped 
Grease life for capped angular contact ball 
bearings can be estimated as described for

Calculating the axial 
load for bearings 
mounted singly or 
paired in tandem
When a radial load is applied to a single row 
angular contact ball bearing, the load is 
transmitted from one raceway to the other at 
an angle to the bearing axis and an internal 
axial load is induced  This must be con- 
sidered when calculating the equivalent 
bearing loads for bearings in adjusted 
arrangements consisting of two single bearings and/or bearing pairs arranged in 
tandem 
The equations (table 11) are only valid if 
the bearings have identical contact angles 
and are adjusted against each other to practically zero clearance, but without any 
preload  In the table, bearing A is subjected 
to a radial load FrA and bearing B to a radial 
load FrB  Both FrA and FrB are always con- 
sidered positive, even when they act in the 
direction opposite to that shown in the igures  The radial loads act at the pressure 
centres of the bearings (distance a, refer 
to product tables, page 406) 
These calculations can easily be done with 
SKF’s online calculation tools  When the 
bearings are adjusted with clearance or 
preload, or when bearings with different 
contact angles are used, the equations 
become more complex and can be done 
using the SKF SimPro platform 
(skf com/simpro)

SKF recommends oil lubrication for bearings with a ring centred cage (designation 
sufix MA or PHAS). When these bearings are 
grease lubricated, the ndm value is limited to 
250 000 mm/min 
dm =  bearing mean diameter [mm] 
Bearing pairs
For bearings arranged in pairs, the limiting 
speed should be reduced to approximately 
80% of the value quoted for a single bearing

Bearing rings and balls
The bearings are heat stabilized up to at 
least 150 °C (300 °F) 
Steel, brass or PEEK cages can be used at the 
same operating temperatures as the bearing 
rings and balls  For temperature limits of 
cages made of other polymer materials, 
refer to Polymer cages, page 188 
NBR seals is –40 to +100 °C (–40 to 
+210 °F)  Temperatures up to 120 °C 
(250 °F) can be tolerated for brief periods  
Typically, temperature peaks are at the 
seal lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in 
sealed SKF angular contact ball bearings are 
provided in table 2, page 389  For temperature limits of other SKF greases, refer to 
Selecting a suitable SKF grease, page 116 


Single row angular 
contact ball bearings
Proper adjustment
must be used (ig. 11): 
• with a second bearing
• in sets
The bearings must be adjusted against 
each other until the requisite clearance or 
preload is obtained (Selecting preload, 
page 186 
Universally matchable bearings mounted 
immediately adjacent to each other:
• require no further adjustment (Bearings 
for universal matching, page 385)
• obtain requisite clearance or preload by:
 – choosing bearings from an appropriate 
clearance or preload class
 – applying suitable its for the bearings on 
the shaft and in the housing
Performance and operational reliability 
depend on:
• proper adjustment for single bearings
• the correct selection of clearance and 
preload for universally matchable bearings
If there is too much clearance in the 
bearing arrangement during operation, 
the load carrying capacity of the bearings 
will not be fully utilized. Excessive preload 
produces more friction and higher operating temperatures, leading to a reduction in 
bearing service life.
Axial loads in one direction
When the axial load acts predominantly in 
one direction in back-to-back and face-toface arrangements, unfavourable rolling 
conditions for the balls of the axially 
unloaded bearing may occur, which can lead 
to:
• increased noise levels
• discontinuity in the lubricant ilm
• increased stresses on the cage
Under these circumstances, SKF recommends zero operating clearance, which can 
be attained by using springs. When springs 
are not suficient, using bearings with a 25° 
contact angle as a backup bearing may help  
• of Fa/Fr ≥ 1 is required by bearings in the 
70 B, 72 B(E) and 73 B(E) series
• of Fa/Fr ≥ 0,55 is required by bearings in 
the 72 AC and 73 AC series
If the load ratio requirement is not met in 
each case, bearing service life can be 
reduced 
Four-point contact 
Used as a thrust bearing
Four-point contact ball bearings are often 
used as entirely thrust bearings, together 
with a radial bearing  When used in this way, 
the four-point contact ball bearing should be 
mounted with radial clearance in the housing (ig. 12) 
• in combination with a cylindrical roller 
bearing: 
 – the radial internal clearance of the cylindrical roller bearing should be smaller 
than the theoretical radial internal 
clearance of the four-point contact ball 
bearing after both have been mounted
 – the theoretical radial clearance can be 
calculated from:
Cr = 0,7 Ca
Cr = theoretical radial internal clearance
Ca = axial internal clearance (table 9, 
page 397)
 – the outer ring of the four-point contact 
ball bearing must be able to accommodate thermal movements
Therefore, it should not be clamped 
axially, but a small gap should be maintained between the outer ring and the 
cover lange 
 – bearings with locating slots should be 
used (ig. 12) to prevent the outer ring 
from turning
If clamping the outer ring cannot be 
avoided, the outer ring must be carefully 
centred during mounting 
For proper functionality, the balls should 
contact only one inner ring raceway and the 
opposite side of the outer ring raceway  This 
is the case when the load ratio is 
Fa/Fr ≥ 1,27 
A load ratio that is smaller than recommended can reduce bearing service life

4 Self-aligning ball bearings


Self-aligning ball bearings have two rows of 
balls, a common sphered raceway in the 
outer ring and two deep uninterrupted raceway grooves in the inner ring  They are available open or sealed  The bearings are insensitive to angular misalignment of the shaft 
relative to the housing (ig. 1), which can be 
caused, for example, by shaft delection.
• Accommodate static and dynamic
The bearings are self-aligning like spherical roller bearings or CARB bearings.
• Excellent high-speed performance
Self-aligning ball bearings generate less 
friction than any other type of rolling 
bearing, which enables them to run cooler 
even at high speeds.
• Minimum maintenance
Because of low heat generation, the bearing temperature is lower, leading to 
extended bearing life and maintenance 
intervals.
• Low friction
Very loose conformity between balls and 
outer ring keeps friction and frictional heat 
at low levels.
• Excellent light load performance
Self-aligning ball bearings have low minimum load requirements.
• Low noise
Self-aligning ball bearings can reduce 
noise and vibration levels, for example, in 
fans.

Greases for capped bearings
Bearings sealed on both sides are lubricated 
for the life of the bearing and are virtually 
maintenance-free  They are illed with one of 
the following standard greases, which have 
good corrosion-inhibiting properties (table 1):
• D ≤ 62 † MT47 grease
• D > 62 † MT33 grease
Grease life for capped 
• is presented as L10, i e  the time period at 
the end of which 90% of the bearings are 
still reliably lubricated
• depends on the operating temperature 
and the ndm value (diagram 1)
The grease life speciied in diagram 1 is valid 
for the following combination of operating 
conditions:
• horizontal shaft
• inner ring rotation
• light load (P ≤ 0,05 C)
• operating temperature within the green 
temperature zone of the grease (table 1)
• stationary machine
• low vibration levels
Where the operating conditions differ, the 
grease life obtained from the diagram should 
be adjusted:
• vertical shafts † 50% of the obtained value
• heavier loads (P > 0,05 C) † apply reduction factor (table 2)
When sealed bearings must operate under 
certain extreme conditions, such as very 
high speeds or high temperatures, grease 
may appear on the capping diameter  For 
bearing arrangements where this would be 
detrimental, appropriate actions should be 
taken  For additional information, contact 
the SKF application engineering service

friction is preferred over high load carrying 
capacity (e g  in the paper industry)
Bearings with an 
extended inner ring
• are (ig. 8) designed for less demanding 
applications that use commercial grade 
shafting
• have a special bore tolerance, class JS7 
(table 3), that facilitates mounting and 
• are located axially on the shaft by means 
of a slot at one end of the inner ring that 
engages a pin or shoulder screw (ig. 9) 
itted to the shaft
This also prevents the shaft from spinning in the bearing bore

Ball protrusion
The balls of some bearings in the 12 and 13 
series protrude from the side faces of the 
bearing (ig. 10). The values of the protrusion are listed in the product table, 
page 457, and should be considered when 
designing components in close proximity to 
the bearing.
Bearings on sleeves
Self-aligning ball bearings with a tapered 
bore can be mounted with:
• an adapter sleeve on plain or stepped 
shafts (ig. 11)
• a withdrawal sleeve on stepped shafts  
(ig. 12)
Adapter sleeves are supplied complete with 
a locking device.
For appropriate SKF adapter sleeves, refer 
to the product table, page 458.
When using sealed bearings, make sure 
appropriate SKF adapter sleeve assemblies 
(e.g. E design sleeve, refer to the product 
table) are used to prevent the locking device 
from interfering with the seal (ig. 13). Alternatively, use a spacer ring between the 
bearing and the lock washer.
For additional information 
●  Adapter sleeves, page 1065
●  Withdrawal sleeves, page 1087
Bearings with an 
extended inner ring
When two of these bearings are used to 
support a shaft, to locate the shaft axially the 
inner ring slots must be arranged facing 
towards or away from each other (ig. 9, 
page 441).

Mounting bearings 
with a cylindrical 
bore
Refer to Mounting bearings with a cylindrical 
bore, page 201 
Mounting bearings 
with a tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered bore are mounted 
with an interference it, by using one of the 
following methods:
1 Feeling the clearance reduction by 
turning and swivelling the outer ring 
(ig. 14)
 – This method is valid for bearings with 
Normal radial clearance (not for sealed 
bearings) 
 – The clearance reduction in the bearing 
is suficient when the outer ring can be 
turned easily, but a slight resistance is 
felt when it is swivelled out 
2 Measuring the lock nut tightening angle 
(table 7, page 448)
3 Measuring the axial drive-up (table 7)
4 Applying the SKF Drive-up Method
For bearings with d ≥ 50 mm, SKF recommends using the SKF Drive-up Method  
This is a fast, reliable and safe method to 
determine the appropriate interference it  
Additional information is available online 
at skf com/drive-up 
For additional information about these 
mounting methods, refer to Mounting bearings with a tapered bore, page 203, or the 
SKF bearing maintenance handbook

5 Thrust ball bearings


SKF thrust ball bearings (ig. 1) are manufactured as single direction or double direction thrust ball bearings  They are designed 
to accommodate axial loads only and must 
not be subjected to any radial load  
• Separable and interchangeable
The separable components of SKF thrust 
ball bearings are interchangeable (ig. 2) 
This facilitates mounting and dismounting, 
and maintenance inspections 
• Initial misalignment
Bearings with sphered housing washer(s) 
(ig. 3) can accommodate initial 
• Interference it
Shaft washers have a ground bore to enable an interference it. The bore of the 
housing washer is turned and always 
larger than the shaft washer bore.

5 Thrust ball bearings


Single direction 
thrust ball bearings
• consist of a shaft washer, a housing 
washer and a ball and cage assembly 
(ig. 4)
• can accommodate axial loads and locate a 
shaft axially, in one direction only
Double direction 
thrust ball bearings
• consist of one shaft washer, two housing 
washers and two ball and cage assemblies 
(ig. 5)
The housing washers and ball and cage 
assemblies of double direction bearings 
are identical to those used in single direction bearings  
• can accommodate axial loads and locate a 
shaft axially, in both directions

5 Thrust ball bearings
Bearings with 
sphered housing 
washers
• can accommodate initial misalignment
• are available in both single (ig. 6) and 
double direction designs
• can be used together with a sphered seat 
washer adjacent to the housing washer 
(ig. 7) or adjacent to a machine component 
manufactured with a sphered surface
Appropriate sphered seat washers must be 
ordered separately (product tables, 
page 482, and page 490)  Depending on the 
bearing series, they have the basic designation U 2, U 3 or U 4 followed by a two-digit 
number, which identiies the size, e g

The speed ratings in the product tables 
indicate:
temperature and speed, page 130 
Where mounting a single direction thrust 
ball bearing, it is important to differentiate 
between the shaft washer and the housing 
washer  The bore of the shaft washer is 
ground and always smaller than the bore of 
the housing washer  The shaft washer 
should always be placed against a shaft step 
or ixed shaft component.
thrust ball bearings can be limited by:

Bearing washers and balls
Depending on their size, washers and balls 
of SKF thrust ball bearings are heat stabilized 
up to:
• 125 °C (260 °F) where d ≤ 300 mm
• 150 °C (300 °F) where d > 300 mm
Steel and brass cages can be used at the 
same operating temperatures as the bearing 
washers and balls 
Seat washers
Seat washers are made of steel and can be 
used at the same operating temperatures as 
the bearing washers and balls 
For temperature limits of SKF greases, refer 
to Selecting a suitable SKF grease, page 116

SKF cylindrical roller bearings are available 
in many designs, series and sizes  The major 
design differences between the cylindrical 
roller bearings presented in this catalogue 
are in:
• the number of roller rows (one or two)
• the type of cage (with, without or special 
designs)
 – Bearings with a cage can accommodate 
heavy radial loads and peak loads, rapid 
accelerations and high speeds 
 – Full complement bearings (without 
cage) incorporate a maximum number 
of rollers and are therefore suitable for 
very heavy radial loads at moderate 
speeds 
 – SKF high-capacity cylindrical roller 
bearings combine the high load carrying 
capacity of a full complement bearing 
with the high speed capability of a bearing with cage 
• the coniguration of the inner and outer 
ring langes (position and number of guide 
langes, ig. 1)
• High load carrying capacity
• High stiffness
• Accommodate axial displacement (ig. 2)
Except for bearings with langes on both 
the inner and outer rings 
• Low friction
The open lange design (ig. 3), together 
with the roller end design and surface inish, promote lubricant ilm formation 
resulting in lower friction and higher axial 
load carrying capacity 
The logarithmic roller proile reduces edge 
stresses at the roller/raceway contact 
(ig. 4) and sensitivity to misalignment and 
shaft delection 
Selecting internal clearance

Open lange design
Load distribution for the logarithmic roller 
proile
Interchangeable components
• Enhanced operational reliability
The surface inish on the contact surfaces 
of the rollers and raceways supports the 
formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant 
ilm 
• Separable and interchangeable
The separable components of SKF cylindrical roller bearings are interchangeable 
(ig. 5)  This facilitates mounting and 
 dismounting, as well as maintenance 
inspections 
In addition to the cylindrical roller bearings 
presented in this catalogue, SKF supplies 
cylindrical roller bearings for special application requirements  This assortment includes:

Single row cylindrical 
The major design differences between the 
single row cylindrical roller bearings presented in this catalogue are in: 
• the cage design and material 
• the coniguration of the inner and outer 
ring langes 
SKF inch bearings (CRL and CRM series, 
skf com/go/17000-6-1), which are not presented in this catalogue, conform to the 
metric N design (ig. 6)  They are mainly 
used in the aftermarket and, therefore, SKF 
recommends not to use these bearings for 
new bearing arrangement designs 
Common designs
The most common designs of single row 
cylindrical roller bearings are shown in ig. 6 
NU design bearings
• have two integral langes on the outer ring 
and no langes on the inner ring
• can accommodate axial displacement of 
the shaft relative to the housing in both 
• can be used together with an appropriate 
angle ring to stabilize the bearing in the 
axial direction (ig. 7, Appropriate angle 
rings)
N design bearings
• have two integral langes on the inner ring 
and no langes on the outer ring
• can accommodate axial displacement of 
the shaft relative to the housing in both 
NJ design bearings

and one integral lange and one non-integral lange, i e  a loose lange ring, on the 
• are used to locate the shaft axially in both 
Appropriate angle rings (thrust 
collars)
• are used with NU design bearings to locate 
the shaft axially in one direction (ig. 7)
Angle rings should not be used on both 
sides of NU design bearings as this can 
lead to axial clamping of the rollers 
• are used with NJ design bearings to locate 
the shaft axially in both directions (ig. 8)
• are made of carbon chromium steel
• are hardened and ground
• have a maximum axial run-out that is in 
accordance with the Normal tolerance 
class for the appropriate bearing
• are identiied by the series designation HJ 
followed by the appropriate bearing 
dimension series and size
• are available as listed in the product table, 
page 517 
• must be ordered separately

Reasons to design angle rings into a bearing 
arrangement include:
• no NJ or NUP design locating bearings in 
the product range
• to provide an extend inner ring seat for 
heavily loaded bearings in the locating 
position:
 – full width inner ring seat of NJ design 
bearings with an HJ angle ring compared to NUP design bearings having a 
shorter inner ring and a loose lange
• to simplify design or mounting procedures

hardened and ground raceways can be 
machined on the shaft or in the housing 
(Raceways on shafts and in housings, 
page 179)


High-capacity 
cylindrical roller 
SKF high-capacity cylindrical roller bearings 
(ig. 15) are designed for applications such 
as industrial gearboxes, wind turbine gearboxes and mining equipment 
The cage bars are displaced relative to the 
roller pitch diameter to enable the rollers to 
be placed closer to each other, creating room 
for additional rollers (ig. 16) and thereby 
increasing load carrying capacity and radial 
stiffness 
The black oxide coating of rings and rollers (designation sufix L4B) contributes to 
extended service life by improving:
• smearing damage resistance
• running-in properties and reducing 
friction
• performance under poor lubrication 
• chemical resistance (from agressive oil 
additives)
• corrosion resistance
SKF high-capacity cylindrical roller bearings 
are available in three different main designs 
and some variants 
Bearings with a tapered bore
• are available with a 1:12 tapered bore 
(designation sufix K, ig. 12)
• have radial internal clearance greater than 
corresponding bearings with a cylindrical 
bore
Bearings with a snap ring groove 
in the outer ring
• are identiied by the designation sufix N 
(ig. 13)
• can be axially located in the housing by a 
snap ring:
 – to save space
 – to reduce mounting time
Bearings with locating slots in the 
• are available with one or two locating slots 
(designation sufix N1 or N2, ig. 14)
The two locating slots are positioned 
180° apart 
• can be used to prevent the outer ring from 
turning where it must be mounted with a 
loose it

cylindrical roller 
SKF single row full complement cylindrical 
roller bearings are suitable for very heavy 
radial loads and provide increased radial 
stiffness 
The basic SKF assortment of single row 
full complement cylindrical roller bearings 
provided in this catalogue includes NCF and 
NJG design bearings (ig. 20)  They are used 
to locate the shaft axially in one direction and 
eventually to accommodate axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing in 
the opposite direction 
NCF design bearings
• have two integral langes on the inner ring 
and one on the outer ring
• have a retaining ring in the outer ring, on 
the side opposite the integral lange, to 
hold the bearing together
The retaining ring should not be loaded 
axially during operation 
NJG design bearings
• comprise the heavy 23 dimension series
• are intended for very heavily loaded, lowspeed applications
• have two integral langes on the outer ring 
and one on the inner ring
• have a self-retaining roller complement
Therefore, the outer ring with the roller 
complement can be separated from the 
inner ring without having to take special 
precautions to prevent the rollers from 
falling out (ig. 21)  This simpliies mounting and dismounting

cylindrical roller 
SKF double row full complement cylindrical 
roller bearings are, because of their second 
row of rollers, suitable for very heavy radial 
loads and provide increased radial stiffness 
The basic SKF assortment provided in this 
catalogue includes (ig. 22): 
• three different designs of open bearings:
 – NNCL design
 – NNCF design
 – NNC design
• NNF design sealed bearings
SKF double row full complement cylindrical 
roller bearings are non-separable and have 
an annular groove and lubrication holes in 
the outer ring to facilitate lubrication  NNF 
design bearings have additional lubrication 
holes in the inner ring 


NNCL design bearings
• have three integral langes on the inner 
ring and no langes on the outer ring
• have a retaining ring in the outer ring 
between the roller rows to hold the bearing together
The retaining ring should not be loaded 
axially during operation 
• can accommodate axial displacement of 
the shaft relative to the housing in both 
NNCF design bearings
• have three integral langes on the inner 
ring and one on the outer ring
• have a retaining ring in the outer ring, on 
the side opposite the integral lange, to 
hold the bearing together
The retaining ring should not be loaded 
axially during operation 
• are used to locate the shaft axially in one 
direction and eventually to accommodate 
axial displacement of the shaft relative to 
the housing in the opposite direction
NNC design bearings
• have the same inner ring as NNCL and 
NNCF design bearings
• have a two-piece outer ring:
 – held together by retaining elements, 
which should never be loaded axially
 – consisting of two identical outer ring 
parts with one integral lange on each
• are used to locate the shaft axially in both 
Alternative NNC design bearings may consist 
of a one-piece outer ring with one integral 
lange and a lange ring 
NNF design sealed bearings
• comprise the 50 and 3194‥ series
• have a two-piece inner ring:
 – held together by a retaining ring
 – with three integral langes
• have one integral central lange on the 
• are used to locate the shaft axially in both 
• can accommodate tilting moments 
because of the distance between the two 
rows of rollers
• have an outer ring that is 1 mm narrower 
than the inner ring
• do not require spacer rings between the 
inner ring and adjacent components, in 
applications with a rotating outer ring
• have two snap ring grooves in the outer 
ring:
 – to simplify mounting
 – to save space axially
This is especially valuable where the 
bearing is mounted in/on an adjacent 
component, e g  in rope sheaves 
(ig. 23)

good rust-inhibiting properties (table 1, 
page 503)
For additional information about 
greases, refer to Lubrication, page 109 
• can be supplied open and without grease, 
for applications where oil lubrication is to 
be used
If a small quantity of bearings without 
seals is required, the seals can be removed 
and the bearings can be washed prior to 
mounting 
Relubrication
For many application conditions, NNF design 
sealed bearings do not require relubrication 
and can be considered relubrication-free  
However, if they operate in a moist or contaminated environment, or if speeds are 
moderate to high, relubrication may be 
 necessary (Estimating the relubrication interval 
for grease, page 111)  The bearings can be 
relubricated via lubrication holes in both the 
inner and outer rings

Cylindrical roller bearings with langes on both the inner and outer 
rings can support, in addition to radial loads, axial loads up to:
• Fa ≤ 0,25 Fr for double row full complement bearings
• Fa ≤ 0,5 Fr for other design bearings

The axial load carrying capacity is determined by the lubrication 
condition, operating temperature and heat dissipation at the roller 
end / lange contact 
The formulae below are valid for normal operating conditions:
• ΔT ≈ 60 °C between the bearing operating and ambient 
• speciic heat loss ≈ 0,5 mW/mm2
• viscosity ratio κ ≥ 2
• misalignment ≤ 1 minute of arc
For misalignment > 1 minute of arc, contact the SKF application engineering service

Bearing rings and rollers
SKF cylindrical roller bearings are heat stabilized up to 150 °C (300 °F) 
Steel, brass, light alloy or PEEK cages can be 
used at the same operating temperatures as 
the bearing rings and rollers  For temperature limits of cages made of other polymer 
materials, refer to Polymer cages, page 188 
PUR seals is –20 to +80 °C (–5 to +175 °F) 
Typically, temperature peaks are at the 
seal lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in 
sealed double row full complement cylindrical roller bearings are provided in table 1, 
page 503  For temperature limits of other 
SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable 
SKF grease, page 116 
The speed ratings in the product tables 
indicate:
temperature and speed, page 130 
SKF recommends oil lubrication for bearings with a ring centred cage  When these 
bearings are grease lubricated, the ndm 
value is limited:
• for bearings with an LA, LB, LL, MA, MB, 
ML, MP, JA, JB or MH cage
† ndm ≤ 250 000 mm/min
• for bearings with a PA or PHA cage
† ndm ≤ 450 000 mm/min
dm  =  bearing mean diameter [mm] 
n  = rotational speed [r/min] 
For single row bearings with a standard 
cage, the values for the limiting speed are 
listed in the product tables  Conversion factors to estimate the limiting speed for bearings with an alternative standard cage are 
listed in table 7

Where cylindrical roller bearings are subjected to axial loads, total axial run-out (Tolerances for bearing seats and abutments, 
page 144) and the size of the abutment surfaces of adjacent components are particularly important for an even load distribution 
on the lange 
The inner ring lange should only be supported up to half of its height (ig. 24) so that 
it is not subjected to damaging alternating 
stresses that can result, for example, from 
shaft delection 
For single row bearings and high-capacity 
bearings the recommended shaft abutment 
diameter can be obtained using
das = 0,5 (d1 + F)
das  =  shaft abutment diameter for axially 
loaded bearings [mm]
d1  =  inner ring lange diameter [mm] 
(product tables, page 516)
F  =  inner ring raceway diameter [mm] 
(product tables)
For full complement bearings, the recommended shaft abutment diameter das is 
listed in the product tables 
Because of the design and position of the 
cage of high-capacity cylindrical roller bearings in the NCF    ECJB and NJF    ECJA 
series, the cage cannot prevent the rollers 
from falling out when the inner and outer 
rings of the bearing are separated  SKF recommends mounting these high-capacity 
cylindrical roller bearings as a complete 
bearing, like full complement cylindrical 
Where it is necessary to mount the inner 
and outer rings separately, use a mounting 
sleeve (ig. 25) or a retaining strap (ig. 26) 
to keep the rollers in place

Lubrication                                    239
SKF needle roller bearings are bearings with 
cylindrical rollers that are small in diameter 
relative to their length  The modiied roller/
raceway proile prevents stress peaks to 
extend bearing service life 
SKF supplies needle roller bearings in 
many different designs, series and in a wide 
range of sizes, which make them appropriate 
for a wide variety of operating conditions and 
• Low cross section
In applications where less space is available, needle roller bearings offer a very 
compact solution (ig. 1), and drawn cup 
needle roller bearings enable downsizing 
• High load carrying capacity
Owing to their large number of rollers, 
needle roller bearings have a high load 
carrying capacity 
• High stiffness
Because of their large number of 
small-diameter rollers, needle roller bearings have high stiffness 
Selecting internal clearance           
• Separable design
The possibility of assembling inner and 
outer rings separately permits interference its for shaft and housing and also 
enables easy maintenance inspections 
(ig. 2) 
• Accommodate axial displacement
Except for bearings with langes on both 
the inner and outer rings, needle roller 
bearings with machined rings can accommodate axial displacement (ig. 3) 
• Accommodate static misalignment
Alignment needle roller bearings are 
self-aligning up to 3° of static 
• Locating bearing arrangement
Combined needle roller bearings accommodate combined radial and axial loads in 
one or both directions 
Separable design
Low cross section


Needle roller and 
cage assemblies
SKF needle roller and cage assemblies are 
self -contained, ready- to -mount bearings  
In applications where the shaft and housing 
bore can serve as raceways, the assemblies 
can be used to create bearing arrangements 
that require minimal radial space 
• are identiied by the series designation K
• are available as (ig. 4): 
 – single row design (no designation sufix)
 – double row design (designation sufix ZW)
They are characterized by the following 
properties:
• simple to mount and robust
• accurate roller guidance in the cage 
pockets
• good running performance
Needle roller and cage assembly


Other needle roller and cage 
assemblies
Needle roller and cage assemblies with a 
split cage can be used where raceways are 
recessed in the shaft (ig. 5) 
Special needle roller and cage assemblies 
are used for the gudgeon (wrist) pin (ig. 6) 
and crankpin (crankshaft journal) (ig. 7) for 
connecting rods of internal combustion 
engines and compressors  They provide 
excellent service in spite of rapid accelerations, elevated temperatures, unfavourable 
load, and poor lubrication conditions 
For additional information about special 
sizes and designs, which are available on 
request, contact SKF 
Special needle roller and cage assembly for the gudgeon (wrist) pin 
Special needle roller and cage assembly for the crankpin (crankshaft journal)
Drawn cup needle 
SKF drawn cup needle roller bearings have a 
deep drawn, thin-walled outer ring  Drawn 
cup needle roller bearings are typically used 
in applications where the housing bore cannot be used as a raceway for a needle roller 
and cage assembly, but where a very compact and economical bearing arrangement is 
required  These bearings are mounted with 
a tight interference it in the housing  This 
enables a simple and economic design of the 
housing bore, as shoulders or snap rings are 
not required to locate the bearing axially 
The drawn cup of hardened steel and the 
needle roller and cage assembly of these 
bear ings form a non -separable unit 
SKF standard assortment
SKF supplies a wide assortment of drawn 
cup needle roller bearings  This includes:
• bearings with open ends (ig. 8)
• bearings with a closed end (ig. 9)
• full complement bearings with open ends 
(ig. 10)
SKF drawn cup needle roller bear ings:
• are supplied without an inner ring
• are generally designed with one needle 
roller and cage assembly – except wide 
sizes, which incorpor ate two needle roller 
and cage assemblies immediately adjacent 
to each other, with a lubrication hole in the 
outer ring (ig. 11) 
Needle roller and cage assemblies with a split cage
584


• Drawn cup needle roller bearings with 
open ends (series designation HK, ig. 8)
 – are available open (without seals) or 
sealed on one or both sides (Sealing 
solutions, page 594)
• Drawn cup needle roller bearings with a 
closed end (series designation BK, ig. 9)
 – are available open or sealed (Sealing 
solutions)
 – are suitable for bearing arrangements 
where they are situated at the end of a 
shaft
 – accommodate small axial guidance 
forces, because of the proiled design of 
their closed end
• Full complement bearings with open 
ends (series designation HN, ig. 10)
 – are suitable for very heavy radial loads 
at moderate speeds
 – are available with open ends and without seals only
Full complement drawn cup needle roller 
bearings are supplied with a special 
grease to secure the rollers during transport. However, SKF recommends relubricating after mount ing. Depending on the 
required grade, SKF recommends 
SKF LGEP 2 or SKF LGWM 1 grease for 
relu brication  The technical speciications 
of the initial grease ill and the relubrication greases are listed in table 1.

bearings with 
machined rings
SKF needle roller bearings with machined 
rings are made of carbon chromium bearing 
steel  SKF supplies these bearings with or 
without langes on the outer ring, in a wide 
range of series and sizes. SKF also supplies 
them with or without an inner ring.
inner and outer rings
• are used for applications where the shaft 
cannot be hardened and ground (ig. 14)
• have limited permissible axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing 
(ig. 3, page 583 and product table, 
page 636), which can be extended, if 
needed, by using a wide inner ring (Needle 
roller bearing inner rings, page 593)
Needle roller bearings with a machined 
outer ring, without an inner ring
• are an excellent choice for compact bearing arrangements if the shaft can be hardened and ground (ig. 15)
• enable a larger shaft diameter and a stiffer 
bearing arrangement compared to 
arrangements with bearings with inner 
Axial displacement of the shaft relative to the 
housing is only limited by the width of the 
raceway on the shaft. By machining the shaft 
raceways to the appropriate dimensional 
and geometrical tolerances, it is possible to 
obtain bearing arrangements with tighter 
geometrical tolerances. For additional information, refer to Raceways on shafts and in 
housings, page 179.

• Generally, drawn cup needle roller bearings run directly on a shaft. However, in 
applications where the shaft cannot be 
hardened and ground, bearings should be 
combined with an inner ring (ig. 12, and 
Needle roller bearing inner rings, 
page 593).
• Drawn cup needle roller bearings with 
wide inner rings (ig. 12 and Needle roller 
bearing inner rings) provide an excellent 
counterface for the lips of external G or SD 
design seals (skf.com/seals).
• Certain sizes of drawn cup needle roller 
bearings can be combined with a needle 
roller thrust bearing with a centring 
lange, AXW series (ig. 13 and Needle 
roller thrust bearings, page 895), to 
accommodate combined radial and axial 
loads.

Needle roller bearings with 
machined rings, with langes
• are available open (without seals) or 
sealed on one or both sides
• are available with or without an inner ring
• with D ≤ 17 mm (Fw ≤ 10 mm), are available with non-separable closure rings that 
act as langes (ig. 16)
The langes on larger bearings are an 
integral part of the outer ring, and the 
bearings have an annular groove and one 
or more lubrication holes in the outer ring 
(ig. 17) 
• are generally designed as single row bearings, with the exception of RNA 69 (ig. 18) 
and NA 69 series double row bearings 
with D ≥ 52 mm (Fw ≥ 40 mm)
The roller and cage assembly and outer ring 
of a needle roller bearing with langes form a 
non-separable unit 
Separable design
Needle roller bearings with 
machined rings, without langes
• are separable, i e  the outer ring, needle 
roller and cage assembly, and inner ring, 
can all be mounted separately (ig. 19)
Needle roller and cage assemblies can, 
depending on the arrangement design, 
either be mounted:
 – together with the outer ring
 – together with the shaft
 – together with the inner ring
 – between the outer ring and shaft or 
inner ring as the inal step
However, needle roller and cage 
assemblies and bearing outer rings 
must always be kept together as 
supplied 
• are generally designed with one needle 
roller and cage assembly
However, wide sizes incorporate two 
needle roller and cage assemblies immediately adjacent to each other and have an 
annular groove and a lubrication hole in 
the outer ring (ig. 20)

Needle roller / angular 
contact ball bearings
SKF supplies needle roller / angular contact 
ball bearings without seals in two series 
(ig. 23):
• NKIA 59 series bearings can accommodate 
axial loads in one direction
• NKIB 59 series bearings can accommodate axial loads in both directions
These combined bearings:
• consist of a radial needle roller bearing 
and an angular contact ball bearing
• accommodate heavy radial loads, carried 
exclusively by the needle roller bearing
• accommodate light axial loads, carried 
exclusively by the angular contact ball 
• are low cross section bearings
• can operate at high speeds
• are separable, i.e. the inner ring can be 
mounted separately from the outer ring 
and rolling element and cage assemblies
• can be grease or oil lubricated, depending 
on the application
In the case of grease lubrication, both 
the needle roller and angular contact ball 
bearings should be illed with the same 
lubricant prior to mounting 
Alignment needle 
SKF alignment needle roller bearings have 
an outer ring with a sphered (convex) outside surface  Two polymer seating rings with 
a sphered (concave) inside surface are 
encased in a drawn sheet steel sleeve and 
itted over the outer ring  
SKF supplies alignment needle roller 
bearings with or without an inner ring 
(ig. 22) 
Bearings with an inner ring
• should be used in applications where the 
shaft cannot be hardened and ground
• have limited permissible axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing 
(product table, page 650), which can be 
extended, if needed, by using a wide inner 
ring (Needle roller bearing inner rings, 
page 593)
Bearings without an inner ring
• are an excellent choice for compact bearing arrangements, if the shaft can be 
hardened and ground 
Combined needle 
SKF combined needle roller bearings consist 
of a radial needle roller bearing combined 
with a thrust bearing  They can accommodate both radial and axial loads  They are 
particularly suitable for applications where 
other types of locating bearing arrangements occupy too much space, or where the 
axial loads are too heavy, the speeds are too 
high, or the lubricant is inadequate for 
arrangements with simple thrust washers  
SKF supplies combined needle roller bearings in the following basic designs:
• needle roller / angular contact ball bearing
• needle roller / thrust ball bearing
• needle roller / cylindrical roller thrust 
Relubrication intervals for the radial and 
thrust part of the bearing must be calculated 
separately  The shorter of the two intervals 
should be used  For additional information 
about lubrication, refer to Lubrication,

NKIA series bearings
• can accommodate axial loads in one direction and, therefore, locate the shaft in one 
direction only
• can be mounted back-to-back (ig. 24), for 
short shafts and where changes in length 
due to thermal expansion are relatively 
minor
NKIB series bearings
• can locate the shaft in both directions
• have axial clearance, between 0,08 and 
0,25 mm
• have a two-piece inner ring to facilitate 
mounting
When mounting the inner ring, it is 
important that the two pieces are axially 
clamped to one another 
• have inner rings, which are not interchangeable with those from another 
seemingly identical bearing (keep together 
as supplied)
589


NX series bearings
• consist of a radial needle roller bearing 
and a full complement thrust ball bearing 
(ig. 28)
• are suitable for applications where there 
are moderate radial loads and lighter, single direction axial loads
• have low cross-sectional height, which 
enables shaft centrelines to be positioned 
close together like for multi-spindle drills
• can be mounted with a snap ring, or 
against a shoulder in the housing bore, for 
axial support
The snap ring groove in the outer ring 
provides a cost-effective and axially 
space-saving solution (ig. 29 and product tables, 7.8, page 654) 
• are most often oil lubricated and therefore 
supplied without grease
• have a stamped steel cover that
 – extends over the shaft washer of the full 
complement thrust ball bearing
 – is irmly attached to the radial needle 
 – makes these bearings non-separable
 – has lubrication holes as standard
 – has no lubrication holes for bearings 
with designation sufix Z (ig. 28)
These bearings can be grease 
lubricated.
Needle roller / thrust ball 
SKF supplies needle roller / thrust ball bearings in two series (ig. 25):
• NX series with a full comple ment thrust 
ball bearing
• NKX series with a thrust ball bearing with 
a cage
These combined bearings:
• consist of a radial needle roller bearing 
and a thrust ball bearing
• are supplied without an inner ring
• can be combined with an inner ring 
(ig. 26), where the shaft cannot be hardened and ground (product tables, 
page 654 and page 656, must be ordered 
separately)
• can accommodate axial loads in one direction and, therefore, locate the shaft in one 
direction only
• can be mounted back-to-back (ig. 27), for 
short shafts and where changes in length 
due to thermal expansion are relatively 
minor
For these types of arrangements, SKF 
recommends preloading the thrust ball 
bearings with Belleville washers (cup 
springs). This preload helps to prevent the 
balls from skidding if one of the thrust 
bearings becomes unloaded. Preload also 
improves performance of the thrust ball 
bearings while reducing noise levels.

Needle roller / cylindrical 
roller thrust bearings
SKF supplies needle roller / cylindrical roller 
thrust bearings in the NKXR series (ig. 31) 
These combined bearings:
• consist of a radial needle roller bearing 
and a cylindrical roller thrust bearing
The cylindrical roller and cage thrust 
assembly is identical to the 811 series 
• are supplied without an inner ring
• can be combined with an inner ring 
(ig. 32), where the shaft cannot be hardened and ground (product table, 
page 658, must be ordered separately)
• can accommodate axial loads in one 
• can locate the shaft in one direction only
• can be mounted back-to-back (ig. 33) for 
short shafts and where changes in length 
due to thermal expansion are relatively 
minor
For these types of arrangements, SKF 
recommends preloading the thrust ball 
bearings with Belleville washers (cup 
springs)  This elastic preload helps to prevent the balls from skidding if one of the 
thrust bearings becomes unloaded  
Preload also improves performance of the 
thrust ball bearings while reducing noise 
levels 
NKXR series bearings

Needle roller bearing 
components 
Needle roller bearing inner 
SKF supplies inner rings for needle roller 
bearings separately  They are typically combined with needle roller and cage assemblies 
(page 583) or drawn cup needle roller bearings (page 584) in applications where the 
shaft cannot be hardened and ground  
Inner rings are available in two series 
(ig. 35):
• IR series
 – with or without a lubrication hole
 – with or without a machining allowance
• LR series
Both inner ring series:
• are also available in different widths
• permit greater axial displacement of the 
shaft, relative to the housing, when they 
are wider than standard
 – provide an excellent counterface for the 
lips of contact seals (ig. 12, page 586)
• should be located on both sides to prevent 
axial movement (regardless of whether 
the ring has an interference or loose it)
 – one side can be located against a 
shoulder
 – the other side can be located by either a 
snap ring, a distance ring or a nut
IR series inner rings
• are the standard SKF inner rings for needle roller bearings
• are hardened and ground
• have a precision ground raceway surface 
with a lead-in chamfer on both sides
The chamfers facilitate assembly and 
protect the seal lips from damage during 
the mounting process 
• are available in some sizes with a lubrication hole (designation sufix IS1, ig. 36)
Inner rings with additional lubrication 
holes are available on request 
• are available on request with a pre-ground 
raceway and a machining allowance 
(designation sufix VGS, table 2)
They can be inish ground after mounting on a shaft in applications where 
extremely tight geometrical tolerances are 
required 
LR series inner rings
• are hardened, and the bore and raceway 
diameter are ground
• side faces are turned and the edges are 
smoothed
• can be used to provide a cost-effective 
bearing arrangement for applications 
where the larger run-out and width tolerances are less important

Needle rollers
Needle rollers can be used to design full 
complement bearing arrangements for lowspeed or oscillating applications  These compact bearing arrangements have a very high 
load carrying capacity when compared to 
bearings with a cage and are economical, 
provided the shaft and housing bore can 
serve as raceways (Raceways on shafts and 
in housings, page 179) 
Needle rollers:
• are not listed in this catalogue, but can be 
found online at skf com/go/17000-7-12
• are made of carbon chromium steel
• have a hardness of 58 to 65 HRC
• have a precision ground surface
For assistance in designing full complement 
bearing arrangements or to calculate performance data for these bearing arrangements, contact the SKF application engineering service.

Sealing solutions
Associated external seals
• can be used for needle roller bearing 
arrangements (ig. 12, page 586)
• can be supplied in various sizes, as listed in 
the product tables:
 – Needle roller and cage assemblies, 
page 614
 – Drawn cup needle roller bearings, 
page 618
 – Needle roller bearings with machined 
rings with langes, without an inner ring, 
page 624
For information about associated power 
transmission seals, refer to skf com/seals 
Capped bearings
SKF supplies certain needle roller bearings 
capped with a seal or steel cover  The assortment of capped bearings includes:
• drawn cup needle roller bearings, sealed 
on one or both sides
• needle roller bearings with machined 
rings in the (R)NA 49 series, sealed on one 
or both sides
• combined needle roller bearings, capped 
with a steel cover over the thrust part of 
the bearing
When capped bearings must operate under 
certain conditions, such as very high speeds 
or high temperatures, some grease may 
leak  For bearing arrangements where this 
would be detrimental, appropriate actions 
could be taken 
Sealed drawn cup needle roller 
For applications where a suficiently effective 
seal is not available, or cannot be used for 
space reasons, SKF supplies certain drawn 
cup needle roller bearings as sealed bearings  The assortment includes:
• drawn cup needle roller bearings with 
open ends (ig. 37)
 – available for 8 ≤ Fw ≤ 50 mm
 – sealed on one side (designation 
sufix RS)
 – sealed on both sides (designation 
sufix  2RS)
• sealed drawn cup needle roller bearings 
with a closed end (designation sufix RS, 
ig. 38)
 – available for 10 ≤ Fw ≤ 25 mm
These integral contact seals are made of 
PUR, FKM or NBR  Sealed drawn cup needle 
roller bearings are, under normal conditions 
and with appropriate counterface, an 
extremely cost-effective solution to exclude 
solid contaminants and moisture, and retain 
the lubricant in the bearing

 WARNING
Seals made of FKM (luoro rubber) 
exposed to an open lame or temperatures above 300 °C (570 °F) are a health 
and environmental hazard! They remain 
dangerous even after they have cooled 
Read and follow the safety precautions on page 197 
BK ‥ RS


Sealed needle roller bearings with 
machined rings
• are available in the (R)NA 49 series with a 
contact seal made of NBR (effective at 
keeping the lubricant in and contaminants 
out of the bearing) on one (designation 
sufix RS) or both sides (designation sufix  2RS) (ig. 39)
• have an inner ring that is 1 mm wider than 
the outer ring, which maintains the effectiveness of the seals and simpliies the 
bearing arrangements even when small 
axial displacements occur
Capped combined needle roller 
SKF supplies certain combined needle roller 
bearings capped with a stamped steel cover 
over the thrust part of the bearing (designation sufix Z)  The cover, which has no lubrication holes, forms a gap-type seal to retain 
the grease in the bearing  The assortment 
includes:
• needle roller / full complement thrust ball 
bearings (ig. 28, page 591)
• needle roller / thrust ball bearings (ig. 30, 
page 591) 
• needle roller / cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings (ig. 34, page 592)
Greases for capped bearings
Needle roller bearings with one or two seals 
are supplied greased  The thrust part of 
combined needle roller bearings with the 
designation sufix Z is also supplied greased  
They are illed with high-quality grease 
(table 3) under clean conditions 
The relatively large quantity of grease in 
the bearings means they can be operated for 
long periods before relubrication is required  
SKF recommends SKF LGWA 2 grease 
(table 3), if relubrication is required

Shaft and housing 
tolerances
The following tables provide tolerance 
classes to obtain suitable its and an appropriate operating clearance (page 598) for 
the following bearings:
• drawn cup needle roller bearings
• needle roller bearings with machined 
• alignment needle roller bearings
• combined needle roller bearings
Shaft and housing raceway tolerances significantly inluence the operating clearance of 
needle roller and cage assemblies and needle roller bearings with a machined outer 
ring (without an inner ring) and, therefore, 
are provided under Operating clearance, 
page 598.
For additional information about raceways, refer to Raceways on shafts and in 
housings, page 179.
Drawn cup needle roller bearings
Suitable tolerance classes for the housing 
bore and shaft for bearings with or without 
an inner ring are provided in table 16.
Needle roller bearings with 
machined rings
• Suitable tolerance classes for the shaft for 
bearings with machined inner and outer 
rings are provided in table 18.
• Housing seat tolerances for standard conditions are provided in table 8, page 151.

2) The envelope requirement (symbol  from ISO 14405-1) is not shown but applies to all tolerance classes 
3) The geometrical tolerance in accordance with ISO 1101 for the housing bore of drawn cup needle roller bearings must correspond 
to IT5/2 tolerance grade 
Alignment needle roller bearings
Suitable tolerance classes for the housing 
bore and shaft for bearings with or without 
an inner ring are provided in table 16 
Combined needle roller bearings
Suitable tolerance classes for the housing 
bore and shaft for bearings with or without 
an inner ring are provided in table 17 


Drawn cup and alignment needle roller 
bearings should be pressed into the housing 
bore using a mounting dolly (ig. 42)  An 
O-ring provides a simple means of retaining 
the bearing on the mounting dolly  The 
stamped side (side face with the designation) 
should abut the lange of the mounting dolly.
Special care should be taken to prevent 
the bearing from skewing or tilting when it is 
being pressed into the housing. Otherwise 
the rollers and raceways could easily be 
damaged.
For grease lubricated bearings, the bearing should be lubricated prior to mounting.
Paired mounting
If bearings are to be mounted immediately 
adjacent to each other, the load should be 
shared equally by both bearings. Therefore, 
the following need to be considered:
• Full complement needle roller arrangements should incorporate rollers of the 
same gauge.
• Needle roller and cage assemblies should 
incorporate rollers of the same gauge
• Drawn cup needle roller bearings should 
have the same deviations from the nominal inside diameter Fw.
A delivery of needle rollers of the same 
nominal diameter may contain packages of 
one or more gauges. The gauge limits are 
also printed on the package.
For needle roller and cage assemblies, the 
deviation from the nominal dimensions of 
the itted needle rollers is printed on the 
package 
For additional information about gauges 
and inside diameter, refer to Tolerances,

Lubrication                                    239
Tapered roller bearings have tapered inner 
and outer ring raceways as well as tapered 
rollers  They are designed to accommodate 
combined loads, i e  simultaneously acting 
radial and axial loads  The projection lines of 
the raceways meet at a common point on 
the bearing axis (apex point A, ig. 1) to provide a true rolling action and therefore low 
frictional moments during operation  The 
axial load carrying capacity of tapered roller 
bearings increases with increasing contact 
angle α  The size of the contact angle, which 
is usually between 10° and 30°, is related to 
the calculation factor e (product tables, 
page 694): the larger the value of e, the 
larger the contact angle 
conditions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
Selecting internal clearance or 
Contact angle projection lines meet at 
apex point A on the bearing axis

• Low friction
The optimized roller end design and surface inish on the lange (ig. 2) promote 
lubricant ilm formation, resulting in lower 
friction. This also reduces frictional heat 
and lange wear. In addition, the bearings 
can better maintain preload and run at 
reduced noise levels.
The crowned raceway proiles of basic 
design bearings and the logarithmic raceway proiles of SKF Explorer bearings optimize the load distribution along the contact surfaces, reduce stress peaks at the 
roller ends (ig. 3), and reduce the sensitivity to misalignment and shaft delection 
compared with conventional straight raceway proiles (ig. 4).
• Enhanced operational reliability
Optimized surface inish on the contact 
surfaces of the rollers and raceways supports the formation of a hydrodynamic 
lubricant ilm.

• Consistency of roller proiles and sizes
The rollers incorporated in SKF tapered 
roller bearings are manufactured to such 
close dimensional and geometrical tolerances that they are practically identical  
This provides optimal load distribution, 
reduces noise and vibration, and enables 
preload to be set more accurately 
• Rigid bearing application
A single row tapered roller bearing is typically adjusted against a second tapered 
roller bearing  By applying a preload, a 
rigid bearing application can be achieved 
• Running-in period with reduced temperature peaks
Tapered roller bearings typically have a 
running-in period, during which a conventional design tapered roller bearing ex periences a signiicant amount of friction, 
resulting in wear  This effect is noticed as a 
temperature spike (diagram 1)  With SKF 
tapered roller bearing designs, friction, 
frictional heat and wear are signiicantly 
reduced, provided the bearings are 
mounted and lubricated correctly 
• Separable and interchangeable
Depending on the design, tapered roller 
bearings are separable and components 
of same-sized bearings are fully interchangeable  For example, single row 
tapered roller bearings are separable 
(ig. 5), i e  the inner ring with roller and 
cage assembly (cone) can be mounted 
separately from the outer ring (cup)  This 
facilitates mounting, dismounting and also 
maintenance inspection routines 
SKF manufactures tapered roller bearings in 
many designs, series and sizes  In addition to 
the bearings presented in this catalogue, 
SKF supplies tapered roller bearings for special application requirements  This assortment includes:
• Four-row tapered roller bearings 
• hub units for industrial, automotive, railway and off-highway applications

tapered roller bearings for various operating 
conditions to meet the customer and application requirements

Single row tapered 
SKF single row tapered roller bearings 
(ig. 6) are available in many designs and 
variants and in many series and sizes, 
including:
• basic design bearings
• application-speciic bearings
• bearings with a langed outer ring
• SKF Explorer bearings (page 675)
• have a design and internal geometry that 
provide long service life
• have crowned raceway proiles and an 
optimized surface inish of the inner ring 
guide lange that enables them to run 
cooler and consume less lubricant than 
conventional design bearings
• have load rating values that are in accordance with ISO and even above (product 
tables, page 762)
• offer a cost-effective solution for standard 
industrial applications
On request, SKF can also supply any inner 
ring with roller and cage assembly (cone) or 
any outer ring (cup) separately (ig. 7) 
Application-speciic bearings
For applications where the bearings are subjected to unique operating conditions, SKF 
manufactures customized single row 
tapered roller bearings on request  To meet 
the needs of these particular applications, 
SKF manufactures, for example, pinion or 
low-friction bearings with the following 
features: 
Single row tapered roller bearing
Pinion bearings
• are designed for pinion shafts in the differentials of automotive transmissions to 
provide a constant, accurate gear mesh
• have very narrow geometrical tolerances 
and high preload capability
• have special friction characteristics and 
can be axially adjusted within narrow 
 limits using the friction-torque method
• have an internal design that supports the 
formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant ilm 
to substantially reduce friction, and consequently the operating temperature, during 
the running-in period
• retain their preload setting when 
mounted, lubricated and maintained 
properly
• are identiied by the designation sufix 
CL7C
Low-friction bearings
• are designed to meet the ever-increasing 
demands to reduce friction and energy 
use
• optimize a reduction in friction through 
their internal geometry, number of rollers, 
surface inish and redesign of their cage
• have a frictional moment that is at least 
30% lower when compared with a samesized SKF standard bearing
• normally do not need a running-in procedure because their optimized contact proiles provide optimum load distribution 
and they experience only a small, controlled loss of initial preload
• generate less frictional heat and therefore 
enable extended lubrication intervals or 
operation at higher speeds
• have a roller and cage assembly with a 
lower mass and therefore reduced inertial 
forces in the bearing, which reduce the risk 
of skidding and smearing
• are typically used in automotive and 
industrial transmissions
Separately packed components
669


Matched bearings arranged 
back-to-back
• have load lines that diverge toward the 
bearing axis (ig. 11)
• provide a relatively stiff bearing 
• can accommodate tilting moments
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
• are supplied with intermediate inner and 
outer ring spacers as a set
Bearings with a langed 
SKF also manufactures certain sizes of single row tapered roller bearings with a lange 
on the outer ring (ig. 8)  These bearings are 
easy to locate axially in the housing  The 
housing bore can be manufactured more 
easily and more cost-effectively because 
housing shoulders are not required 
Matched tapered 
The SKF assortment of matched single row 
tapered roller bearings (ig. 9) is based on 
popular sizes of single row tapered roller 
bearings  Depending on the application 
requirements, matched tapered roller bearings are available in different designs and 
variants:
• matched bearings arranged face-to-face
• matched bearings arranged back-to-back
• matched bearings arranged in tandem
• basic design and SKF Explorer bearings 
(page 675)
The matched bearings listed in the product 
tables constitute the basic SKF assortment  
SKF can supply other matched bearings on 
request  
Depending on the design, matched bearings can locate the shaft axially in both directions with a speciic axial clearance or 
preload  Also depending on the design, these 
bearings can provide a relatively stiff bearing 
The bearings and ring spacer(s) are 
matched in production, are delivered as a set 
and are ready-to-mount  
Matched bearings arranged 
face-to-face
• have load lines that converge toward the 
bearing axis (ig. 10)
• can accommodate a limited amount of 
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
• are supplied with an intermediate outer 
ring spacer as a set
Matched bearings arranged back-to-back
Bearing with a langed outer ring
Matched single row tapered roller 
Matched bearings arranged face-to-face


Matched bearings arranged 
in tandem
• have load lines that are parallel (ig. 12)
• share radial and axial loads equally
• are used when the load carrying capacity 
of a single bearing is inadequate
• can accommodate axial loads in one direction only 
If axial loads act in both directions, a 
third bearing must be added and adjusted 
against the tandem pair 
• are supplied with intermediate inner and 
outer ring spacers as a set
Double row tapered 
SKF manufactures double row tapered roller 
bearings in the TDO (ig. 13) and TDI (ig. 14) 
designs, in many variants and with different 
features  
Depending on the design, these bearings 
can accommodate heavy radial loads, axial 
loads in both directions and have a high 
degree of stiffness  Therefore, they provide a 
stiff bearing arrangement and locate the 
shaft in both directions with a speciic axial 
clearance or preload  Because of their second row of rollers, double row tapered roller 
bearings are suitable for heavy radial and 
axial loads  
Double row tapered roller bearings are 
typically used in gearboxes, hoisting equipment, rolling mills and machines in the mining industry, e g  tunnelling machines 
Matched bearings arranged in tandem
TDO design bearings
• have one double row outer ring (double 
cup) and two inner rings with roller and 
cage assemblies (cones), usually with an 
intermediate ring between the two inner 
rings (ig. 13) 
• have rows of rollers arranged back-toback (load lines diverge toward the bearing 
axis), which enable stiff arrangements and 
accommodate considerable tilting 
moments
• are ready-to-mount units, manufactured 
with the predetermined axial clearance or 
• can be used either as locating or non- 
locating bearings:
 – for non-locating arrangements, the 
axial displacement should take place 
between the outer ring and the housing 
bore
 – bearings with a blind hole or locating 
slot in the outer ring can be used with a 
cylindrical pin engaged in the hole or 
slot to prevent the outer ring from turning in its seat
SKF manufactures TDO design bearings in 
many variants (table 1, page 672) 
671


TDI design bearings
• have two outer rings (cups) and one  
double row inner ring with two roller and 
cage assemblies (double cone), usually 
with an intermediate ring between the two 
outer rings (ig. 14, page 671)
• have rows of rollers arranged face-to-face 
(load lines converge toward the bearing 
axis)
• are available open or capped with shields 
or seals 
 – HNBR or FKM contact seal on both sides
• are ready-to-mount units, manufactured 
with the predetermined axial clearance or 
• are designed primarily for use as locating 
• are available with a helical groove in the 
bore and/or lubrication grooves in the side 
faces of the bearing rings (ig. 15): 
 – where a loose it on the shaft is needed, 
these grooves counteract the disadvantage of a loose it
 – when the inner ring turns on its seat 
under load, these grease-illed grooves 
enable lubricant to be supplied between 
the inner ring and seat surfaces
 – in addition, the grooves can absorb 
wear particles

On request, TDI design bearings with dimensions different from those listed in the TDI 
design product table can be specially created 
as tailored double row bearings using standard components of SKF four-row tapered 
roller bearings in the TQO design, but without intermediate rings (TQO design, 
skf com/go/17000-8-9). For example, it is 
possible to combine standard components 
as follows (ig. 16): 
• two single row outer rings (cups)
• one double row inner ring (double cone)
• two roller and cage assemblies
This option may be advantageous as regards 
both price and delivery time and should be 
considered if sealed double row bearings are 
required, although this will require a 
non-standard inner ring. For details about 
this option, contact the SKF application 
engin eering service.

Calculating the axial 
load for bearings 
mounted singly or 
paired in tandem
When a radial load is applied to a single row 
tapered roller bearing, the load is transmitted from one raceway to the other at an 
angle to the bearing axis and an internal 
axial load is induced. This should be considered when calculating the equivalent 
bearing loads for bearing applications consisting of two single bearing arrangements 
and/or bearing pairs arranged in tandem.
Necessary equations for various bearing 
applications and load cases are provided in 
table 7, page 682. The equations are valid 
under the following conditions:
• the bearings are adjusted against each 
other to practically zero clearance, but 
without any preload
• bearing A is subjected to a radial load FrA 
and bearing B to a radial load FrB
• both FrA and FrB are always considered 
positive, even when they act in a direction 
opposite to that shown in the igures
• the radial loads act at the pressure centres 
of the bearings (distance a, refer to product tables, page 694)
Ka is the external axial force acting on the 
shaft or on the housing  Load cases 1c and 
2c are also valid when Ka = 0. 
Values of the calculation factor Y are listed 
in the product tables.

Calculating the radial 
load acting on 
matched bearings 
When matched tapered roller bearings, 
arranged face-to-face or back-to-back, are 
mounted together with a third bearing, the 
bearing arrangement is statically indetermin- 
ate. In these cases, the radial load Fr acting 
on the bearing pair must be calculated irst 
Matched bearings arranged 
face-to-face
For matched bearings, where two bearings 
are arranged face-to-face (ig. 19), it can be 
assumed that the radial load acts at the 
geometric centre of the matched bearings, 
as the distance between the pressure  
centres of the two bearings is short when 
compared with the distance between the 
geometric centres of the set and the other 
bearing  In this case, it can be assumed that 
the bearing arrangement is statically 
determined 
Matched bearings arranged face-to-face, 
radial load
683


Matched bearings arranged 
back-to-back
The distance a between the pressure centres 
of two matched bearings arranged back-toback is signiicant when compared with the 
distance L between the geometric centres of 
the matched bearings and the other bearing 
(ig. 20)  Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the magnitude of the load acting on the 
bearing pair and also the distance a1 at 
which the load acts. The magnitude of the 
radial load can be obtained using:

L1
Fr = JKK Kr

L – a1
Fr = radial load acting on a bearing pair [kN]
Kr = radial force acting on the shaft [kN]
L =  distance between the geometric centres 
of the two bearing positions [mm]
L1 =  distance between the centre of bearing 
position I and the point of action of the 
force Kr [mm] 
a =  distance between the bearing pressure 
centres [mm] (product table, page 754)
a1 =  distance between the geometric centre 
of the matched bearings and the point 
of action of the radial load Fr [mm]
• diagram 2 
• calculation factor Y2, product table 
The distance a1 can be determined from 
diagram 2 by making an initial assumption for Fr and if necessary followed by 
several iterative calculations.

Comparative load 
ratings for double 
row tapered roller 
For rolling mill applications, load ratings are 
not necessarily calculated according to 
ISO 281  Instead, they are often calculated 
by a different method based on a rating life 
of 90 million revolutions (500 r/min for 
3 000 operating hours)  Therefore, for  
double row tapered roller bearings these 
comparative load ratings are provided in the 
product tables because a direct comparison 
between the comparative and ISO load ratings is not possible, even if the comparative 
ratings are converted for 1 million revolutions (ISO life deinition) 
These comparative load ratings may not 
be used to calculate an ISO rating life  They 
may only be used together with the compara- 
tive rating life and equivalent load equations 
speciied as follows:
or 
LF10 =  comparative rating life [million 
revolutions]
LF10h =  comparative rating life [operating 
hours]
CF 
=  comparative dynamic load rating to 
give a rating life of 90 million revolutions [kN] (product tables, 
page 762) 
PF 
=  comparative equivalent dynamic 
bearing load [kN] (table 8,

Single row and 
matched tapered 
Single row tapered roller bearings must be 
used either with a second bearing (ig. 21) or 
as a matched pair (ig. 10, page 670, and 
ig. 11, page 670). The bearings must be 
adjusted against each other until the requisite clearance or preload is obtained (Selecting preload, page 186).
When the operating clearance in a bearing 
arrangement is too large, the load carrying 
capacity of both bearings cannot be fully 
utilized. Excessive preload increases friction, 
which increases the amount of frictional heat 
and reduces bearing service life.
Adjustment procedure
When adjusting tapered roller bearings 
against each other, the bearings must be 
rotated so that the rollers assume their correct position, i.e. the large end face of the 
rollers must be in contact with the guide 
lange  
Fits
Inch bearings
In contrast to metric bearings, which are 
machined to a minus tolerance, inch bearings are machined to a plus tolerance 
(table 9, page 45)  Therefore, the deviations for shaft and housing diameters for 
metric bearings are not applicable  Suitable 
shaft and housing its for inch tapered roller 
bearings are provided in table 9, page 688, 
and table 10, page 689  These its are valid 
for bearings with Normal tolerances in typical applications 
The axial internal clearance of matched 
bearings arranged face-to-face or back-toback (table 6, page 679) provides an appropriate operating clearance when the bearings are mounted on shafts machined to:
• d ≤ 50 mm 
→ m5
• 50 mm < d ≤ 140 mm 
→ m6
• 140 mm < d ≤ 200 mm → n6
• d > 200 mm 
→ p6
SKF recommends these shaft seat tolerance 
classes for rotating loads on the inner ring 
where P ≤ 0,06 C  If tighter its are selected, 
be sure that the bearings are not preloaded 
and are able to rotate freely  The reduction of 
internal clearance caused by axial locating 
forces should also be taken into consideration 
For stationary outer ring loads, SKF recommends housing bore tolerance classes

Double row tapered 
Depending on their design, components of 
double row tapered roller bearings can also 
be mounted separately. The individual rings 
of one bearing must be mounted in the correct order and position. They must also not 
be mixed with those of another bearing 
when several bearings are mounted at the 
same time. Therefore, some precautions 
have been taken to ease mounting:
• Components of one bearing are marked 
with letters that indicate their correct 
order and position (ig. 22).
• All components of one bearing are marked 
with the same serial number.
Special care should be taken not to deform 
or compress the relatively thin-walled intermediate rings when mounting smaller TDI 
design bearings. This can happen, for ex -
ample, when tightening the cover screws 
and can have a negative impact on the axial 
clearance or the preload. Therefore, SKF 
recommends applying a cover with a centring 
spigot that is appropriate to the widths of the 
bearing and the housing seat. 
If the knowledge and experience required 
to mount double row tapered roller bearings 
is unavailable, especially where large bearings are concerned, SKF recommends that 
the assistance of SKF service personnel be 
requested. Further details of the SKF 
mounting service are available on request.
Fig. 22
Components are marked with letters that 
indicate their correct order and position
Load zone
In the majority of rolling mill applications, 
the direction of a radial load is constant. 
Depending on the ratio between axial and 
radial loads, usually only approximately one 
quarter of the outer ring raceway is under 
load. Therefore (ig. 23):
• Outer rings are divided into four zones 
identiied by a marking I to IV on the outer 
ring side faces, on request 
• Markings for zone I are also joined by a 
line across the outside surface 
• For initial mounting, zone I (line across the 
outside surface) should be positioned in 
the direction of the load 
• Depending on the operating conditions, 
after a period of service the outer rings 
should be turned through 90° so that a 
new (the next) zone becomes the loaded 
zone.

Bearing designations
designations
Metric bearings
The designations of metric tapered roller 
bearings follow one of the following 
principles:
• The series designations in accordance with 
ISO 355 consist of a digit and two letters  
The digit represents the contact angle  The 
two letters represent the diameter and 
width series, respectively  This is followed 
by a three-digit bore diameter d [mm]  The 
basic designations of SKF tapered roller 
bearings start with the letter T, e g  
T2ED 045 
• Designations established prior to 1977 are 
based on the system shown under Basic 
designations, page 31, e g  32206 
(table 4, page 30) 
• Metric bearings with the designation preix 
J follow the ABMA designation system, 
which is used for inch bearings (ANSI/
ABMA Std  19 1) 
Inch bearings
Inch tapered roller bearing designations are 
in accordance with ANSI/ABMA Std  19 2 
Within a series:
• roller and cage assemblies are equal but 
the inner and outer rings can have different sizes and designs
• any inner ring with roller and cage assembly (cone) can be assembled with any 
outer ring (cup)
General:
• Cup and cone have individual designations 
and can be supplied separately (ig. 24) 
• The designations of cups and cones, as 
well as the series, consist of a three- to 
six-digit number, which may be preixed to 
characterize a bearing series from extralight to extra-heavy 
• The complete bearing designation is an 
abbreviated combination of cone and cup 
designations  It consists of the cone designation followed by the complete or parts 
of the cup designation, separated by an 
oblique stroke (table 11)

DB..
Two bearings matched for mounting back-to-back. A number immediately following the 
DB identiies the design of the ring spacers. 
DF..
Two bearings matched for mounting face-to-face. A number immediately following the 
DF identiies the design of the ring spacer. 
DT..
Two bearings matched for mounting in tandem. A number immediately following the DT 
identiies the design of the ring spacers. 
C...
Special clearance
The two- or three-digit number immediately following the C is the mean axial internal 
clearance in μm. The range remains the same as speciied in table 6, page 679. 
In addition to their designation, double row bearings are also identiied by their design variants/features (product tables, page 762).  Some of these  
features may not be part of the bearing designation, but are always part of the design variants/features (Variants/features, page 674).

9 Spherical roller bearings


Spherical roller bearings have two rows of 
symmetrical rollers, a common sphered 
outer ring raceway and two inner ring raceways inclined at an angle to the bearing axis 
(ig. 1)  The centre point of the sphere in the 
outer ring raceway is at the bearing axis 
• Accommodate misalignment
Spherical roller bearings are self-aligning 
like self-aligning ball bearings or CARB 
bearings (ig. 2) 
• High load carrying capacity
Spherical roller bearings are designed to 
accommodate both heavy radial loads and 
axial loads in both directions 
The rollers are manufactured to such tight 
dimensional and geometrical tolerances 
that they are practically identical in a roller 
set  The symmetrical rollers self-adjust 
(ig. 3), providing optimal load distribution 
along the roller length and together with 
the special proile prevent stress peaks at 
the roller ends (ig. 4) 
• Low friction
Self-guiding rollers keep friction and frictional heat at low levels (ig. 5)  A loating 
guide ring guides unloaded rollers so that 
they enter the load zone in the optimal 
position 
• Robust
All SKF spherical roller bearings contain 
strong window- or prong-type cages

• sealed bearings
• bearings for vibratory applications
• bearings for wind energy applications
All SKF spherical roller bearings are 
SKF Explorer bearings (page 7) and almost 
all bearings are available with the option of a 
tapered bore  Depending on the bearing 
series, the tapered bore has:
• a taper 1:12 (designation sufix K)
• a taper 1:30 (designation sufix K30)
For sizes and variants not listed in the 
 product tables, contact SKF.
CC, CA and E design 
CC design bearings

holes
• CC and CA design bearings are available 
with an annular groove and three lubri- 
cation holes in the outer ring (designation 
sufix W33) or three lubrication holes in 
the outer ring (designation sufix W20)
(ig. 7) 
• E design bearings have an annular groove 
and three lubrication holes as standard 
(ig. 6, page 775)  This feature is not identiied in the bearing designation (no designation sufix) 
• have the same features and internal 
design as open spherical roller bearings
• are available with a cylindrical bore as 
standard
• are supplied grease lubricated and should 
not be washed
• are equipped with an annular groove and 
three lubrication holes in the outer ring, 
except for those with the designation 
sufix W
• are itted with a contact seal, on one or 
both sides, made of one of the following 
materials:
 – sheet steel reinforced NBR (designation 
sufix CS or RS)
 – sheet steel reinforced HNBR (designation sufix CS5 or RS5)
 – sheet steel reinforced FKM (designation 
sufix CS2)
The seals are itted in a recess on the outer 
ring and seal against the inner ring (ig. 8)  
On larger bearings, the seals are ixed by a 
retaining ring (ig. 9) 
Bearings sealed on both sides are lubricated for the life of the bearing and are virtually maintenance-free (Grease life for 
sealed bearings)  They are illed with one of 
the following greases (table 1): 
• SKF LGEP 2 grease (designation sufix 
VT143) as standard
• SKF LGHB 2 grease (designation sufix 
GEM9) or LGWM 2 grease (designation 
sufix GLE) on request

Grease life for sealed bearings
The grease life for sealed bearings is presented as L10, i e  the time period at the end 
of which 90% of the bearings are  still reliably 
lubricated, and depends on the load, operating temperature and speed value  It can be 
obtained for bearings with standard SKF 
LGEP 2 grease (designation sufix VT143) 
from:
• diagram 1, for light load (P ≤ 0,067 C)
• diagram 2, page 778, for normal load 
(P ≤ 0,125 C)
The grease life is valid under the following 
operating conditions:
• horizontal shaft
• inner ring rotation
• operating temperature within the green 
temperature zone of the grease (table 1)
• stationary machine
• low vibration levels
• load ratio Fa/Fr ≤ e (product table,
page 792)
• rotational speed below the limiting speed 
(product table) and below the limits listed 
in table 2, page 778
For other operating conditions, the grease 
life can be estimated by multiplying the relubrication interval for open bearings (Estimating the relubrication interval for grease, 
page 111) by a factor of 2,7 
Seals ixed by a retaining ring
776


Relubrication of sealed bearings
When the required service life is longer than 
the grease life, the bearings may require 
relubrication  A suitable grease quantity to 
relubricate sealed bearings can be obtained 
using
Gp = 0,0015 D B
Gp = grease quantity [g] 
D = bearing outside diameter [mm] 
B = bearing width [mm] 
The grease should be applied slowly through 
the lubrication holes in the outer ring, preferably while the bearing is rotating to avoid 
damaging the seals. SKF recommends relubricating with the same grease as the initial 
ill 
Grease life for sealed spherical roller bearings with designation sufix VT143 where 
P ≤ 0,067 C

 WARNING
Seals made of FKM (luoro rubber) 
exposed to an open lame or temperatures above 300 °C (570 °F) are a health 
and environmental hazard! They remain 
dangerous even after they have cooled.

Vibrating screen
Bearings for vibratory applications
Acceleration 
Vibratory applications induce accelerations 
of the rollers and cages in the bearings  This 
puts extra demands on the bearing design  
SKF spherical roller bearings for vibratory 
applications can withstand considerably 
higher accelerations than corresponding 
standard bearings  The permissible acceleration depends on the lubricant and the mode 
of acceleration 
• Mode 1
The bearing is subjected to a rotating 
outer ring load in combination with a 
rotating acceleration ield, or an internally 
induced angular acceleration ield caused 
by rapid speed variations  These acceler- 
ations cause the unloaded rollers to generate cyclic loads on the cages  Examples: 
vibrating screens (ig. 11), exciters, planetary gears and general arrangements 
subjected to rapid starts or rapid speed 
variations  
• Mode 2
The bearing is subjected to impact loads, 
which generate a linear acceleration in a 
constant radial direction, causing the 
unloaded rollers to “hammer” the cage 
pockets  Example: acceleration generated 
when rail wheels roll over rail joints 
(ig. 12) 
Road rollers, where the roller is vibrating 
against a relatively hard surface, are subjected to a combination of mode 1 and 2 
acceleration  Values for the permissible 
acceleration are listed in the product table, 
page 792, and are valid for oil lubricated 
bearings  The values are expressed in 
 multiples of g, where g is the acceleration of 
gravity (g = 9,81 m/s2) 

 WARNING
PTFE coatings exposed to an open lame 
or temperatures above 300 °C (570 °F) 
are a health and environmental hazard! 
They remain dangerous even after they 
have cooled

continuous casters
• bearings for high-speed applications
• mounting with loose it on roll necks
• railway vehicles
Bearings for highspeed applications
• have 50% higher limiting speeds than 
standard bearings
• are available in the 223, 232, 240 and 241 
series in a special execution
• are identiied by the designation sufix 
VA991
• address a market need in multi-megawatt 
industrial gearboxes

† page 182
Normal, C3
Check availability of C2, C4 or C5 clearance classes
Bearings for vibratory applications: C4
Values:
• cylindrical bore (table 4, page 782)
• tapered bore (table 5, page 783)
Values are in accordance with ISO 5753-1 (as far as standardized) and are valid for unmounted bearings 
under zero measuring load 
• Guideline values for light to normal loads (P ≤ 0,1 C) and constant position of misalignment relative to 
the outer ring: table 6 
Whether these values can be fully exploited depends on the design of the bearing arrangement, the 
bearing abutments in the housing, etc 
• When the position of the misalignment is not constant relative to the outer ring, additional sliding may 
occur in the bearing, limiting misalignment to a few tenths of a degree  Examples are: 
 – vibrating screens with rotating imbalance and therefore rotating delection of the shaft (ig. 14)
 – delection-compensating rolls of paper machines where the stationary shaft is not straight 
• To avoid detrimental effects on sealing performance, misalignment for sealed bearings should not 
exceed 0,5°

9 Spherical roller bearings
Free space on both 
sides of the bearing
To prevent interference between rotating 
bearing parts and stationary machine parts, 
free space (Ca) should be provided as indicated in ig. 15  The requisite width of the 
free space depends on: 
• the actual misalignment
• lubricant space requirements
The requisite free space should be at least 
20 times the minimum value of the radial 
internal clearance in the unmounted 
bearing:
• with a cylindrical bore (table 4, page 782)
• with a tapered bore (table 5, page 783)
Abutments for sealed 
The diameter of the shaft abutment should 
not exceed da max (product table, page 792), 
certainly for the 1 to 2 mm closest to the 
bearing, to prevent interference with the seal 
(ig. 16). If the bearings are to be located 
axially on the shaft by a lock nut, SKF recommends using a KMFE lock nut (ig. 17) or 
itting a spacer ring (ig. 18) between the 
bearing and the lock washer to prevent 
interference with the seal.

Bearings on sleeves
Spherical roller bearings with a tapered bore 
can be mounted with:
• an adapter sleeve on plain or stepped 
shafts (ig. 19):
 – SKF adapter sleeves are supplied complete with a locking device 
 – Use appropriate SKF adapter sleeve 
assemblies for sealed bearings (ig. 20) 
to prevent the locking device interfering 
with the seal (product table, page 824)  
Alternatively, a spacer ring can be 
inserted between the bearing and the 
lock washer 
• a withdrawal sleeve on stepped shafts 
(ig. 21)
For additional information about sleeves, 
refer to Adapter sleeves, page 1065, and 
Withdrawal sleeves, page 1087

9 Spherical roller bearings
Appropriate bearing 
housings
The combination of a spherical roller bearing, appropriate sleeve (where needed), and 
an appropriate SKF bearing housing provides a cost-effective, interchangeable and 
reliable solution that fulils the demand for 
easy maintenance  
The comprehensive assortment of SKF 
bearing housings is provided online at 
skf com/housings 
During handling, the rings and roller complement of spherical roller bearings may be 
axially displaced from their normal position  
This is especially likely where the bearings 
are mounted with the shaft or housing in the 
vertical position:
• The roller complement, together with the 
inner or outer ring, will move downward 
and result in no more clearance 
• When the bearing rings expand or contract as a result of an interference it, 
preload is likely to result 
Therefore, wherever possible:
• Mount spherical roller bearings with the 
shaft or housing in the horizontal position 
• Rotate the inner or outer ring to align the 
rollers during mounting 
Where this is not feasible, use a bearing 
handling tool or other device to keep the 
bearing components arranged centrally 
Mounting sealed bearings
SKF does not recommend heating sealed 
spherical roller bearings above 80 °C 
(175 °F) during the mounting process  However, if higher temperatures are necessary, 
make sure that the temperature does not 
exceed the permissible temperature of either 
the seal or grease, whichever is the lowest 
Mounting bearings with a tapered 
bore
Bearings with a tapered bore are mounted 
with an interference it  To obtain the proper 
degree of interference, one of the following 
methods can be used:
1 Measuring the clearance reduction 
(table 7)
2 Measuring the lock nut tightening angle 
(table 7)
3 Measuring the axial drive-up (table 7)
4 Applying the SKF Drive-up Method
For bearings with d > 100 mm, SKF recommends using the SKF Drive-up 
Method  This is a fast, reliable and safe 
method to achieve the appropriate interference it  Additional information is available online at skf com/drive-up 
5 Measuring the inner ring expansion 
Additional information is available online 
at skf com/sensormount  

For additional information about these 
mounting methods, refer to Mounting bearings with a tapered bore, page 203, or the 
SKF bearing main tenance handbook

Applying the recommended  
values prevents the inner ring 
from creeping, but does not 
ensure correct radial internal 
clearance in operation  Additional 
inluences from the bearing 
housing it and temperature 
differences between the inner 
and outer rings must be considered carefully when selecting the 
bearing radial internal clearance

10 CARB toroidal roller bearings


CARB toroidal roller bearings (ig. 1) have 
one row of long, slightly barrel-shaped symmetrical rollers and torus-shaped raceway 
proiles (ig. 2). They are non-locating bearings and accommodate exclusively radial 
loads. CARB bearings are often used to 
replace the non-locating spherical roller 
bearing in a locating/non-locating bearing 
arrangement.
• Accommodate misalignment
CARB bearings are self-aligning like 
spherical roller bearings or self-aligning 
ball bearings (ig. 3).
• Accommodate axial displacement
CARB bearings compensate for thermal 
expansion of the shaft like cylindrical or 
needle roller bearings (ig. 4).
• Wide assortment of dimension series
CARB bearings are available with the 
same boundary dimensions as corres- 
ponding spherical roller bearings, 
self-aligning ball bearings, cylindrical 
roller bearings and needle roller bearings 
(ig. 5).
The special roller proile prevents stress 
peaks at the roller ends (ig. 6).
• Low friction
Self-guiding rollers keep friction and frictional heat at low levels (ig. 7).
• Improved wear resistance
All CARB bearings are upgraded SKF
Explorer bearings (page 7).
• Low noise
CARB bearings can reduce noise and 
vibration levels, for example, in paper
machines and fans.

Self-aligning bearing arrangement: Locating spherical roller bearing and non-locating CARB 
Long bearing system life
CARB bearings provide beneits in 
self-aligning bearing arrangements (ig. 8). 
With a CARB bearing in the non-locating 
position, there are no internally induced axial 
forces, which results in multiple beneits:
• Less load extends the service life.
• The bearings run cooler, the lubricant lasts 
longer and maintenance intervals can be 
extended.
• Noise and vibration levels can be reduced.

bearing arrangement in the video available 
at skf.com/go/17000-10 (4 min).

Permissible axial displacement
CARB bearings can be limited by: 
Bearing rings
The rings of CARB bearings are heat stabil- 
ized up to 200 °C (390 °F).
Steel or brass cages can be used at the same 
operating temperatures as the bearing rings. 
For temperature limits of polymer cages, 
refer to Polymer cages, page 188.
seals depends on the seal material:
• HNBR: –40 to +150 °C (–40 to +300 °F)
• NBR: –40 to +90 °C (–40 to +195 °F)
Temperatures up to 120 °C (250 °F) can 
be tolerated for brief periods 
Typically, temperature peaks are at the seal 
lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in 
sealed CARB bearings are provided in 
table 1, page 845  For temperature limits of 
other SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable SKF grease, page 116

10 CARB toroidal roller bearings
Free space on both 
sides of the bearing
To enable axial displacement of the shaft 
relative to the housing, free space must be 
provided on both sides of the bearing as 
indicated in ig. 13  The value for the width of 
this free space is based on:
• the value Ca (product table, page 856)
• the expected axial displacement of the 
bearing rings from the central position 
during operation
• the displacement of the rings caused by 
Calculating the free space required on 
both sides of the bearing 
Careq = Ca + 0,5 (s + β k1 B) 
= bearing width [mm]
=  minimum width of space required on 
both sides of the bearing [mm] 
(product table)
Careq =  width of space required on both sides 
of the bearing [mm]
k1 
= misalignment factor (product table)
=  relative axial displacement of rings, 
e g  thermal shaft expansion [mm]
β 
= misaligment [°]
Offset mounting
Where considerable thermal changes in 
shaft length are a possibility, the inner ring 
can be mounted offset, relative to the outer 
ring, up to the axial displacement limit s1 or 
s2 (ig. 11, page 850) in the direction oppos- 
ite to the expected axial displacement 
(ig. 14)  The extended permissible axial displacement is used, for example, in the 
self-aligning bearing arrangements of drying cylinders in paper machines 
Bearings on sleeves
CARB bearings with a tapered bore can be 
mounted with:
• an adapter sleeve on plain or stepped 
shafts (ig. 15):
 – Adapter sleeves are supplied complete 
with a locking device 
 – Use appropriate SKF adapter sleeve 
assemblies to prevent the locking device 
from interfering with the cage 
(product table, page 868) 
• a withdrawal sleeve on stepped shafts 
(ig. 16)
Check axial displacement carefully, as it could 
be that s1 (product table, page 856) cannot 
be fully realized 
For additional information about sleeves, 
refer to Adapter sleeves, page 1065, and 
Withdrawal sleeves, page 1087  
Free space to enable axial displacement
Bearing rings mounted offset to accommodate shaft expansion
Appropriate bearing 
housings
SKF standard bearing housings are available 
for most CARB bearings in the C 30, C 31, 
C 22 and C 23 series 
The two common arrangements when 
using standard housings are:
• CARB bearings with a tapered bore on an 
adapter sleeve and a plain shaft
• CARB bearings with a cylindrical bore on a 
stepped shaft
The comprehensive assortment of SKF 
bearing housings is provided online at 
skf com/housings

Bearing with a withdrawal sleeve
Bearings with an adapter sleeve
On a plain shaft
On a stepped shaft
During handling, the rings and roller complement of CARB toroidal roller bearings 
may be axially displaced from their normal 
position  This is especially likely where CARB 
bearings are mounted with the shaft or 
housing in the vertical position:
1 The roller complement, together with the 
inner or outer ring, will move downward 
and result in no more clearance 
2 When the bearing rings expand or contract as a result of an interference it, 
preload is likely to result.
Therefore, wherever possible:
• Mount CARB bearings with the shaft or 
housing in the horizontal position.
• Rotate the inner or outer ring to align the 
rollers during mounting.
Where this is not feasible, use a bearing 
handling tool or other device to keep the 
bearing components arranged centrally.
Mounting bearings 
with a tapered bore
Bearings with a tapered bore are mounted 
with an interference it, by using one of the 
following methods: 
1 Measuring the clearance reduction 
(table 5, page 854)
2 Measuring the lock nut tightening angle 
(table 5)
3 Measuring the axial drive-up (table 5)
4 Applying the SKF Drive-up Method
For bearings with d > 100 mm, SKF recommends using the SKF Drive-up 
Method. This is a fast, reliable and safe 
method to achieve the appropriate interference it. Additional information is available online at skf.com/drive-up.
5 Measuring the inner ring expansion
Additional information is available online 
at skf.com/sensormount.
For additional information about these 
mounting methods, refer to Mounting bearings with a tapered bore, page 203, or the 
SKF bearing maintenance handbook.

Applying the recommended values  
prevents the inner ring from 
creeping, but does not ensure correct radial internal clearance in 
operation  Additional inluences 
from the bearing housing it and 
temperature differences between 
the inner and outer rings must be 
considered carefully when selecting 
the bearing radial internal clearance class (Selecting initial internal 
clearance, page 183).

2) The listed values are valid only for solid steel shafts and general applications. They are to be used as guideline values only, as it is dificult to establish an exact starting position.  
Also, the axial drive-up, s, differs slightly between the different bearings series.

11 Cylindrical roller thrust 


SKF cylindrical roller thrust bearings (ig. 1) 
are designed to accommodate heavy axial 
loads and impact loads  They must not be 
subjected to any radial load  The bearings 
are very stiff and require little axial space 
• Separable design
Shaft washer, housing washer, cylindrical 
roller and cage thrust assembly can be 
mounted separately  
• Extended bearing service life
To prevent stress peaks, the roller ends 
are relieved slightly to modify the line contact between the raceway and rollers 
Cylindrical roller thrust bearing
878
11 Cylindrical roller thrust 


SKF supplies cylindrical roller thrust bearings in different series (ig. 2):
• 811 and 812 series bearings with one row 
of rollers
They are mainly used in applications 
where thrust ball bearings do not have 
suficient load carrying capacity 
• 893 and 894 series bearings with two 
rows of rollers
Single direction 
As standard, cylindrical roller thrust bearings 
are available as single direction bearings 
(ig. 2) and can accommodate axial loads in 
one direction only 
Single direction bearings
Double direction bearings
Double direction 
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
• can be created by combining two cylindrical 
roller and cage thrust assemblies and two 
bearing washers with an intermediate 
Depending on the design, an intermediate washer can be shaft or housing centred (ig. 3) 
Intermediate washers must have the same 
surface inish and hardness as bearing 
washers  SKF does not supply intermediate 
washers, but provides material speciications 
and dimensional data on request 
For additional information, refer to Design 
considerations, page 885

11 Cylindrical roller thrust bearings
Cylindrical roller and 
cage thrust 
assemblies
• are identiied by the preix K (ig. 4)
• can accommodate axial loads in one direction only
• can be combined with washers in the WS, 
GS and LS series (Bearing washers)
• can be used without washers in applications where:
 – adjacent components can serve as 
raceways
 – bearing arrangements with a low axial 
section height are required
Housing washers
• are identiied by the preix GS
• are made of hardened carbon chromium 
bearing steel
• have a precision-ground raceway surface
• have a ground outside surface
SKF recommends using both of these washers 
in high-speed applications where accurate 
centring of the bearing washers is required 
LS series universal washers
• can be used as both shaft or housing 
washers for bearings in the 811 series
• are used for applications where accurate 
centring of the bearing washers is not 
necessary
• are used where low speeds are involved
For additional information about LS series 
washers, refer to Needle roller thrust bearings, page 895

SKF can also supply the components of 
cylindrical roller thrust bearings also separ­
ately  Additional to cylindrical roller and cage 
thrust assemblies the included bearing 
washers (ig. 5) are listed in the product 
table, page 888) 
Shaft washers
• are identiied by the preix WS
• are made of hardened carbon chromium 
bearing steel
• have a precision-ground raceway surface
• have a ground bore

1) The envelope requirement (symbol  from ISO 14405-1) is not shown but applies to all tolerance classes.
Abutment 
Abutment dimensions should fulil the 
following:
• Support surfaces in housings and on 
shafts should be at right angles to the 
shaft axis and provide uninterrupted 
 support over the entire washer face.
• The abutment diameter on the shaft 
should be ≥ da min and in the housing 
≤ Da max (ig. 6). Values for da min and 
Da max are listed in the product table, 
page 888
• Shafts and housings should be manufactured to suitable tolerance classes 
(table 4) to provide satisfactory radial 
guidance for the individual thrust bearing 
components.
 – Housing centred washers require a 
radial gap between the shaft and 
washer bore.
 – Shaft centred washers require a radial 
gap between the washer and the housing bore.
Cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
are generally centred radially by the shaft to 
reduce the circumferential speed at which 
the cage slides against the guiding surface. 
This is particularly important for  higher- 
speed applications. The guiding surface 
should be ground.
Raceways on shafts 
and in housings
• should have the same hardness, surface 
inish and axial run-out as a bearing 
washer, if the load carrying capacity of a 
cylindrical roller and cage thrust assembly 
is to be fully exploited
• should be designed using the dimensions 
Ea and Eb (product table, page 888), 
which take radial displacement of the 
roller set into consideration
For additional information, refer to Raceways 
on shafts and in housings, page 179.

12 Needle roller thrust bearings


SKF needle roller thrust bearings are itted 
with a form-stable cage to reliably retain and 
guide a large number of needle rollers  
 Needle roller thrust bearings provide a high 
degree of stiffness within a minimum axial 
space  In applications where the faces of 
adjacent machine components can serve as 
raceways, needle roller thrust bearings take 
up no more space than a conventional thrust 
• Accommodate heavy axial loads and
peak loads
The very small diameter deviation of the 
rollers within one assembly enables these 
bearings to accommodate heavy axial 
loads and peak loads 
• Extended bearing service life
To prevent stress peaks, the roller ends 
are relieved slightly to modify the line 
contact between the raceway and rollers 
SKF supplies needle roller thrust bearings in 
two designs:
• needle roller and cage thrust assemblies, 
AXK series (ig. 1)
• needle roller thrust bearings with a centring lange, AXW series (ig. 2)
In applications where adjacent components 
cannot serve as raceways, the assemblies 
can be combined with bearing washers in 
different series (Bearing washers, 
page 898).

AXK series needle roller and cage thrust 
assemblies (ig. 1):
• are available for 4 ≤ d ≤ 160 mm
• can accommodate axial loads in one  
direction only
• can be combined with washers in the LS, 
AS, GS 811 or WS 811 series (Bearing 
washers, page 898) in applications where 
adjacent components cannot serve as 
raceways
Double direction 
Double direction bearings:
• can accommodate axial loads in both 
• can be created by combining two needle 
roller and cage thrust assemblies and two 
bearing washers with an intermediate 
Depending on the design, an intermediate washer can be shaft or housing 
centred (ig. 3 and ig. 4) 
Intermediate washers must have the same 
hardness and surface inish as bearing 
washers  SKF does not supply intermediate 
washers, but provides material speciications 
and dimensional data on request

Needle roller thrust 
bearings with a

AXW series needle roller thrust bearings 
with a centring lange (ig. 2 and ig. 5):
• are available for 10 ≤ d ≤ 50 mm
• accommodate axial loads in one direction 
only
• consist of a needle roller and cage thrust 
assembly and a thrust washer with a  
centring lange
The lange facilitates mounting and 
accurately centres the housing washer 
radially (ig. 6 and ig. 7) 
Combined needle roller 
bearing arrangements 
To accommodate combined radial and axial 
loads, needle roller thrust bearings in the 
AXW series can be combined with the  
following radial needle roller bearings:
• drawn cup needle roller bearings with a 
closed end or with open ends (ig. 6)
• needle roller bearings with machined 
rings (ig. 7)
These arrangements provide a cost- 
effective and compact solution for combined

Bearing washers
Bearing washers are required in applications 
where adjacent machine components cannot 
serve as raceways 
Appropriate washers are listed in the 
product tables, page 906 and must be 
ordered separately, because of the number 
of possible combinations 
The following series can be combined with 
needle roller thrust bearings:
LS series universal washers 
(ig. 8)
• are made of hardened carbon chromium 
bearing steel
• can be used as shaft or housing washers 
for needle roller thrust bearings in the AXK 
series
• can be used as shaft washers for bearings 
in the AXW series
• are available for 6 ≤ d ≤ 160 mm
• raceway surface is ground, while all other 
surfaces are turned
• are used for applications where accurate 
centring of the washers is not necessary 
or where low speeds are involved
• washer face opposite the side with the 
chamfers is the raceway surface and 
should face the rollers
AS series thin universal washers 
(ig. 9)
• are 1 mm thick
• are made of spring steel and hardened
• can be used as shaft or housing washers 
for needle roller thrust bearings in the AXK 
series
• can be used as shaft washers for bearings 
in the AXW series
• are available for 4 ≤ d ≤ 160 mm
• can be used to provide a cost-effective 
bearing solution, if adjacent machine 
components are not hardened, but have 
adequate stiffness and the requirements 
to geometrical tolerances are moderate
Both faces of the washers are polished and 
can be used as raceways 
811 series shaft (preix WS) and 
housing washers (preix GS)
• are used primarily with cylindrical roller 
and cage thrust assemblies
• can also be combined with needle roller 
and cage thrust assemblies
• can be used in high-speed applications 
where accurate centring of the bearing 
washers is required
For additional information about 811 series 
washers, refer to Cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings, page 877  
SKF needle roller thrust bearings are itted 
with one of the cages shown in table 1

least 120 °C (250 °F). 
Steel cages can be used at the same operating temperatures as the bearing washers 
and rollers. For temperature limits of polymer cages, refer to Polymer cages, 
page 188.
For temperature limits of SKF greases, refer 
to Selecting a suitable SKF grease, page 116. 
(page 117).

1) The envelope requirement (symbol  from ISO 14405-1) is not shown but applies to all tolerance classes.
Raceways on shafts 
and in housings
• should have the same hardness, surface 
inish and axial run-out as a bearing 
washer, if the load carrying capacity of a 
needle roller and cage thrust assembly is 
to be fully exploited
• should be designed using the dimensions 
Ea and Eb (product tables, page 906), 
which take radial displacement of the 
roller set into consideration
For additional information, refer to Raceways 
on shafts and in housings, page 179.
Abutment 
Abutment dimensions should fulil the 
following:
• Support surfaces on shafts and in housings should be at right angles to the shaft 
or housing axis and should provide  
uninterrupted support over the entire 
washer face.
• The abutment diameter on the shaft 
should be ≤ Ea and in the housing ≥ Eb. 
Values for Ea and Eb (product tables, 
page 906) take the movement and position of the roller set into consideration.
• Shafts and housings should be manufactured to suitable tolerance classes 
(table 4) to provide satisfactory radial 
guidance for the individual thrust bearing 
components:
 – Housing centred washers † radial space 
between the shaft and washer bore 
required
 – Shaft centred washers † radial space 
between the washer and the housing 
bore required
Needle roller and cage thrust assemblies in 
the AXW series are generally combined with 
drawn cup needle roller bearings (ig. 6, 
page 897) or needle roller bearings with 
machined rings (ig. 7, page 897). The same 
housing tolerance must be selected for the 
centring lange as for the radial bearing.
Needle roller and cage thrust assemblies 
are generally shaft centred, to reduce the 
circumferential speed at which the cage 
slides against the guiding surface. This is 
particularly important for higher-speed 
applications. The guiding surface should be 
ground.

13 Spherical roller thrust bearings


SKF spherical roller thrust bearings have 
specially designed raceways and asymmetrical rollers  The bearings can accommodate 
axial loads acting in one direction and simultaneously acting radial loads  The load is 
transmitted between the raceways via the 
rollers at an angle to the bearing axis, while 
the lange guides the rollers (ig. 1).
• High load carrying capacity
The large number of rollers, which have 
an optimum conformity with the washer 
raceways, enables the bearings to accommodate heavy axial and simultaneously 
acting radial loads.
• Accommodate misalignment
SKF spherical roller thrust bearings are 
self-aligning and can accommodate 
 misalignment (ig. 2).
• Separable design
SKF spherical roller thrust bearings are 
separable, making it possible to mount 
and dismount the housing washer separately from the shaft washer and roller and 
cage assembly. In addition this facilitates 
maintenance inspections.
• High speed capability
The cage designs and the optimum conformity of the rollers with the washer 
raceways make the bearings suitable for 
relatively high speeds.
The special roller proile reduces edge 
stresses at the roller/raceway contact 
• Low friction
The optimized roller end / lange contact 
keeps frictional heat at low level, even at 
high speeds.

13 Spherical roller thrust bearings


Basic design 
Depending on their series and size, SKF 
spherical roller thrust bearings are manufactured to two basic designs (ig. 3)  Their 
cage forms a non-separable unit with the 
shaft washer and rollers 
Bearings with no designation 
sufix (e.g. 29272)
• are itted with a machined brass prongtype cage as standard
E design bearings (designation 
sufix E)
• have larger rollers and an optimized internal 
design for increased load carrying capacity
• are itted with one of the following cages, 
depending on bearing size:
 – size ≤ 68 → stamped steel window­type 
 – size ≥ 72 → machined metal prong­type 
SKF Explorer 
For information, refer to page 7 
Cages in SKF spherical roller thrust bearings 
are an integral part of the bearing internal 
design  All SKF spherical roller thrust bearings 
contain a strong metal cage  This enables 
them to tolerate high temperatures and 
operate with all lubricants 
For additional information about the suit­
ability of cages, refer to Cages, page 187 
• No designation sufix
• E design (size ≥ 72)
E design (size ≤ 68)


13 Spherical roller thrust bearings
Boundary dimensions: ISO 104
Total height H:
• for basic design bearings, tolerance at least 50% tighter than ISO standard
• for SKF Explorer bearings, tolerance 75% tighter than ISO standard
Values: ISO 199 (table 10, page 46)
The permissible misalignment is reduced as the load increases.
Guideline values for rotating shaft applications: table 1.
Whether these values can be fully exploited depends on the design of the bearing arrangement, the external 
sealing design, etc.
For applications with a rotating housing washer, or where the direction of misalignment is not constant relative 
to the housing washer, additional sliding may occur in the bearing and misalignment should be < 0,1°.

Abutment 
The abutment dimensions da min and Da max 
listed in the product table, page 922, apply 
for axial bearing loads Fa ≤ 0,1 C0.
For heavier bearing loads, it may be necessary to support the shaft and housing 
washers over their entire side faces (da = d1 
and Da = D1).
For heavy loads, where P > 0,1 C0, the 
shaft washer bore must be fully supported 
by the shaft, preferably by an interference it  
Even the housing washer should be radially 
supported (ig. 4) 
For additional information about dimensioning washer supports, contact the SKF 
application engineering service 
Recessed housing 
bore for bearings 
with a stamped steel 
For bearings itted with a stamped steel 
 window-type cage, the housing bore must 
be recessed (ig. 5) to prevent the cage from 
contacting the housing during possible misalignment  SKF recommends the following 
guideline values for the recess diameter:
• D + 15 mm for bearings with an outside 
diameter D ≤ 380 mm
• D + 20 mm for bearings with an outside 
diameter D > 380 mm
Axial clearance in 
arrangements
SKF spherical roller thrust bearings in face­
to­face or back­to­back arrangements should 
be preloaded  However, at the relatively low 
speeds shown within the green area in 
diagram 1, the application can be designed 
to operate with a small axial clearance  For 
these applications, bearings with a modiied 
shaft washer (designation sufix VU029) 
should be used  Small axial clearance enables 
simple and cost­effective bearing arrange­
ments to be used, e g  for horizontal shaft 
applications at relatively low speeds, as no 
external preload is necessary 
For additional information about bearing 
arrangements with axial clearance, contact 
the SKF application engineering service

The washers of SKF spherical roller thrust

Generally, SKF spherical roller thrust bearings 
can be lubricated with oil or grease containing EP additives 
Where lubricating with grease, the roller 
end / lange contacts must be supplied with 
an adequate amount of grease. Make sure to 
use a grease with high oil bleeding, such as 
SKF LGWM 1, LGWM 2 or LGEP 2 (Selecting 
a suitable SKF grease, page 116).
Pumping effect in oil 
lubricated 
The internal design of spherical roller thrust 
bearings creates a pumping action, which 
produces a low from the small to the large 
roller end face, that can be taken advantage 
of in oil lubricated applications. This pumping 
action occurs in applications where the shaft 
is vertical or horizontal (ig. 6) and should be 
considered when selecting the type of lubricant and sealing arrangement.
For bearings with a machined cage used 
in high-speed applications, SKF recommends 
the oil injection lubrication method (ig. 7).
For additional information about lubricating 
spherical roller thrust bearings, contact the 
SKF application engineering service.

13 Spherical roller thrust bearings
SKF spherical roller thrust bearings are 
 separable, making it possible to mount and 
dismount the housing washer separately 
from the shaft washer and roller and cage 
Where a spherical roller thrust bearing 
with a machined metal cage is to be replaced 
by an E design bearing with a stamped steel 
window-type cage, and axial forces are 
transmitted via the cage guiding sleeve, a 
spacer ring must be inserted between the 
shaft abutment and the shaft washer (ig. 8) 
The spacer ring must be hardened and its 
side faces should be ground  Appropriate 
spacer ring dimensions for SKF spherical 
roller thrust bearings are listed in the 
product table, page 922

14 Cam rollers


SKF cam rollers (yoke-type track rollers 
based on ball bearings) are designed to run 
on all types of tracks and to be used in cam 
drives, conveyor systems, etc 
The outer ring running surface is crowned 
as standard  Double row cam rollers are also 
available with a cylindrical (lat) outer ring 
running surface 
SKF supplies cam rollers greased, sealed 
and ready-to-mount  They are available in 
two main designs and also as variants of 
these:
• single row cam rollers based on deep 
groove ball bearings in the 62 series 
(ig. 1)
• double row cam rollers based on double 
row angular contact ball bearings in the 32 
dimension series (ig. 2)
Cam roller features
• Accommodate high radial loads
The thick-walled outer ring enables high 
radial loads, while reducing distortion and 
bending stresses 
• Accommodate tilting moments
Double row cam rollers accommodate 
higher tilting moments than single row 
cam rollers 
The crowned outer ring running surface is 
beneicial for applications where outer ring 
tilting relative to the track may occur or 
where edge stresses need to be 
minimized.
• Relatively high speed capability

14 14 Cam rollers


Single row cam 
rollers
• are based on deep groove ball bearings in 
the 62 series (ig. 1)
• have a thick-walled outer ring with its 
running surface crowned
• are capped with a sheet steel reinforced 
NBR contact seal on both sides
• are greased for the life of the bearing and 
cannot be relubricated (table 1)
When capped bearings must operate under 
certain conditions, such as very high speeds 
or high temperatures, some grease may 
leak. For bearing arrangements where this 
would be detrimental, appropriate actions 
should be taken.
Double row cam 
rollers
• are based on double row angular contact 
ball bearings in the 32 dimension series 
(ig. 2)
• have a thick-walled outer ring with its 
running surface available in two designs:
 – crowned as standard (series designation 
3058‥ C)
 – cylindrical (lat) (series designation 
3057‥ C)
• have a 30° contact angle, enabling, 
together with the two ball sets, tilting 
moments to be accommodated
• are supplied capped in two variants:
 – with a sheet steel shield on both sides 
that extends into a recess on the inner 
ring (designation sufix -2Z)
 – with an NBR contact seal on both sides 
(designation sufix -2RS1) 
These cam rollers are not listed in this 
catalogue, but can be found online at 
skf com/go/17000-14-2 
• are greased for the life of the bearing 
under normal operating conditions 
(table 1)
• should be relubricated, if:
 – subjected to moisture or solid 
contaminants
 – they run for long periods at temperatures above 70 °C (160 °F)
• have a lubrication hole in the inner ring
 – Where suitable ducts are provided in the 
pin, the bearings are easy to relubricate 
 – The grease should be applied slowly to 
avoid damaging the shields or seals 
When capped bearings must operate under 
certain conditions, such as very high speeds 
or high temperatures, grease may appear 
between the inner ring and capping device  
For bearing arrangements where this would 
be detrimental, appropriate actions should 
be taken

Dynamic loads
As track rollers are not supported in a housing, the outer rings 
deform, leading to an altered load distribution and bending stresses in 
the outer ring 
The basic load ratings listed in the product tables, page 938, take 
into account the altered load distribution, while the maximum radial 
loads Fr max (product tables) are based on the bending stresses 
Static loads
Permissible static load is the lower value of F0r max or C0 
(product tables).
Axial loads
Cam rollers are intended for predominantly radial loads. However, 
axial loads can occur because of skew or tilting or when the outer ring 
runs against langes for brief periods.
Axial loads acting continuously on the outer ring may reduce the 
cam roller service life. To evaluate these inluences, contact the SKF 
application engineering service.

Typically, temperature peaks are at the 
seal lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in SKF 
cam rollers are provided in table 1, 
page 933  For temperature limits of other 
SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable 
SKF grease, page 116 
(page 117).
Speed limits
The limiting speed listed in the product tables 
is a mechanical limit that should not be 
exceeded unless the bearing design and the 
application are adapted for higher speeds. 
For additional information, refer to Operating temperature and speed, page 130.
Pins
Pins or shafts should be machined to tolerance class g6:
• for normal operating conditions, such as 
stationary inner ring load
• where easy displacement of the inner ring 
is required
Support surfaces
Continuously axial loaded cam rollers should 
be supported over the entire inner ring side 
face (ig. 3) and the support surface should 
be dimensioned according to diameter d1

SKF support rollers are available without or 
with lange rings (ig. 2). They have a thickwalled outer ring with its running surface 
crowned as standard. However, support 
 rollers with a cylindrical (lat) running surface 
are also available (designation sufix X) 
Support rollers without lange rings 
require adjacent components to guide the 
outer ring and cage axially.
Support rollers with lange rings do not 
need adjacent components to guide the 
outer ring and cage axially (ig. 3). Axial 
loads, which are induced when shafts are 
not horizontal or aligned properly, are 
accommodated by the lange rings.

page 187 
SKF support rollers are supplied greased 
(table 1, page 933) 
(R)STO design support rollers can be oil or 
grease lubricated  In applications where oil is 
used, SKF recommends thoroughly washing 
the initial grease ill from the bearing prior to 
operation 
For general information, refer to Lubrication, page 109 
Relubrication 
requirements
Support rollers:
• should be relubricated regularly to achieve 
their full service life, even if the initial 
grease ill still has its full lubricating 
properties
• used in applications where there are light 
loads, relatively low speeds and clean 
 surroundings can operate for long periods 
before relubrication is required
• that operate under contaminated and 
damp conditions at high speeds or at tem­
peratures > 70 °C (160 °F) require more 
frequent relubrication
• without a cage (full complement of rollers) 
require more frequent relubrication
Relubrication 
features
The inner rings of SKF support rollers have 
one lubrication hole, except:
• NNTR designs with d ≤ 90 mm † three 
lubrication holes
• NNTR designs with d ≥ 100 mm † six 
lubrication holes
If suitable ducts are provided in the pin, the 
bearings are easy to relubricate

Dynamic loads
As track rollers are not supported in a housing, the outer rings 
deform, leading to an altered load distribution and bending stresses 
in the outer ring 
The basic load ratings listed in the product tables, page 954 , 
take into account the altered load distribution, while the maximum 
radial loads Fr max (product tables) are based on the bending 
stresses 
Static loads
Permissible static load is the lower value of F0r max or C0 
(product tables).
Where requirements for smooth running are below normal, the 
static load may exceed C0, but should never exceed the maximum 
permissible static radial load F0r max.
Axial loads
Support rollers are intended for radial loads. However, support rollers 
with lange rings can generally accommodate axial loads that can 
occur because of skew or tilting. The magnitude of permissible load 
depends on the internal design.

15 Support rollers
support rollers can be limited by:
rings and rollers
Bearing rings and rollers
SKF support rollers are heat stabilized up to 
at least 140 °C (280 °F).
Steel cages can be used at the same operating temperatures as the bearing rings and 
rollers. For temperature limits of PA66 
cages, refer to Polymer cages, page 188 
seals depends on the seal material:
• NBR: –40 to +100 °C (–40 to +210 °F)
Temperatures up to 120 °C (250 °F) can 
be tolerated for brief periods 
• PA66 sliding rings: –30 to +100 °C (–20 to 
+210 °F)
Typically, temperature peaks are at the seal 
lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in SKF 
support rollers are provided in table 1, 
page 947  For temperature limits of other 
SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable 
SKF grease, page 116

Speed limits
The limiting speed listed in the product 
tables is a mechanical limit that should not 
be exceeded unless the bearing design and 
the application are adapted for higher 
speeds  
For additional information, refer to Operating temperature and speed, page 130 
Pins
For general information, refer to Bearing 
interfaces, page 139 
For support rollers with an inner ring, the 
pin/shaft should be machined to tolerance 
class g6 under the following conditions:
• stationary inner ring load
• where easy displacement of the inner ring 
is required


To exploit the full load carrying capacity of 
support rollers without an inner ring, the 
pin/shaft should:
• be machined to tolerance class k5
• be machined to a surface inish similar to a 
bearing raceway
• have the same hardness as a bearing 
raceway
For additional information about raceways 
on shafts, refer to Raceways on shafts and in 
housings, page 179 
Support surfaces
For support rollers without lange rings, the 
outer ring support surfaces:
• guide the outer ring and cage during 
operation
• must be ine turned
• must be free of burrs and clean
• should extend to at least half the outer 
ring side face (ig. 11), if unhardened – 
hardened surfaces may be smaller
Heavily loaded support rollers with lange 
rings should be axially supported:
• over the entire lange ring side faces 
(ig. 12)
• according to diameter d1 (product table, 
page 956)
Support roller with lange rings – support 
surface design
min. 0,2 mm
Support roller without an inner ring – 
axial gap
Support roller without lange rings – 
 guiding surface design
Axial gap
The following support rollers must be 
located without any axial gap:
• support rollers without lange rings, with 
an inner ring (ig. 11)
• support rollers with lange rings (ig. 12)
Support rollers without an inner ring must 
have an axial gap ≥ 0,2 mm between the 
outer ring and the support surfaces (ig. 13) 
SKF recommends positioning the lubrication 
hole in the unloaded zone of the inner ring  
Positioning is not needed for PWTR and 
NNTR design support rollers, which have the 
lubrication holes in the empty space 
between the two roller sets 
Where mounting the outer ring assembly 
and inner ring separately, care must be 
taken not to damage the seal lips

16 Cam followers


SKF cam followers (stud-type track rollers) 
are designed to run on all types of tracks and 
to be used in cam drives, conveyor systems, 
etc  
SKF cam followers are based on either 
needle or cylindrical roller bearings  Instead 
of an inner ring, they have a threaded solid 
stud (pin) 
SKF supplies them ready-to-mount  To 
meet the requirements of different applications, they are available in several designs 
and variants (ig. 1):
• with or without a cage
• with different stud designs:
 – a concentric seat
 – an eccentric collar
• with several sealing solutions
• with the outer ring running surface proile:
 – crowned as standard
 – cylindrical (lat)
In contrast to ball and roller bearings, where 
the bearing size refers to the bore diameter 
d, for cam followers the size refers to their 
outside diameter D.

Cam follower features
• Accommodate high radial loads
The thick-walled outer ring enables high 
radial loads, while reducing distortion and 
bending stresses 
• Accommodate axial loads
The lange rings enable cam followers to 
accommodate axial loads that can occur 
because of skew or tilting.
The crowned outer ring running surface is 
beneicial for applications where outer ring 
tilting relative to the track may occur or 
where edge stresses need to be 
minimized 
• Easy to mount
The threaded solid stud (pin) of cam followers can be quickly and easily attached 
to appropriate machine components by 
means of a hexagonal nut 
SKF cam followers have a thick-walled outer 
ring with its running surface crowned as 
standard  However, cam followers with a 
cylindrical (lat) running surface are also 
available (designation sufix X) 
SKF cam followers are available in three 
basic designs (ig. 2):
• KR design
• NUKR design
• PWKR design

SKF cam followers are supplied greased 
(table 1, page 933) 
For general information, refer to Lubrication, page 109 
Relubrication requirements
Cam followers:
• should be relubricated regularly to achieve 
their full service life, even if the initial 
grease ill still has its full lubricating 
properties
• used in applications where there are light 
loads, relatively low speeds and clean 
 surroundings can operate for long periods 
before relubrication is required
• that operate under contaminated and 
damp conditions at high speeds or at temperatures > 70 °C (160 °F) require more 
frequent relubrication
• without a cage (full complement of rollers) 
require more frequent relubrication
KR design cam followers of sizes 16 and 19 
with designation sufix PPSKA cannot be 
relubricated 
Cam follower relubrication points
Relubrication features
Cam followers can be relubricated via ducts 
inside the stud  Depending on series and 
size, there are up to three positions for relubrication (ig. 12):
• Positions 1 and 2 can be itted with the 
grease itting supplied with the cam 
follower 
• Position 3 should be used when relubricating via ducts in the adjacent 
components 
• For detailed information about the positions, refer to product tables, page 978 
• For cam followers, sizes ≥ 35, positions 1
and 2 can be connected to a centralized
lubrication system (Accessories,
page 968) 
• Positions not used for relubrication should 
be closed by a grease itting or a plug 
(Accessories)

Dynamic loads
As track rollers are not supported in a housing, the outer rings 
deform, leading to an altered load distribution and bending stresses 
in the outer ring 
The basic load ratings listed in the product table, page 978, take 
into account the altered load distribution, while the maximum radial 
loads Fr max (product table) are based on the bending stresses 
Static loads
Permissible static load is the lower value of F0r max or C0 
(product table) 
Where requirements for smooth running are below normal, the 
static load may exceed C0, but should never exceed the maximum 
permissible static radial load F0r max 
Axial loads
Cam followers are intended for radial loads  However, their lange 
rings enable cam followers to accommodate axial loads that can 
occur because of skew or tilting  The magnitude of permissible load 
depends on the internal design

16 Cam followers
cam followers can be limited by:
rings and rollers
Bearing rings and rollers
SKF cam followers are heat stabilized up to 
at least 140 °C (280 °F) 
Steel cages can be used at the same operating temperatures as the bearing rings and 
rollers 
seals depends on the seal material:
• NBR: –40 to +100 °C (–40 to +210 °F)
Temperatures up to 120 °C (250 °F) can 
be tolerated for brief periods 
• PA66 sliding rings: –30 to +100 °C (–20 to 
+210 °F)
Typically, temperature peaks are at the seal 
lip 
Temperature limits for greases used in SKF 
cam rollers are provided in table 1, 
page 933  For temperature limits of other 
SKF greases, refer to Selecting a suitable
SKF grease, page 116 
Speed limits
The limiting speed listed in the product 
table is a mechanical limit that should not be 
exceeded unless the bearing design and the 
application are adapted for higher speeds  
For additional information, refer to Operating temperature and speed, page 130 
Attachment holes for 
studs
The holes in the adjacent part of machinery 
that will accommodate the stud or eccentric 
collar of a cam follower should be machined 
to tolerance class H7 
If the requisite tightening torque for the 
hexagonal nut (table 3, page 970) cannot be 
achieved or the cam followers are subjected 
to peak loads, the stud or eccentric collar 
should be mounted with an interference it  
The lead-in chamfer of the holes should be 
≤ 0,5 × 45° 
Support surfaces
The lange ring that is pressed onto the stud 
shank should be axially supported:
• over its entire side face (ig. 13)
• according to diameter d1 (product table, 
page 978)
• with material that has a suficiently high 
strength to accommodate the tightening 
torque (table 3, page 970)
Supported lange ring
974


Cam followers can be attached to associated 
components (ig. 13) using the hexagonal 
nut (table 3, page 970) supplied with the 
cam follower  Spring washers, which are not 
supplied by SKF, serve to secure the nuts 
• To exploit the full load carrying capacity of 
cam followers, the nuts should be tightened to the recommended torque values 
(table 3) 
• Where heavy vibrations occur, cam followers can be located using:
 – self-locking nuts in accordance with 
ISO 10511
 – special lock washers
For self-locking nuts, a higher tightening torque must be applied  Follow the 
recommendations of the nut 
manufacturer 
• Cam followers, sizes ≥ 22, have a hexagonal recess in the stud head and can be 
held in place by a hexagonal key (Allen 
wrench) while the nut is being tightened 
• Some small cam follower designs (sizes 16 
and 19) have a slot in the stud head 
instead and can be held in place by a 
screwdriver  For additional information, 
refer to the illustrations in the product 
table, page 978 
• Depending on the mounting conditions, 
cam followers with an eccentric collar can 
be adjusted to the required eccentricity via 
the slot or the hexagonal recess 
• Do not hit the head of the stud as damage 
to the cam follower may result 
• SKF recommends positioning the lubrication hole in the stud head in the unloaded 
zone of the cam follower  The position of 
this hole corresponds to the SKF trademark on the head end of the stud 
• The lubrication hole in position 3 that is 
parallel and in line with the lubrication 
hole in the stud head (ig. 12, page 971) 
may be used to incorporate a locking 
device to prevent the stud from turning 
• When inserting a plug, it should be 
pressed into place using a mandrel 
(ig. 14)

SKF motor encoder units
SKF sensor bearing units are used to monitor accurately the status of rotating or linear 
components and are:
• compact
• robust and reliable
• simple and ready-to-mount
Sensor-integrated solutions engineered by 
SKF have been well proven in a variety of 
industrial and automotive applications, such 
as electric motors, electric vehicles, road 
rollers, tractors, forklifts and conveyors  
 Typical uses include:
• motor management
• steering
• speed and position sensing
• measurement of angular position
Motor encoder 
units 
Monitoring the status of rotating components 
accurately is essential for many applications  
This is particularly true for AC motors that 
require encoders to measure the speed and 
the direction of rotation continuously 
SKF motor encoder units (ig. 1) combine 
active sensor technology with an SKF 
Explorer deep groove ball bearing and are:
• able to provide a signal resolution ranging 
from 32 to 80 digital pulses per revolution
• compact only 6,2 mm wider than the corresponding standard deep groove ball 
bearing (ig. 2)
• ready-to-mount and can be mounted at 
either bearing position in an AC motor
• available for shaft diameters ranging from 
15 to 45 mm

Motor encoder units
SKF motor encoder units are compact, integrated units consisting of (ig. 3):
• an SKF Explorer deep groove ball bearing 
in the 62 series with a snap ring groove in 
the outer ring and an RS1 contact seal 
(Single row deep groove ball bearings, 
page 241) 
• an impulse ring
• a sensor body
• a connecting cable
The impulse ring, which attaches to the 
inner ring of the bearing, is a composite 
magnetized ring that contains between 32 
and 80 north and south poles  The number 
of poles depends on the size of the bearing  
The sensor body, which is attached to the 
outer ring, protects the patented SKF Hall 
effect cell  The multi-wire connecting cable 
extends in the radial direction 
The bearing is protected by a contact seal 
on one side  On the opposite side of the 
bearing, the impulse ring and sensor body 
create an effective labyrinth seal to keep 
lubricant in and solid contaminants out of 
the bearing 
Sensor technology
SKF motor encoder units use a compact and 
robust sensor that produces an incremental 
encoder signal  The sensor is accurate down 
to zero revolutions per minute  An integrated 
active circuit (requiring an external voltage 
supply) in the sensor body contains two Hall 
effect cells that produce an output signal 
consisting of two square waves (ig. 4)  
The signals can be interpreted by motor 
controllers in different ways:
• The direction of rotation can be determined from the phase shift, when the 
 rising edge of a signal irst appears 
• Low speeds can be determined by measuring the time between two electrical 
events, such events being the rising and 
falling edge on either square wave 
• High speeds can be measured by counting 
the number of electrical events within a 
given time period 
The two square waves are 90° out of phase 
with each other  This phase shift changes 
sign with the direction of rotation  ig. 4 
shows the general speciications of the signal  The presence of two signals in quadrature enables a processing unit to multiply the 
number of angular position increments per 
revolution  For example, using a standard 
SKF sensor bearing with 64 pulses per revolution and a standard electronic interface 
that can detect the rising (Low/High) and 
falling (High/Low) times of each of the two

signals, it is possible to obtain 256 electrical 
events per revolution, which translates to an 
angular resolution of 1,4° (ig. 4, page 989).
SKF motor encoder units provide accurate 
and reliable signals for effective motor control and are 100% tested for period accuracy, 
duty cycle and phase shift during 
manufacture 
Cable connection
SKF motor encoder units are available as 
standard with one of the following:
• a free cable end with an output signal consisting of two square waves, designation 
sufix 008A (ig. 5)
• an AMP Superseal™ connector (AMP Nos  
282106-1 and 282404-1), designation 
sufix 108A (ig. 6)
Standard cable lengths are listed in the 
product table, page 1002  For alternative 
connectors or cable lengths, contact SKF 
SKF motor encoder units are:
• illed, under clean conditions, with a 
high-quality grease (table 2, page 245) 
that is suitable for the most common 
operating conditions of electric motors
• virtually maintenance-free
The grease life in the bearing can be calculated according to the method described 
under Grease life for capped bearings, 
page 246 
Motor encoder units for 
extreme operating 
Magnetic sensors have temperature and 
motor power limits  For applications where 
magnetic sensors are not practical, 
high-performance inductive technology can 
be used instead  Inductive sensors use coils 
to sense the rotation of a specially designed 
induction tooth ring  For additional information about motor encoder units for extreme 
operating conditions, contact SKF

Requirements for the 
receiving interface
The receiving interface must be able to process the signals, which are provided via open 
collector circuits (ig. 7)  Output signal features are listed in table 1  The phase shift is 
the delay between the two signals’ rise 
events (ig. 4, page 989)  It is 1/4 of the 
period, or 90 electric degrees  The duty cycle 
value is the high state of the signal compared 
to the full period (ig. 4)  It is nominally 50%  
Power supply
SKF motor encoder units require a regulated 
voltage supply, which can range from 5 to 
18 V DC  For applications above 18 volts, 
contact SKF  
Resistors
Pull-up resistors (table 2) should be placed 
between the voltage supply and the conductors for the output signals to limit the output 
current to 20 mA  The application load 
resistance between the ground line and the 
conductors for the output signals should be 
at least 10 times higher than the resistance 
of the pull-up resistor  This helps to keep the 
output signals readable  
Detecting direction of rotation
A positive phase shift corresponds to signal 
B rising before signal A and indicates the 
inner ring rotating clockwise when viewed 
from the sensor side

In principle, SKF motor encoder units can be 
incorporated in designs in the same way as 
SKF deep groove ball bearings  Some speciic recommendations are described below. 
For additional information about electric 
motor applications, refer to the SKF handbook Rolling bearings in electric motors and 
generators.
Cable outlet
The cable emerges radially from the motor 
encoder unit. A suficiently dimensioned 
cable duct must be provided in the bearing 
housing or housing cover. The radial notch in 
the housing should have a width in the circumferential direction of 15 to 20 mm 
(ig. 8) 
Motor encoder units in the 
non-locating bearing 
position
SKF recommends using motor encoder units 
in the non-locating bearing position (ig. 9)  
However, there is a risk that the outer ring 
can spin in the housing bore, especially if 
vibration is a factor  Therefore, SKF recommends placing an O-ring in the snap ring 
groove to help prevent the outer ring from 
spinning, which could otherwise damage the 
cable 
Motor encoder units in the 
locating bearing position
When using motor encoder units in the 
locating bearing position, the impulse ring, 
sensor body and connecting cable should 
not be subjected to any axial load, whenever 
possible  When the bearing is subjected to 
axial loads that act in both directions, the 
motor encoder unit should be mounted in 
such a way that the heavier axial load is 
transmitted to the bearing outer ring side 
face opposite the sensor (ig. 10) 
Motor encoder units can be located axially 
in the housing in different ways:
• with a snap ring in the outer ring and a 
cover bolted to the housing (ig. 11)
• with a spacer sleeve and a snap ring in the 
housing (ig. 12)
• with a cover engaging the outer ring 
(ig. 13)
Motor encoder units with d ≤ 25 mm can 
only be located axially via a snap ring in the 
Motor encoder units in 
loating bearing 
arrangements
When using motor encoder units in loating 
bearing arrangements (page 76), the outer 
ring should be prevented from spinning by 
placing an O-ring in the snap ring groove  
The motor encoder unit should be mounted 
in such a way that the axial load acts on the 
bearing outer ring side face opposite the 
sensor

17 Sensor bearing units
SKF motor encoder units must be handled 
with care to avoid damaging the bearing, 
sensor and connecting cable  Never apply 
any force on the cable, cable outlet, sensor 
body or impulse ring 
On request, SKF can provide assistance in 
optimizing the mounting and connecting 
processes  
Mounting a unit on a shaft
Motor encoder units are typically mounted 
on a shaft with an interference it. They can 
be pressed onto the shaft by applying a 
mounting force via a mounting sleeve or 
dolly abutting the inner ring side face 
(ig. 14). To facilitate mounting, the bearing 
inner ring can be heated:
• Use a temperature-controlled electric 
hotplate.
• Do not heat the unit above 80 °C (175 °F) 
• Place the bearing on a mandrel to heat the 
inner ring effectively (ig. 15) 
• Position the bearing so that the seal is in 
the lower position to avoid grease leaking 
out of the bearing 
• Do not use induction heaters as damage 
to the electronic components may result

Motor encoder units
Mounting a unit into a 
housing
When motor encoder units have to be 
mounted into a housing with an interference 
it, they can be pressed into the housing or 
the housing should be heated. The mounting 
force should be applied via a mounting 
sleeve or dolly abutting the outer ring side 
face or via a snap ring itted on the outer ring 
(ig. 16).
In typical electric motor applications, the 
bearing can be moved into position by using 
bolts to pull the motor shield and cover 
together (ig. 17).
Cable connection
The cable should be protected by a duct to 
prevent it from making sharp turns, being 
pinched or making contact with any moving 
parts. To avoid any interference with the 
sensor signal, do not place the connector 
near other power cables or wires.
Refer to Designation system, page 258.

Roller encoder 
units
SKF roller encoder units (ig. 18, table 3) are 
plug-and-play sensor bearing units 
designed for applications with outer ring 
rotation 
The encoder units:
• incorporate a sealed 6201 SKF Explorer 
deep groove ball bearing, which is lubricated for the life of the bearing
• can be easily integrated into pulleys, cams, 
rollers, or wheels to provide a compact 
outer ring rotation encoder assembly
• can be supplied, on request, complete with 
customized gears, wheels or pulleys
Sensor technology
SKF roller encoder units use similar sensors 
as SKF motor encoder units (page 988)  
They provide two signals, which can be used 
to determine relative position, speed, acceleration and direction of movement  The 
requirements for the receiving interface are 
the same as for SKF motor encoder units

SKF steering encoder units use sensors to 
track the movement of a steering wheel  
They contain two sets to provide redundancy  The sensors:
• are magnetic
• are non-contact and incremental
• do not wear
• are protected from external inluences
• are designed to provide maximum service 
life
SKF steering encoder units comply with the 
safety requirements of safety-related control 
systems in accordance with ISO 13849 
SKF steering encoder units provide two 
independent sets of square wave signals 
(ig. 20) via open collector circuits  They 
require:
• a regulated voltage supply, which can 
range from 5 to 24 V DC
• pull-up resistors (table 2, page 991) that 
should be placed between the voltage 
supply and the conductors for the output 
signals to limit the output current to 
20 mA
The application load resistance between the 
ground line and the conductors for the output signals should be at least 10 times 
higher than the resistance of the pull-up 
resistor  This keeps the output signals 
readable 
Units providing absolute 
position information
SKF can provide customized steering units 
for applications where a combination of 
absolute position information, variable 
steering feel, and active end stops are 
required  For additional information, contact 
SKF 
Rotor positioning 
sensor bearing 
units
Synchronous motors require a sensor that 
provides the position of the rotor with a high 
accuracy, to enable accurate motor torque 
control and to achieve maximum eficiency 
and dynamics  These motors use either 
direct drive or sine wave control  SKF rotor 
positioning sensor bearing units (ig. 21, 
table 5) can contribute to optimized motor 
eficiency for both systems 
Rotor positioning sensor bearing unit
Units for sine wave or vector 
control
• provide the shaft angle position in real 
time throughout the entire motor speed 
range
• provide a signal (diagram 1) comparable 
to the one provided by a resolver and can 
therefore be used by the motor controller’s 
software
• communicate the shaft angle position via a 
sine/cosine wave signal
• are more compact and cost-effective than 
inductive resolvers
• are easy to mount (Mounting, page 994)
• do not require special shaft or housing 
accuracy in comparison with inductive 
resolvers (Design considerations,

Rotor positioning 
SKF Rotor positioning bearings (ig. 22, 
table 6) are customized units with optimized 
mechanical integration between a magnetic 
impulse ring and a bearing in an application  
The integrated units:
• allow the use of nearly all bearing types
• allow high speeds and temperatures
• generate strong magnetic impulses that 
are related to the rotor angular position
• can deliver the magnetic ield in the axial 
or radial direction, on a through shaft or at 
the end of a shaft
• are very robust under severe operating 
conditions as a result of their high magnetic ield strength
Applications
• absolute angular position information for 
electric motor control in, for example:
 – belt-driven starter generators
 – traction motors
 – e-superchargers and e-turbochargers
• shaft speed detection or low-resolution 
angular position in, for example:
 – crankshafts
 – transmission shafts

18 High temperature bearings


SKF high temperature bearings are designed 
to deliver increased reliability, reduced complexity and decreased environmental impact 
in operating temperatures up to 350 °C 
(660 °F)  Because SKF high temperature 
bearings correspond to the ISO dimensions 
of grease-lubricated bearings, production 
eficiencies and cost savings can be realized 
with a simple change to the SKF bearing 
solution 
The environmental beneits of SKF high 
temperature bearings are so signiicant in 
many applications that they are included in 
the “SKF Beyond Zero” product portfolio  
Bearing beneits and features
• Reduced total operating cost
The bearings are designed to maintain the 
radial clearance needed for high temperature operation and so will not seize, even 
when they cool rapidly, and therefore 
 provide a long service life 
• Excellent performance under severe
conditions:
 – hot conditions
 – dry environments
 – low rotational speeds
• Reduced environmental impact
• Reduced machine design complexity
Additionally, the beneits and features of 
high temperature bearings include (ig. 1):
1 No need for relubrication
All variants, except open (without shields) 
VA201 deep groove ball bearings, are 
lubricated for the life of the bearing with 
graphite-based high temperature lubricants  Open VA201 bearings require relubrication (Relubrication and running in, 
page 1014) 
individual bearings † skf com/mount
Bearing beneits and features
1006
18 High temperature bearings


2 Simple replacement
The boundary dimensions are the same as 
those of standard bearings 
3 Operating temperature up to 350 °C 
(660 °F)
The internal radial clearance and the 
lubricant are optimized for operation at 
high temperatures 
4 Protection against solid contamination
 – Shields (designation sufix 2Z) protect 
the deep groove ball bearing.
 – Shields and lingers (designation sufix 
2F) protect the insert bearing.
5 Improved running in
The entire bearing surface is manganese 
phosphate coated.
Lubrication solutions
SKF high temperature bearing designs and 
variants incorporate various graphite-based 
lubrication solutions, including:
• lubricating paste composed of a polyalkylene glycol/graphite mixture
• graphite cages (segmented or coronet)
For an overview of lubricant types, and other 
characteristics, for high temperature deep 
groove ball bearings and insert bearings, 
refer to table 1, page 1009, and table 2, 
page 1010.
During operation, the graphite maintains 
a very thin ilm on the bearing’s raceways 
and rolling elements to reduce wear signiicantly. Graphite ages at a much higher temperature than oil and grease, and therefore 
does not lose its lubricating properties at the 
high temperatures at which it is recommended for use, so the need for relubrication 
is eliminated.
With many variants, all surfaces of the 
bearing and, where applicable, shields and 
lingers are manganese phosphate coated to 
enhance adhesion of the lubricant to the 
metal and provide some protection against 
corrosion.
Typical applications
• metals industry (cooling beds, roller 
tables, furnaces)
• food and beverage industry (continuous 
baking ovens, wafer baking ovens)
• automotive industry (paint lines, heat 
treatment ovens)
• glass industry (glass tableware or lat glass 
manufacturing processes)
• construction industry (tiles, mineral wool 
manufacturing)
Assortment
The SKF standard assortment of high temperature bearings and bearing units corresponding to ISO standards includes:
• Deep groove ball bearings (ig. 2)
• Insert bearings (Y-bearings, ig. 3)
• Ball bearing units (ig. 4,
skf.com/go/17000-18)
 – Zinc chromate plummer block units
 – Zinc chromate square langed units
 – Zinc chromate oval langed units
The assortment includes variants that contain food-grade lubricants registered by NSF 
as category H1 (lubricant acceptable with 
incidental food contact, for use in and around 
food processing areas). The NSF registration 
conirms the lubricant fulils the requirements 
listed in the US Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines under 21 CFR section 
178.3570.

18 High temperature bearings
Deep groove ball 
bearings for high 
SKF deep groove ball bearings for high temperature applications correspond in design 
to standard single row deep groove ball 
bearings of the same size  They have no illing 
slots and can accommodate axial loads in 
addition to radial loads (Loads and selecting 
bearing size, page 1012) 
The entire surface of the bearing and 
shields are manganese phosphate coated to 
enhance adhesion of the lubricant to the metal 
and improve the running-in properties of 
the bearing 
The radial internal clearance is a multiple 
of C5 to prevent the bearings from seizing, 
even when they cool rapidly.
The SKF assortment of deep groove ball 
bearings for high temperature applications 
(ig. 6) provides solutions for various combinations of operating temperature and speed.
The lubrication type, maximum operating 
temperature, limiting speed, maintenance 
requirements and all other primary characteristics of the variants within the assortment 
are listed in table 1.
Sealing solutions
High temperature deep groove ball bearings 
can be protected from contamination by 
either integrated shields, external shields or 
a combination of both.
For high temperature bearings, metallic 
shields are the primary recommendation 
where a capping device with low complexity 
is required. The shields:
• prevent the ingress of solid contaminants 
into the bearing
• are non-contacting
• generate no friction
• do not wear
• are particularly well suited for high temperatures because of their material and 
design
Customized deep groove ball bearings
Integrated shields
High temperature deep groove ball bearings 
with designation sufix 2Z have integrated 
shields, but the VA201 variant is also available 
as an open bearing (ig. 6) 
External shields
In some cases, integrated shields are insuficient and additional external shields should 
be considered, such as:
• Nilos rings (ig. 7)
• SKF sealing washers (ig. 8)
For additional information about sealing 
solutions, refer to External sealing, 
page 194, and Seals (skf com/seals) 
NOTE: Because of the large radial clearance 
for high temperature deep groove ball bearings, special attention should be given to the 
design of the sealing arrangement 
Custom-made seals
In cases where neither integrated nor external 
shields are applicable, SKF can provide 
 custom-made seals for operating temperatures up to 250 °C (480 °F)  These seals are 
usually made of PTFE (polytetraluoroethylene) thermoplastics 
To further improve sealing systems that 
incorporate custom-made seals, it is preferable to use a wear sleeve such as the 
SKF Speedi-Sleeve (skf com/seals)  This 
improves the seal counterface condition 
without the need for re-machining  For

Insert bearings 
for high 
Except for the cage and seals, SKF insert 
bearings (Y-bearings) for high temperature 
applications correspond in design to standard insert bearings with grub screws in the 
YAR 2-2F series (page 342)  
The grub (set) screws in the inner ring 
enable quick and easy mounting/dismounting  The bearings have a shield and a linger 
on both sides to prevent the ingress of solid 
contaminants into the bearing 
The entire surface of the bearing and the 
shields are manganese phosphated to 
enhance adhesion of the lubricant to the 
metal and improve the running-in properties of the bearing  The lingers are treated 
by pickling 
The radial internal clearance is a multiple 
of C5 to prevent the bearings from seizing, 
even when they cool rapidly.
The SKF assortment of insert bearings for 
high temperature applications (ig. 9) provides solutions for various combinations of 
operating temperature and speed.
The lubrication type, maximum operating 
temperature, limiting speed, maintenance 
requirements and all other primary characteristics of the variants within the assortment are listed in table 2.

Misalignment increases bearing noise and reduces bearing service life, and when it exceeds the guideline values, these effects 
become particularly noticeable 
Stabilization
120 °C (250 °F)
150 °C (300 °F)
The rings, rolling elements and cages of SKF high temperature 
bearings undergo the same heat stabilization process as the relevant standard bearing  As a result, for higher operating temperatures, a certain amount of dimensional change is to be expected  
Greater clearances accommodate temperature differentials and 
material structural changes 
Sealing solutions
SKF high temperature insert bearings are 
capped on both sides with a shield and a 
linger that create a narrow gap-type labyrinth seal (designation sufix 2F) 
For high temperature bearings, metallic 
shields are the primary recommendation 
where a capping device with low complexity 
is required  The shields:
• prevent the ingress of solid contaminants 
into the bearing
• are non-contacting
• generate no friction
• do not wear
• are particularly well suited for high temperatures because of their material and 
design

Loads and 
selecting bearing 
size
The bearing size is selected based on the 
basic static load rating C0 from the relevant 
product table.
For an equivalent static bearing load P0, 
the selected bearing must have a C0 value ≥ 
the value of the requisite basic static load 
rating C0req (table 5).
The values in table 5 are valid only when 
P0 = Fr. That is, when:
• Fa < 0,8 Fr
• Fa < 0,15 C0

environment
SKF high temperature bearings are designed 
to provide solutions to common issues in 
high temperature applications  In addition to 
operations involving high temperatures and 
low rotational speeds, it is important to consider environmental conditions in the process 
area 
Since high temperature bearings are supplied without preservative oils and must be 
used without grease or oil lubrication, the 
anti-corrosion property of the bearings is 
limited  Therefore, the bearings should be 
used in a dry environment or with a proper 
sealing solution to keep the bearings dry

To accommodate axial displacement, the 
shaft at the non-locating bearing position of 
high temperature insert bearings should be 
provided with one or two grooves, 120° 
apart, to engage a modiied grub screw:
• Hexagon socket grub (set) screws with a 
dog point, in accordance with ISO 4028, 
but with a ine thread according to 
table 10, page 357  The grub screw 
should be secured by a nut and a spring or 
star lock washer (ig. 10) 
The screws and groove(s) accommodate 
changes in shaft length and prevent the 
shaft from turning independently of the 
bearing  The sliding surfaces between the 
shaft and inner ring and those in the shaft 
grooves should be coated with a lubricant 
paste suitable for the operating 
1013


18 High temperature bearings
Relubrication and 
running in
Relubrication
All SKF high temperature bearings are lubricated for the life of the bearing, except open 
VA201 deep groove ball bearings, which 
require relubrication 
The general recommendation for an open 
VA201 bearing is to investigate the quality of 
the lubricating paste in the bearing every six 
months  If there is no longer a ilm of dry 
lubricant on the raceways, indicated by a 
bright metallic shiny track, remove residues 
of the old lubricant with a solvent and, when 
dried, replenish the bearing with lubricating 
paste 
Running in
VA201 bearings operating at temperatures 
below 200 °C (390 °F) and at speeds below 
25% of the limiting speed (product tables, 
page 1016 and page 1020) require running 
in  Open VA201 deep groove ball bearings 
operating under these conditions also 
require running in after relubrication 
Running in requires the bearing to be 
operated at a temperature of at least 200 °C 
(390 °F) for a minimum of 48 hours 
SKF high temperature deep groove ball 
bearings should always be hot mounted to 
reduce the mounting force and the risk of 
breaking the graphite lubricant (VA208 and 
VA228 variants)  An induction heater is the 
preferred choice to heat the bearing during 
mounting 
Submerging the bearing in hot oil is not 
recommended because the oil remaining in 
the bearing might carbonize later during 
operation 
Do not use impact mounting methods 
that could damage the bearing and prevent 
proper functionality

19 Bearings with Solid Oil


SKF bearings with Solid Oil are designed for 
use in applications where high levels of 
moisture and incidental contact with water 
and other contaminants are real issues  
Bearings with Solid Oil are lubricated for the 
life of the bearing and cannot be 
relubricated 
Solid Oil: 
• is an oil saturated, polymer material
 – moulded into the bearing, forming very 
narrow gaps between the rolling elements, raceways and cage(s), enabling the 
bearing to rotate freely
 – having a porous structure, with millions 
of micro-pores that retain the lubricating 
oil by surface tension
• virtually ills all of the free space in the 
• releases oil into the narrow gaps, during 
operation, providing effective minimum 
quantity lubrication
 – An increase in operating temperature 
pushes the oil toward the surface of the 
polymer material, supporting consistent 
lubricant supply  During shutdown, any 
excess oil is re-absorbed back into the 
polymer material 
• Extended lubricant life
 – With Solid Oil bearings, a large amount 
of oil is available (two to four times more 
compared to conventional grease ill) 
 – The Solid Oil polymer structure elimin- 
ates lubricant churning 
 – Solid Oil is a high-quality synthetic oil 
that resists oxidation 
• Resists washout
 – Solid Oil cannot be washed out and virtually ills all free space, limiting the 
amount of wet contamination that can 
enter the bearing 
 – Water cannot mix with the oil or Solid Oil 
polymer 
• Virtually eliminates lubricant leakage
 – Solid Oil retains oil in the bearing 
 – Integral bearing seals further increase 
the oil retention 
• Protects against the ingress of
contaminants
 – Close osculation between Solid Oil and 
the rolling elements and raceways signiicantly reduces the ingress of 
contaminants 
 – Solid Oil provides additional support for 
integral bearing seals

Bearings and bearing units with Solid Oil
The SKF standard assortment of bearings 
and bearing units with Solid Oil (ig. 1) 
includes:
• Deep groove ball bearings
• Spherical roller bearings
• Insert bearings and ball bearing units
• Tapered roller bearings
• Cylindrical roller bearings
• Self-aligning ball bearings
On request, SKF can supply other bearing 
types with Solid Oil to meet the needs of a 
particular application, except for CARB toroidal roller bearings which are unsuitable for 
use with Solid Oil  Bearings itted with a 
large-volume c age are not suitable for Solid 
Oil because there is too little free space 
inside the bearing.
Solid Oil variants 
• Standard variant (designation sufix W64, 
table 1):
 – contains a high-quality synthetic oil
 – meets the needs of most applications
• Food-grade variant (designation sufix 
W64F, table 1):
 – contains an oil registered by NSF as  
category H1
 – meets the needs of food applications
• with integral contact seals are strongly 
recommended in wet environments
• with Solid Oil increase the sealing effect- 
iveness, as the Solid Oil supports the seals 
axially, preventing them from delecting 
and opening under pressure
For information about sealing options, contact the SKF application engineering service.
Where carbon steel bearings are exposed 
to wet environments, additional external 
seals are recommended to protect the bearing’s external surfaces from corrosion.

19 Solid Oil bearings
Load carrying 
The basic dynamic and static load ratings for 
bearings with Solid Oil are the same as for 
corresponding SKF standard bearings 
bearings with Solid Oil can be limited by:
rings and rolling elements
• the cage(s)
• the Solid Oil
For limits of bearing rings, rolling elements, 
cage(s) and seals, refer to Temperature limits 
of the relevant product section of the standard bearing 
The relevant limits for Solid Oil are listed 
in table 1, page 1025 
Where temperatures outside the permissible range are expected, contact SKF 
Speed limits
The recommended speed values for bearings and bearing units with Solid Oil 
(table 2), operating in an ambient temperature of 20 °C (70 °F), are limited by the maximum continuous operating temperature of 
85 °C (185 °F). Ambient temperature is the 
temperature closest to the bearing position, 
not necessarily room temperature.
For bearing types or variants not listed in 
table 2, contact the SKF application engin- 
eering service.
For ambient temperatures above 20 °C

INSOCOAT bearings p1030
Electric motors, generators and associated 
equipment are at risk when an electric current passes through their bearings  This can 
damage the contact surfaces of rolling elements and raceways in the bearings (electrical 
erosion) and rapidly degrade the grease  An 
additional risk in electric motors and generators comes from high frequency currents 
caused by the inherent stray capacitance  
The risk of damage increases where the 
application uses a frequency converter 
INSOCOAT bearings:
• are designed to prevent electric current 
from passing through the bearing
• have the external surfaces of either their 
inner or outer ring coated with an insulating aluminium oxide layer, by applying a 
sophisticated plasma-spray process for an 
outstanding quality inish
• are a very cost-effective solution compared with other insulation methods
• Protection against electrical erosion
With insulating properties integrated into 
the bearing, INSOCOAT bearings can 
improve reliability and increase machine 
uptime by virtually eliminating the problem of electrical erosion 
• High electrical resistance
The aluminium oxide coating provides a 
minimum electrical resistance of 200 MΩ
and can withstand voltages up to 
3 000 V DC 
• Consistent electrical performance
Plasma-spray coatings are normally 
hygroscopic and, therefore, vulnerable to 
penetration caused by condensation  To 
protect against this effect, INSOCOAT 
bearings are treated with a unique 
sealant

During mounting, INSOCOAT bearings 
should be handled in the same way as 
standard bearings 
When using an induction heater for bearings with a coated inner ring (designation 
sufix VL2071 or VL2076), use a protective 
sleeve or an additional plastic support block 
In cases where springs are used to apply

21 Hybrid bearings


Hybrid bearings have rings made of bearing 
steel and rolling elements made of bearing 
grade silicon nitride (Si3N4), which make the 
bearings electrically insulating.
Silicon nitride rolling elements can extend 
bearing service life by offering enhanced 
bearing performance, even under dificult 
operating conditions  When compared to 
same-sized bearings with steel rolling elem- 
ents, the beneits of hybrid bearings include:
• Protection from electric current
damage
Hybrid bearings are non-conductive and 
therefore suitable for applications such as 
AC and DC motors and generators, where 
electric currents are present 
• Higher speed capability
The density of a silicon nitride rolling elem- 
ent is 60% lower than a same-sized rolling 
element made of bearing steel  Lower 
weight and inertia translates into higher 
speed capability and superior behaviour 
during rapid starts and stops 
The lower frictional heat generated in 
hybrid bearings, especially at high speeds, 
contributes to extended bearing service 
life and extended relubrication intervals 
• High wear-resistance
Silicon nitride rolling elements have a 
higher degree of hardness making hybrid 
bearings suitable under dificult conditions 
and contaminated environments 
• High bearing stiffness
With a high modulus of elasticity, hybrid 
bearings offer increased bearing stiffness 
• Reduced risk of smearing
Even under inadequate lubrication conditions, such as high speeds and rapid accelerations, or where there is an insuficient 
hydrodynamic ilm, the risk of smearing is 
reduced between silicon nitride and steel 
surfaces  For conditions where κ < 1, it is 
common to apply κ = 1 for hybrid bearing 
life calculations (Lubrication condition – 
the viscosity ratio, κ, page 102) 
• Reduced risk of false brinelling
When subjected to vibration, hybrid bearings are signiicantly less susceptible to 
false brinelling (formation of shallow 
depressions in the raceways) between the 
silicon nitride and steel surfaces 
• Less sensitivity to temperature
gradients
Silicon nitride rolling elements have a 
lower coeficient of thermal expansion, 
which means they are more stable over 
temperature gradients within the bearing 
and provide more accurate preload/clearance control

Hybrid deep groove 
Deep groove ball bearings are the most 
widely used bearing type, especially in electric motors  SKF hybrid deep groove ball 
bearings (ig. 2):
• are non-separable
• are suitable for high speeds
• accommodate radial loads and axial loads 
in both directions because their uninterrupted raceway grooves have a close 
osculation with the balls
• are manufactured to SKF Explorer bearing 
quality (page 7)
• are available with a bore diameter ranging 
from 5 to 180 mm
• with a bore diameter d ≤ 45 mm, are most 
suitable for electric motors in the power 
range 0,15 to 15 kW as well as for power 
tools and high-speed drives
SKF hybrid deep groove ball bearings in 
this size range are the most cost-effective 
solution against electrical erosion 
• are available with a bore diameter 
d ≥ 10 mm
• use the same seals as described under 
Capped bearings, page 242
• are lubricated for the life of the bearing 
and should not be washed or relubricated
• are virtually maintenance-free
When capped bearings must operate under 
certain conditions, such as very high speeds 
or high temperatures, grease may appear 
between the inner ring and capping device  
For bearing arrangements where this would 
be detrimental, appropriate actions should 
be taken

to the housing occurs within these bearings. As a 
result, there is virtually no increase in friction.
Electrical 
properties
• Protection against AC and DC currents
• High impedance, even for very high frequencies, providing good protection against high frequency current and 
voltage peaks
• Voltage level before the irst arcing occurs through the seal–bearing contact of small hybrid deep groove ball 
bearings (NBR contact seal): > 2,5 kV DC

21 Hybrid bearings
Bearing rings
The rings of SKF hybrid bearings are heat 
stabilized up to at least:
• 120 °C (250 °F) for basic design hybrid 
deep groove ball bearings
• 150 °C (300 °F) for hybrid cylindrical roller 
bearings and XL hybrid deep groove ball 
On request, SKF can supply hybrid bearings 
with rings stabilized for operating temperatures up to 300 °C (570 °F) 
Steel, brass or PEEK cages can be used at 
the same operating temperatures as the 
bearing rings of standard hybrid bearings  
For temperature limits of other polymer 
cages, refer to Polymer cages, page 188 
seals depends on the seal material:
• NBR: –40 to +100 °C (–40 to +210 °F)
Temperatures up to 120 °C (250 °F) can 
be tolerated for brief periods 
• FKM: –30 to +200 °C (–20 to +390 °F)
Temperatures up to 230 °C (445 °F) can 
be tolerated for brief periods 
Typically, temperature peaks are at the seal 
lip 
Temperature limits for the grease used in 
sealed SKF hybrid deep groove ball bearings 
are provided in table 3, page 116  For temperature limits of other SKF greases, refer to 
Selecting a suitable SKF grease, page 116 
The speed ratings in the product tables 
(Hybrid deep groove ball bearings, 
page 1050 and Hybrid cylindrical roller

22 NoWear coated bearings


NoWear is a wear-resistant carbon coating 
that can be applied to the rolling elements 
and inner ring raceway(s) of a bearing 
(designation sufix L7DA) or only the rolling 
elements (designation sufix L5DA) (ig. 1) 
A physical vapour deposition process 
applies the wear-resistant carbon coating  
Thickness of the coating ranges  from 1 to 
3 μm, depending on the size of the bearing  
The hardness of the coating is 1 200 HV10 
NoWear coated bearing surfaces retain 
the toughness of the underlying material 
while adopting the hardness, improved friction properties and wear-resistance of the 
coating 
During the running-in period, minute 
amounts of the coating material are transferred to the counter-surfaces  This coating 
reduces friction and improves resistance 
against wear and smearing, even in bearings 
where only the rolling elements are coated 
• Withstand severe operating conditions
 – increased risk of smearing
 – insuficient lubricating ilm
 – sudden load variations
 – light loads
 – rapid speed changes
 – vibration and oscillations
Applications
NoWear coated bearings may provide new 
possibilities for existing applications operating 
under severe conditions  They can provide 
new design possibilities while requiring no 
major design changes  Typical applications 
where NoWear coated bearings are used 
include:
• paper machines
• marine and offshore applications
• fans
• compressors
• hydraulic pumps
• gearboxes
• hydraulic motors
NoWear coated bearings are not intended 
for vacuum or other completely dry running 
applications  The coating does not act as a 
barrier against oxygen and is therefore not 
recommended as a corrosion inhibitor

The most commonly used NoWear coated 
bearings have a coating on only the rolling 
elements (designation sufix L5DA). They are 
recommended for applications where the 
bearing load is light to normal, or where 
vibration and oscillating movements occur.
NoWear coated bearings that have the 
inner ring raceway(s) and rolling elements 
coated (designation sufix L7DA) are recommended for any of the following operating 
conditions:
• abrasive contaminants that can cause 
premature wear
• heavy loads
• unusual lubrication conditions such as 
bearings lubricated by the process media
Most SKF rolling bearings can be supplied as 
NoWear coated bearings  For variants not 
listed in table 1, contact SKF

of the standard bearing

Refer to Bearing data in the relevant product 
section of the standard bearing 
Bearing service 
life
The extended bearing service life that NoWear 
can provide in high-speed, lightly loaded 
applications is dificult to calculate and 
depends on a variety of factors. However, 
experience has shown a multifold improvement in bearing service life.
For greased bearings that operate at speeds 
near or above the permissible speed, or at 
high temperatures that shorten the grease 
life, using NoWear potentially extends re- 
lubrication intervals.
When operating under marginal lubrication conditions, NoWear can extend bearing 
service life.
Owing to the material combination of 
NoWear /steel in the contact area, the risk of 
smearing damage is reduced. NoWear coated 
bearings are recommended for applications 
with light loads in combination with high 
speeds, where smearing damage is an issue.
Load carrying 
capacity, equivalent 
bearing loads
Refer to Loads in the relevant product section 
of the standard bearing.
For temperature limits of the bearing, refer 
to Temperature limits in the relevant product 
section of the standard bearing.
The NoWear coating withstands temperatures up to 350 °C (660 °F) 
Refer to Permissible speed in the relevant 
product section of the standard bearing 
In general, the same lubrication guidelines 
are valid for NoWear coated bearings as for 
standard bearings (Lubrication, page 110)  
However, NoWear coated bearings can operate reliably even where adequate surface 
separation cannot be achieved  NoWear acts 
as a protective layer and may reduce the 
need for EP and AW additives in the 
lubricant 
system
Refer to Designation system in the relevant 
product section of the standard bearing 
The designation sufixes used to identify 
NoWear coated bearings are:

Adapter sleeves are the most commonly 
used components for locating bearings with 
a tapered bore onto a cylindrical seat as they 
can be used on (ig. 1):
• plain shafts
• stepped shafts
They are easy to install and require no additional location on the shaft:
• When used on plain shafts, the bearing 
can be located at any position on the shaft 
• When used on stepped shafts together 
with an L-shaped spacer ring, the bearing 
can be accurately positioned axially, 
thereby facilitating bearing mounting and 
SKF maintenance

Withdrawal 
sleeves


Withdrawal sleeves
Withdrawal sleeves are slit tapered sleeves 
(ig. 1), which can be used to mount bearings 
with a tapered bore onto a cylindrical seat of 
stepped shafts (ig. 2)  The sleeves are 
pressed into the bore of the bearing inner 
ring, which abuts a shaft shoulder or similar 
ixed component  They are located on the 
shaft by a nut or an end plate 
The standard assortment of SKF withdrawal sleeves is available online at 
skf com/go/17000-24-1 and comprises:
• basic design sleeves (ig. 1)
• sleeves for oil injection (ig. 3)
• sleeves for shaft diameters up to 
1 000 mm
Withdrawal sleeves are not listed in this catalogue. Comprehensive information about 
SKF withdrawal sleeves is available online at 
skf.com/go/17000-24.

25 Lock nuts


Lock nuts are used to locate bearings onto a 
shaft  Additionally, they can be used to 
mount bearings with a tapered bore onto 
tapered shaft seats and adapter sleeves, and 
to dismount bearings from withdrawal 
sleeves  Lock nuts are also frequently used 
to secure gears, belt pulleys and other 
machine components  
Lock nuts have to be secured to prevent 
unintentional loosening by: 
• a locking device that engages a keyway in 
the shaft or key slot in the adapter sleeve, 
or
• a locking mechanism integrated in the nut
When choosing or replacing a lock nut, there 
are a number of factors that should be taken 
into consideration  They include, but are not 
limited to:
• Space – axial and radial
• Shaft rotation – one or both directions
• Axial loads
• Dynamic behaviour of the application
• Cost and downtime of machining keyways 
in shafts vs  other locking methods
• Ease and frequency of assembly and 
disassembly
• Precision
SKF lock nuts provide a variety of ways to 
secure the nut onto a shaft  The lock nuts 
listed here constitute the basic SKF assortment  Lock nuts with other locking methods 
can be supplied on request  For additional 
information, contact SKF 
The following tables provide an overview 
over the basic SKF assortment:
• table 1 for SKF industrial lock nuts
• table 2, page 1092 for SKF precision lock 
nuts
Lock nuts with integral locking reduce the 
cost of the shaft as no keyway is required  
Installation is quicker and easier because no 
separate locking device is necessary  However, the loosening torque of these lock nuts 
requires more attention  For information on 
loosening torque, refer to Product data,

The locking principle
Lock nuts with integral locking are locked by 
friction  The friction is suficient to lock the 
nut in place  
KMFE lock nuts have an integral grub (set) 
screw, to lock the nut in place  When the 
grub screw is tightened, it causes the nut 
thread to deform and press against the shaft 
or sleeve thread (ig. 14) 
KMK have a threaded steel insert in their 
bore  The threads on the insert match the 
lock nut threads  The insert acts as a pressure plate when a grub screw, which runs 
through the body of the lock nut, is tightened 
(ig. 15)

The locking principle
KMT and KMTA series precision lock nuts 
have three locking pins equally spaced 
around their circumference (ig. 19 to 
ig. 21) that can be tightened with grub 
screws to lock the nut onto the shaft  The 
end face of each pin is machined to match 
the shaft thread  The holes for the locking 
pins and grub screws are drilled with their 
axis parallel to the loaded lanks of the shaft 
thread (ig. 22)  The locking screws, when 
tightened to the recommended torque, provide suficient friction between the ends of 
the pins and the unloaded thread lanks to 
prevent the nut from loosening under normal operating conditions (Loosening torque, 
page 1098)  Because the locking pins are 
tightened against the unloaded lanks of the 
shaft thread, they are not subjected to any 
application loads imposed on the nut

KMD lock nuts (ig. 23) were designed specifically for screw compressors but can be used 
in other applications where high precision, 
simple assembly and reliable locking are 
required  Once the four locking screws are 
tightened, the lock nut will be accurately 
positioned at right angles to the shaft thread  
The locking screws, when tightened to the 
recommended tightening torque, preload 
the lock nut and shaft threads and generate 
suficient friction to prevent the nut from 
loosening under normal operating conditions  The locking screws do not carry any 
part of the supported load in service 
KMD lock nuts are available for thread 
M 20x1 to M 105x2 (sizes 4 to 21) 
Features and beneits
• Maximum axial run-out between the 
locating face and thread: 0,005 mm
• Adjustable for precise axial positioning
• Effective locking prevents the nut from 
loosening under normal operating 
• Simple installation and removal
• No keyway required
• Reusable
• Designed for frequent installation and 
removal

skf com/go/17000-25-6 
The locking principle
KMD lock nuts are locked with axial locking 
screws (ig. 24)  The front of the lock nut 
locates the component on the shaft  The rear 
is tightened against the unloaded lanks of 
the shaft thread by axial locking screws, 
 creating suficient friction to prevent the lock 
nut from loosening under normal operating

locking pins engage the shaft thread 
4 Tighten the grub screws alternately with a 
torque wrench until the recommended 
torque value, listed in the product tables, is 
achieved 
Precision lock nuts with locking pins should 
not be used to drive a bearing up onto a 
tapered seat  
Adjustment
Precision lock nuts with locking pins are 
adjustable  The three equally-spaced locking 
pins enable these lock nuts to be accurately 
positioned at right angles to the shaft  However, they can also be adjusted to compensate for slight angular deviations of adjacent 
components 
Adjustments can be made using the following procedure (ig. 31 and ig. 32):
1 Loosen the grub screw(s) at the position 
showing the greatest deviation 
2 Tighten the remaining screw(s) equally 
3 Retighten the screw(s) that were loosened 
4 Check that the alignment of the nut, relative to the shaft, is currently as required 
5 Repeat the procedure if necessary 
Removal
When removing precision lock nuts with 
locking pins, the locking pins can still engage 
the shaft thread even after the grub screws 
have been loosened  Using a rubber hammer, tap the nut lightly in the vicinity of the 
pins to loosen them
