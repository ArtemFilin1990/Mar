Linear Motion Rolling Guides are used
with 	satisfactory 	results 	for 	various
applications requiring precision positioning
such 	as 	semi-conductor 	manufacturing
equipment and large-sized machine tools.
In contrast to conventional rolling bearings
used in rotating parts, Linear Motion Rolling
Guides are the products applicable to plane
sliding surfaces, and meet the increasing
needs 	for 	linear 	motion 	and 	precision
positioning in machines and equipment.
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way of rail
guide type, Linear Ball Spline of shaft guide
type, and other products, recognized for
their high quality and excellent features, are
available.
General
Description

-- 2 of 706 --

1 	High positioning accuracy
The low frictional resistance allows the use of smaller drive units, which makes it possible to design more
compact and lighter machines with less power consumption. So the machine cost and power cost can be
saved. In addition, machines can be operated at higher speeds, achieving higher machine efficiency.
2 	Reductions in machine size and power consumption
Owing to very little wear of raceways and rolling elements, high accuracy and reliability of machines and
equipment are maintained in long run operations. In addition, the thinner oil films needed to lubricate
Linear Motion Rolling Guides in comparison with conventional plain guides reduce errors caused by
variations in oil film thickness.
3 	Highly reliable accuracy in long run operations
Reliability of the machines and equipment is improved from the first stage of the design, because the life
of Linear Motion Rolling Guides can be estimated by using the established life calculation formulas
based on rolling contact fatigue.
4 	Improvement of product reliability from first design
In most cases, grease lubrication is sufficient, which requires only a simple design for lubrication and
simple maintenance.
5 	Simple design for lubrication
By giving a preload, the rigidity of Linear Motion Rolling Guides can be increased and a guide
mechanism free from play can be designed. 	A preloaded rolling guide also achieves smooth motion
even without any clearance.
6 	Guide mechanism free from play
Superior response characteristics to micro-feeding and accurate positioning performance can be
achieved owing to the stable frictional characteristics of rolling friction with small differences between
dynamic and static (start-up) friction and small variations in friction due to velocity changes.
Advantages of Linear Motion Rolling Guides
Advantages of Linear Motion Rolling Guides compared with conventional plain guides are
as follows.

1 A choice between ball types and roller types assures
the best selection for any application
Suitable designs in rail guide types and shaft guide types as well as limited motion types and endless
motion types are all parts of 	's standard product lines.
2 	A wide selection of various types for all kinds of industrial uses
Linear Motion Rolling Guides feature functional and simple designs. Compared to more complicated
designs needing extra steps in manufacturing, the simplicity of 	designs reduce the potential
processing errors that might occur during the various stages of production. Mounting errors can also be
eliminated.
3 	A functional simplicity in structure yields high reliability
Typical 	Linear Motion Rolling Guides are made into one complete unit of linear motion rolling guide
mechanism, and their sizes and accuracy are standardized. Design, assembly and maintenance time of
machines and equipment can be reduced greatly by adopting these products.
4 	Process reductions in designing and assembling
5 Superior performance and high quality through advanced
manufacturing techniques

and other precision machine components. 	This firm commitment to manufacturing excellence is
reflected in the superior performance and high quality of 	Linear Motion Rolling Guides.
offers two basic design concepts: steel ball types and cylindrical roller types. Steel ball types are
most suited for general purpose applications requiring a light to medium load capacity and low frictional
resistance. Cylindrical roller types, in comparison, are most often selected for machines needing a high
load capacity and very high rigidity.

When linear motion rolling guides are operated over a certain period, they will eventually wear out even
under normal operating conditions. 	This is because the raceways and rolling elements of linear motion
rolling guides are subjected to repeated loads and will become damaged by rolling contact fatigue of
material characterized by the formation of scale-like wear fragments (fatigue flaking). These damaged rolling
guides can no longer be used. The life of linear motion rolling guide is defined as the total traveling distance
accomplished before the first evidence of fatigue flaking appears on one of the raceways or rolling elements.
There is a variation in life because material fatigue is a statistical phenomenon. 	The basic rating life is
therefore calculated statistically.

Life of Linear Motion Rolling Guides
The basic dynamic load rating of linear motion rolling guide is the constant load both in direction and
magnitude that gives the basic rating life as shown in Table 1, when a group of identical rolling guides are
individually operated.
The basic dynamic load rating may be corrected for the direction of applied load. For details, see the
description of each series.
Basic dynamic load rating
C (Complying with ISO 14728-1) ( 1 )
The basic rating life of linear motion rolling guide is defined as the total traveling distance that 90% of a
group of identical rolling guides can be operated individually under the same conditions free from any
material damage caused by rolling fatigue.
However, the basic rating life of Stroke Rotary Bushing is represented by the total number of revolutions.

Temperature factor
Since the allowable contact stress of rolling guides will gradually decrease when the operating temperature
of the rolling guide rises over 150˚C, the basic dynamic load rating must be corrected for temperature.
Hardness factor
The raceway surface hardness must be 58 to 64HRC. When the hardness is lower than 58HRC, the basic
dynamic load rating must be corrected by the following formula.

Basic static load rating
C 0 (Complying with ISO 14728-2) ( 1 )
The basic static load rating of linear motion rolling guide is defined as the static load which gives the contact
stress as shown in Table 4 at the center of the contact area between the rolling element and the raceway
receiving the maximum load.
If a large load or a heavy shock is applied to a rolling guide when it is stationary or running at a relatively low
speed, a local permanent deformation may be made on the rolling elements and/or the raceway surfaces of
the slide unit, track rail, external cylinder, shaft, etc. When this permanent deformation becomes larger than
a certain size, it will prevent smooth rolling motion and cause the guide to generate noise or vibrate,
resulting in degradation in traveling performance and eventually early-stage damage.
The basic static load rating is used in combination with the static safety factor to give the load that may
cause the permanent deformation exceeding this limit.
The basic static load rating may be corrected for the applied load direction. For details, see the description
of each series.
Basic Static Load Rating and Static Safety Factor	Basic Static Load Rating and Static Safety Factor
Static moment rating
The static moment rating is defined as the static moment which gives the contact stress as shown in Table
4 at the center of the contact area between the rolling element and the raceway receiving the maximum load
when the moment shown in the examples of Fig. 3 is applied.
Generally, like the basic static load rating, the static moment rating is used in combination with the static
safety factor to give the limiting load for normal rolling motion.

Static safety factor
The basic static load rating and the static moment rating (or static torque rating ) are considered as the
theoretical allowable limit of load for normal rolling motion. In practice, this limit must be corrected by the
static safety factor considering the operating conditions and performance required of linear motion rolling
guides. 	The static safety factor is obtained by the formulas below, and Tables 5.1 to 5.4 give standard
values of this factor. For moment or torque load, the formula (1.4) is a representative formula. The static
safety factor is calculated in each direction by applying the static moment rating and the maximum moment
in that direction.

Load factor
Due to vibration and/or shocks during machine operation, the actual load on each rolling guide becomes
greater in many cases than the theoretically calculated load. 	The applied load is generally calculated by
multiplying the theoretically calculated load by the load factor indicated in Table 9.
In some series of Linear Motion Rolling Guides excluding Linear Way and Linear Roller Way, the dynamic
load rating and static load rating corrected for the direction of the theoretical applied load are used for
calculating the basic rating life and static safety factor. For details, see the description of each series.

Mean equivalent load for fluctuating load
When the load on the rolling guide fluctuates, the mean equivalent load Pm is used in place of the load P in
the life calculation formula.
The mean equivalent load is a constant load which gives the basic rating life equal to that for the fluctuating
load. It is obtained by the following formula.

Because the dynamic equivalent load changes stepwise along the traveling distance, the average load is
calculated from q in Table 11 on page 36.
The basic rating life of slide unit 1 receiving the largest dynamic equivalent load is calculated. The basic rating life is
obtained by the formula given in Table 2 on page 21 while considering the load factor fw.
As the result of the above calculation, the basic rating life is about 3030 hours.

Fig. 4 Effect of preload on elastic deformation due to load
Preload	Preload
A clearance may be given to linear motion rolling guides, when the load is small and very smooth motion is
required. However, in many cases, preload is preferred, because it eliminates play in the guide mechanism
and increases the rigidity of rolling guide.
Preload is given by applying an internal stress, in advance, to the contact area between raceways and
rolling elements. When a load is applied on the preloaded rolling guide, elastic deformation due to the load
is smaller compared to that without preload by the effect of this internal stress, and the rigidity of rolling
guide is increased. (See Fig. 4.)
Even when high rigidity must be obtained, excessive preload should be avoided, because it will produce an
excessive stress between rolling elements and raceways, and eventually result in short life of rolling guides.
It is important to apply a proper amount of preload, considering the operating conditions. 	When linear
motion rolling guides must be used with a large preload, consult 	for further information.
Linear Bushing and Stroke Rotary Bushing should never be given a large amount of preload.
Purpose of preload
The preload amount is determined by considering the characteristics of the machines and equipment on
which the rolling guide is mounted and the nature of load acting on the rolling guide. The standard amount
of preload for linear motion rolling guides is, in general, approx. 1/3 of load when the rolling elements are
balls (steel balls) and approx. 1/2 of load when they are rollers (cylindrical rollers). If the rolling guides are
required to have very high rigidity to withstand vibration or fluctuating load, a larger preload may be applied.

For sealed guides, seal resistance is added to the above value, but this resistance varies greatly with the
interference amount of seal lip and lubrication conditions.
Where the methods of lubrication and mounting are correct and the load is moderate, the friction
coefficients of linear motion rolling guide in operation are within the range shown in Table 12. 	Generally,
friction coefficient is large under small load. Fig. 5 gives typical examples of this relationship.

Note( 1 ) : These friction coefficients do not include the seal friction.
The static friction (start-up friction) of linear motion rolling guides is much lower than that of conventional
plain guides. 	Also, the difference between static friction and dynamic friction is small, and friction varies
little when velocity changes. These are excellent features of linear motion rolling guides, and account for
their ability to reduce power consumption, suppress operating temperature rise, and increase traveling
speed.
Since frictional resistance and variation are small, high speed response to motion commands and high
accuracy positioning can be achieved.
Friction of Linear Motion Rolling Guides
The frictional resistance of rolling guides varies with their type, load, traveling speed and lubricant used.
Generally speaking, lubricants or seals are major factors in determining the frictional resistance in light load
and high speed applications, while the magnitude of load is the major factor in heavy load and low speed
applications. The frictional resistance of rolling guides actually depends on various factors, but the following
formula is used for practical purposes.

Purpose of lubrication
The purpose of lubrication for linear motion rolling guides is to keep raceways, rolling elements, etc. from
direct metal-to-metal contact, and thereby reduce friction and wear and prevent heat generation and
seizure. 	When an adequate oil film is formed between the raceways and rolling elements at the rolling
contact area, the contact stress due to load can be moderated. Lubrication is important for ensuring the
reliability of linear motion rolling guides.
Selection of lubricant
To obtain the full performance of linear motion rolling guides, it is necessary to select an appropriate
lubricant and lubrication method by considering the type, load and speed of each linear motion rolling guide.
However, as compared with plain guides, lubrication of linear motion rolling guides is much simpler. Only a
small amount of lubricant is needed and the replenishment interval is longer, so maintenance can be greatly
reduced. Oil and grease are the two most commonly used lubricants for linear motion rolling guides.
Grease lubrication
For grease lubrication of linear motion rolling guides, lithium-soap base grease (Consistency No.2 of JIS) is
commonly used. 	For rolling guides operating under heavy load conditions, grease containing extreme
pressure additives is recommended.
In clean and high-vacuum environments, where low dust generation performance and low vaporization
characteristics are required, greases containing a synthetic base oil or a soap other than the lithium-soap
base are used. For applications in these environments, due consideration is necessary to select a grease
type that is suitable for the special operating conditions and achieves satisfactory lubrication performance at
the same time.
Grease Replenishment Interval
The quality of any grease will gradually deteriorate as operating time passes. 	Therefore, periodic
relubrication is necessary. The relubrication interval varies depending on the operating conditions of the
rolling guides. 	A six month interval is generally recommended and, if the machine operation consists of
reciprocating motions with many cycles and long strokes, relubrication every three months is
recommended.
Grease Replenishment Method
New grease must be supplied through a grease feed device such as a grease nipple until old grease is
discharged. After grease is replenished, running in is performed and excess grease will be discharged from
the inside of rolling guide. Discharged grease must then be removed before starting the operation.
The amount of grease required for standard replenishment is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the free space inside the
linear motion rolling guide. 	When grease is supplied from a grease nipple for the first time, there will be
grease lost in the replenishment path. The amount lost should be taken into consideration.
Generally, immediately after grease is replenished, frictional resistance tends to increase. 	If running-in is
performed for10 to 20 reciprocating cycles after excess grease is discharged, frictional resistance becomes
small and stable.
For applications where low frictional resistance is required, the replenishment amount of grease may be
reduced, but it must be kept to an appropriate level so as not to give a bad influence on the lubrication
performance.

Mixing different types of greases may result in changing the properties of base oil, soap base, or additives
used, and, in some cases, severely deteriorate the lubrication performance or cause a trouble due to
chemical changes of additives. Old grease should therefore be removed thoroughly before filling with new
grease.
For oil lubrication, heavy loads require a higher oil viscosity and higher operating speeds require a lower
viscosity. 	Generally, for linear motion rolling guides operating under heavy loads, lubrication oil with a
viscosity of about 68 mm2 /s is used. 	For linear motion rolling guides under light loads at high speeds,
lubrication oil with a viscosity of about 13 mm2 /s is used.

When linear motion rolling guides are operated at a temperature exceeding 150˚C, the basic dynamic load
rating must be corrected by using the temperature factor.
Some linear motion rolling guides comprise synthetic resin components. 	When they are used at high
temperature, these components may not endure the high temperature. 	The maximum operating
temperature for these linear motion rolling guides is 120˚C. For continuous operation, they can be operated
at temperatures not exceeding 100˚C. If the operating temperature exceeds 100˚C, consult 	for further
information.

Sealed types are available in some linear motion rolling guide series.
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way have end seals as a standard specification. In addition, double seals or
scrapers are provided as special specifications for improvement in dust protection performance. Caps for
covering the track rail mounting holes and a rail cover plate (Fig. 6) for covering the top surface of the track
rail will further increase the reliability for dust protection.
However, when a large amount of dust or foreign particles are floating in air, or when large foreign substances
such as chips or sand fall onto raceways, dust protection becomes difficult. In this case, it is recommended
to cover the entire guide mechanism with bellows (Fig. 7), telescopic shields, etc.
Method of dust protection
To obtain the full performance of linear motion rolling guides, it is important to protect them from the
intrusion of dust and other harmful foreign matter. Select an effective sealing or dust-protection device to
withstand any operating conditions that might be imposed.

Features of Linear Way and Linear Roller Way
1
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way are linear motion rolling guides which achieve
endless linear motion of a slide unit along a track rail by re-circulating rolling elements
inside the slide unit. Slide units and track rails are fixed on machines and equipment with
mounting bolts, and a highly accurate linear motion can readily be obtained.
As compared with other types of linear motion rolling guides, Linear Way and Linear Roller
Way have the following features.
2
Lower manufacturing cost
Large load capacity in any directions
It is not necessary to prepare a guide plane on machines and equipment by heat treatment and surface
finishing. A large reduction in man-hour and cost can be achieved in the design and manufacturing of
linear motion guide mechanism.
Loads in any directions can be received without making a complicated guide structure. A linear motion
rolling guide mechanism can readily be obtained that can withstand moment load and complex load.

Wide range of selections for high degree of design freedom
A wide range of variations in types and sizes makes it possible to select a model most suitable for the
operating conditions. Size variations range from track rail width 2 mm to 100 mm.
High rigidity for achieving compact design of machines and equipment
Because the track rail is firmly fixed on the mating mounting surface over its total length, high rigidity can
be obtained in comparison with shaft type guides which may be affected by shaft bending.

Features of Linear Way
Linear Way features the design in which large diameter steel balls are arranged in two
rows with each ball making four-point contact with the raceways, and has following
advantages over other types.
Large load capacity in any directions
The simple two-row raceway design makes it possible to incorporate large diameter steel balls for high
load ratings. Loads in any directions can almost uniformly be received.
Excellent strength against moment load and complex load
When
T0 moment is applied
A large moment load capacity can be obtained,
since the moment arm distance 	is long as
shown in the figure. Load capacity under complex
load is also large.

Measurement of raceway accuracy
Four-points contact structure
High accuracy with simple structure
Accurate and simple installation
The simple two-row raceway design minimizes the
number of potential errors in manufacturing and
measurement, and high dimensional accuracy of
raceways can be obtained.
Interchangeable specification products can be
manufactured benefiting from this feature by
rigorous control of the dimensional accuracy of
individual slide units and track rails.
4 Smooth operation and low noise
Smooth and quiet operation is achieved, because all raceway contours are precisely ground and the ball
re-circulating routes are designed based on the analysis of optimal functional characteristics.
Accurate parallel mounting of two track rails can
be made by aligning the attendant rail to the
datum rail. 	Because the rigidity in the lateral
direction is high, frictional resistance of poorly
aligned two rails will steeply increase giving a
warning so that misalignment can be easily
detected and corrected. Potential troubles due to
misalignment during actual operation such as
short life, degradation in guide accuracy can
therefore be eliminated in advance.
It is easy to butt-joint track rails to form longer
lengths.

Features of Linear Roller Way
Linear Roller Way features the design in which four rows of cylindrical rollers are
arranged in a highly rigid casing in a well balanced form. The rollers in each row are
arranged in parallel to each other and not crossed alternately. These linear motion rolling
guides achieve smooth motion with high rigidity, high accuracy and high reliability.
Very 	high 	rigidity 	is 	achieved 	owing 	to 	the
excellent elastic deformation characteristics of
cylindrical 	rollers 	which 	give 	smaller 	elastic
deformation under load as compared with steel
balls, and, in addition, to a large number of
cylindrical rollers incorporated in the slide unit.

series to achieve maintenance free operations for a long period of time.
This is the smallest of the Linear Ways.
Sizes with track rail width as small as 2mm and upward are made available owing to the
simple and compact design of 	Linear Way.
Series of Linear Way and Linear Roller Way
Reference page
Plastic separators are incorporated to eliminate direct contact between balls and thus achieve
smooth and quiet motion.
Lower, narrower and shorter. Compactness has been pursued in every dimension.
Incorporating large diameter steel balls as rolling elements, the product of this series has
large load ratings.
As a wide track rail is used, a large moment load as well as a complex load can be received.
This series is best suited to a single row rail arrangement, which provides a simple guide
structure.
By adopting a U-shaped track rail, rigidity against moment and torsion is greatly improved.
Cylindrical rollers are used as rolling elements, and arranged in four rows with the rollers in
each row being aligned in parallel to each other. Excellent load carrying performance is
obtained in all directions. The mounting dimensions of this series are interchangeable with
those of Linear Way H, so these two series can be exchanged readily.

Clean Environment
When Linear Way and Linear Roller Way are used
in clean environments such as a clean room, the
environment must not be polluted by the dust
generated from them, and also superior corrosion
resistance 	is 	required 	for 	them, 	since 	rust
preventive oil cannot be used.
Dust generation from Linear Way and Linear
Roller 	Way 	is 	mainly 	caused 	by 	lubricant
spattering, which can be avoided by using low
dust generation grease for clean environment.
As a corrosion prevention measure, Stainless
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way can be used or
black chrome surface treatment can be performed
to improve corrosion resistance.

Dust Protection
Spatter Protection
If foreign matter such as metal or wooden chips
fall onto the raceways of Linear Way and Linear
Roller Way, the life or accuracy of these guides
may be affected adversely. Therefore, measures
must be taken to prevent intrusion of foreign
matter.
Bellows 	covering 	the 	entire 	linear 	motion
mechanism is effective for dust protection. Also,
double end seals are often used to protect the
guides from intrusion of foreign matter. 	As dust
accumulated in mounting holes may intrude into
the 	slide 	unit 	and 	attach 	to 	the 	raceways,
mounting holes can be covered using caps or rail
cover plates.
Hot welding spatters adhering firmly on track rails
cannot be removed by ordinary dust protection
measures. 	Special measures for preventing
adhesion and removing adhered spatters are
necessary.
Welding spatters and similar foreign substances
can be removed easily by applying fluorine black
chrome surface treatment and providing a scraper
at the same time.

Lubrication and Dust Protection	Lubrication and Dust Protection
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way are most generally lubricated with grease, which allows for easy
lubrication control. A grease nipple for grease replenishment is provided on each slide unit of Linear Way and
Linear Roller Way of standard specification (except some models). 	Parts such as piping joints are also
available, and can be delivered if required.
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way are provided with special rubber seals for dust protection. But, if a
large amount of fine contaminants are present, or if large particles of foreign matter may fall on the track rail, it
is recommended to provide bellows and other protective covers.
The size 2, 3, 4, and 6 models of Linear Way L are not provided with seals.
A high quality lithium-soap base grease shown in Table 6 is pre-packed in 	Linear Way and Linear Roller
Way. A special grease can be pre-packed by specifying "Specified grease" of the special specification on
page 95. For the interval and amount of grease replenishment, see "General description".

Pipe joints
When applying centralized grease or oil lubrication, detach the grease nipple or stop cock from the slide
unit, and replace them with pipe joints, which are prepared for various piping female thread sizes. Use them
after comparing the dimension of the pipe joints and the dimension H3 in the dimension table of each series,
because the top face of some pipe joints is at the same or higher level with the top face of slide unit. Fig.
4.1 and 4.2, Tables 12.1, 12.2, 13.1 and13.2 show model numbers and dimensions of pipe joints. Note that
some of them are not applicable for the slide units of special specifications. Pipe joints can be mounted on
Linear Way and Linear Roller Way prior to delivery upon request. Consult 	for further information.
Remark : The straight type pipe joint shown in Table 12.1 is recommended for female threads (M6 	0.75).

Precautions for Use	Precautions for Use
Mounting structure
The slide unit reference mounting surface is always the side surface opposite to the 	mark. The track
rail reference mounting surface is identified by locating the mark on the top surface of the track rail.
The track rail reference mounting surface is the side surface above themark (in the direction of the
arrow). (See Figs. 7 and 8.)

To mount Linear Way or Linear Roller Way, correctly fit the reference mounting surfaces B and D of the slide
unit and the track rail to the reference mounting surfaces of the table and the bed, and then fix them tightly.
(See Figs. 5 and 6.)
The reference mounting surfaces B and D and mounting surfaces A and C of Linear Way or Linear Roller
Way are accurately finished by grinding. 	Stable and high accuracy linear motion can be obtained by
finishing the mating mounting surfaces of machines or equipment with high accuracy and correctly
mounting the guide on these surfaces.

When a lateral load, alternate load, or fluctuating load is applied to Linear Way or Linear Roller Way, firmly
fix the side faces of the slide unit and track rail as shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10.
When the applied load is small or the operating conditions are not too severe, mounting methods shown in
Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 are also used.

Mounting of Linear Roller Way Super X and Linear Roller Way X slide unit
The general mounting structure of Linear Roller
Way Super X and Linear Roller Way X slide unit
is similar to that shown in Fig. 5. 	Some slide
units are provided with one or two mounting
thread holes in the middle of width (See Fig. 14.)
so that an applied load can be received with
good load balance. 	When designing machines
or 	equipment, 	ensure 	that 	these 	middle
mounting holes of the slide unit can be securely
tightened to obtain maximum performance of
the guide.
Mounting of Linear Way L (For the size 2, 3, 4 and 6)
The general mounting structure of Linear Way L
is similar to that shown in Fig. 5. The slide unit of
this series is mounted by tightening bolts in the
female threads of the slide unit.
For the size 2, 3, 4 and 6 models, the female
threads for mounting the slide unit and the track
rail are through holes. (See Fig. 13.) If the fixing
depth of the mounting bolts is too long, the bolts
will interfere with the slide unit or track rail,
resulting in poor traveling accuracy and short life.
The fixing depth of the mounting bolts should be
kept within the values shown in the table of
dimensions.
The mounting bolts for the track rail are not
appended 	to 	the 	tapped 	rail 	specification
products. Prepare bolts with a fixing depth not
exceeding H4 shown in the dimension table.

Fig. 15 Mounting of Linear Way Module
Mounting of Linear Way Module
Fig. 15 shows the standard mounting structure of Linear Way Module. As a convenient means to eliminate play
or give preload, preload adjusting screws are often used in linear motion rolling guides.
Set the preload adjusting screws at the positions of fixing bolts of slide member and in the middle of the height
of slide member, and then press the slide member by tightening the screw.
For mounting the slide member of Linear Way LM, it is recommended to fix the slide member from the table
side, because the allowance for preload adjustment in the bolt hole of slide member is small. In this case, the
bolt hole and the counter bore in the table should be made larger to give the adjustment allowance.
The preload amount differs depending on the operating conditions of machines or equipment. An excessive
preload will result in short bearing life and raceway damage. The preload amount for general application should
be adjusted to a zero or slight minus clearance in the ideal case.

Accuracy of mounting surfaces
Specifications of mounting parts
The life and other performances of Linear Way and Linear Roller Way are greatly affected by the accuracy of the
mounting surfaces of machines and equipment and the mounting accuracy. 	Poor accuracy may result in
producing a larger load than the calculated load, and eventually lead to short life, etc.
Reliable operation of linear motion rolling guide is ensured by providing high manufacturing and mounting
accuracy of mounting parts and designing a mounting structure so as to keep the accuracy and performance,
while considering the required linear motion accuracy, rigidity and other related operating conditions.
As an example, the standard values of parallelism between two track rail mounting surfaces when multiple sets
are used, are shown in Table 30 on page 126.
Corner radius and shoulder height of reference mounting surfaces
It is recommended to make a relieved fillet at the corner of the mating reference mounting surfaces as shown in
Fig. 16. However, in some series, corner radii R1 and R2 shown in Fig. 17 can also be used. Tables 16.1 to
27.3 show recommended shoulder heights and corner radii of the mating reference mounting surfaces.

mating machine parts as shown in Fig.18,
lubrication can be carried out readily .
Fig.18 Example of lubrication method for Linear Way Module
Operating speed
The limiting values for operating speed of Linear Way or
Linear Roller Way depend on various operating conditions
such as the type of motion, magnitude of applied load,
lubrication conditions, mounting accuracy, and ambient
temperature.
Based on the experiences and actual practice, standard
values of maximum speed under general operating
conditions are given in Table 28 for reference.
Table 28 Standard maximum speed
Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C and a continuous operation is possible at temperatures up to
100˚C. When the temperature exceeds 100˚C, consult 	.
In the case of C-Sleeve Linear Way and the models "with Capillary plates" of special specification, operate
below 80˚C.
Cleaning
Do not wash C-Sleeve Linear Way with organic solvent and/or white kerosene, which have the ability of
removing fat, nor leave them in contact with the above agents.
Oil supply point for lubrication
When lubrication oil is fed by gravity, sufficient amounts of oil may not reach to the raceways which are
located higher than the supply point. 	In such cases, it is necessary to examine the lubrication route and
supply point. Consult 	for further information.

For lateral or upside-down mounting
When mounting Linear Way E or Linear Way F slide units in lateral or reverse (upside-down) position, specify
slide units with under seals ( supplemental code "/U"), if necessary, to prevent foreign particles from
intruding into the slide units.
Multiple slide units mounted in close distance
When multiple slide units are used in close distance to each other, the actual load may be greater than the
calculated load depending on the accuracy of the mounting surfaces and the reference mounting surfaces
of the machine. It is suggested in such cases to assume a greater load than the calculated load.

Assembling of C-Sleeve Linear Way ML and Linear Way L
When assembling C-Sleeve Linear Way ML or Linear Way L, correctly fit the grooves of the slide unit
mounted on a dummy rail (steel ball holder) to the grooves of the track rail, and then move the slide unit
gently from the dummy rail to the track rail in parallel direction.
Steel balls are retained in C-Sleeve Linear Way ML and Linear Way L Ball Retained type, so the slide unit
can be separated freely from the track rail. However, the slide unit can be assembled on the track rail
much easier by using the dummy rail.
The Linear Way L slide unit of interchangeable specification is delivered as assembled on a dummy rail.
In Linear Way L Ball Non-Retained type, steel balls are not retained. When separating the slide unit from
the track rail, a dummy rail (steel ball holder) should be used.
The dummy rail (steel ball holder) is appended as an accessory to models shown in Table 29. The steel
ball holder for other models are also available. If required, consult 	for further information.

Assembling of types other than C-Sleeve Linear Way ML and Linear Way L
When assembling the slide unit on the track rail, correctly fit the grooves of the slide unit to the grooves of
the track rail and move the slide unit gently in parallel direction. Rough handling will result in seal damage
or dropping of steel balls.
The interchangeable specification slide unit is provided with a dummy rail. And, the size 12, 15, 20, 25 and
30 models of Linear Roller Way Super X are appended with a dummy rail. This dummy rail should be used
for assembly.
Mounting accuracy
Cleaning of mounting surfaces
When mounting Linear Way or Linear
Roller Way, first clean all mounting and
reference mounting surfaces. 	(See
Fig. 19.)
Remove burrs and blemishes from
the reference mounting surfaces
and 	mounting 	surfaces 	of 	the
machine or equipment, on which
Linear Way or Linear Roller Way will
be mounted, using an oil-stone,
etc., and then wipe the surfaces
with clean cloth.
Remove rust preventive oil and dirt
from 	the 	reference 	mounting
surfaces and mounting surfaces of
Linear Way or Linear Roller Way
with clean cloth.
Fig. 19 Cleaning of mounting surfaces
Table 30 Parallelism between two mounting surfaces
Inadequate mounting accuracy of Linear Way and Linear Roller Way will affect the operating accuracy and life
adversely, so mounting must be carried out with care. 	When multiple sets are mounted, the parallelism
between the two mounting surfaces of machines must be prepared, in general, as shown in Table 30. In the
case of Linear Way, if mounting parallelism is poor, frictional resistance will steeply increase giving a warning
signal, which can be used to perform high accuracy mounting. For details, see "Mounting" on page 128.
Handling of C-Sleeve Linear Way ML, Linear Way L and Linear Way LM
In C-Sleeve Linear Way ML, Linear Way L Ball Retained type and Linear Way LM, steel balls are retained with a
steel ball retaining band. However, these products must be handled with care to prevent the steel balls from
falling out.

Tightening torque of mounting bolts
The standard torque values for Linear Way and Linear Roller Way mounting bolts are shown in Tables 31.1 and
31.2. 	When machines or equipment are subjected to severe vibration, shock, large fluctuating load, or
moment load, the bolts should be tightened with a torque 1.2 to 1.5 times higher than the standard torque
values shown.
When the mating member material is cast iron or aluminum, tightening torque should be lowered in
accordance with the strength characteristics of the material.

A-2
C-Sleeve Linear Way ML is a linear motion rolling guide, incorporating the C-Sleeve as a
components part for lubrication in the slide unit of miniature type Linear Way L series to achieve
maintenance free operations for a long period of time.
Long-term maintenance free
The lubricant in the C-Sleeve keeps the lubrication
performance for a long period of time and achieves
long-term maintenance free operations. (5 years and
20,000km)
So man-hours for troublesome lubrication control can
be reduced.
Stainless steel made
The metal components are manufactured from
corrosion resistant stainless steel. 	So this series is
most suitable for use in clean rooms and also for
applications where the use of lubricants and rust
preventive oil should be avoided or kept to a minimum.
Ball retained type
The slide unit incorporates ball retaining bands, which
prevent steel balls from dropping when the slide unit is
separated from the track rail. So handling is easy.
Interchangeability
The track rails and the slide units of interchangeable
specification can be handled separately and can be
assembled to make a set as required. Three types of
slide units with different lengths are prepared. The best
type and size can be selected these entire slide units
can be freely assembled on the same track rail.
Lightweight and compact
The C-Sleeve is incorporated in the lightweight and
compact slide unit of miniature type Linear Way L series
without changing the external dimensions of the slide
unit.
Smooth and light motion
As the C-Sleeve is not in contact with the track rail,
frictional resistance does not increase. A smooth and
light motion is ensured.

Structure of C-Sleeve Linear Way ME
C-Sleeve Linear Way ME is a linear motion rolling guide, incorporating the C-Sleeve as a
components part for lubrication in the slide unit of compact type Linear Way E series to achieve
maintenance free operations for a long period of time.
Long-term maintenance free
The lubricant in the C-Sleeve keeps the lubrication
performance for a long period of time and achieves
long-term maintenance free operations. (5 years and
20,000km)
So man-hours for troublesome lubrication control can
be reduced.
Various lengths of slide unit
In addition to the standard slide unit, a short type slide
unit and a high rigidity long type slide unit both having
the same sectional dimensions with the standard slide
unit are available.
Flange type and block type
Slide units are available in three different sectional
shapes; two flange types for different mounting
directions and one block type with a narrow width.
Interchangeability
The track rails and the slide units of interchangeable
specification can be handled separately and can be
assembled to make a set as required. Three types of
slide units with different lengths are prepared. The best
type and size can be selected these entire slide units
can be freely assembled on the same track rail.
Lightweight and compact
The C-Sleeve is incorporated in the lightweight and
compact slide unit of miniature type Linear Way E series
without changing the external dimensions of the slide
unit.
Smooth and light motion
As the C-Sleeve is not in contact with the track rail,
frictional resistance does not increase. A smooth and
light motion is ensured.

Table 11 Standard and maximum lengths of high carbon track rails
Track rail length
Standard and maximum lengths of track rail are shown in Table 11.
Track rail in any lengths are also available. Simply indicate the necessary length of track rail in millimeter
(mm) in the identification number.
In non-interchangeable specification, for track rail longer than the maximum length shown in Table 11,
butt-jointing track rails are available upon request. In this case, indicate supplemental code "/A" in the
identification number.
E dimensions at both ends are the same unless otherwise specified. To change these dimensions,
specify the specified rail mounting hole positions (supplemental code "/E") of special specification. For
detail, see page 89.

Structure of C-Sleeve Linear Way MH
C-Sleeve Linear Way MH features the largest load ratings and rigidity among all ball types and
incorporating the C-Sleeve as a components part for lubrication in the slide unit to achieve
maintenance free operations for a long period of time.
Long-term maintenance free
The lubricant in the C-Sleeve keeps the lubrication
performance for a long period of time and achieves
long-term maintenance free operations. (5 years and
20,000km) 	So man-hours for troublesome lubrication
control can be reduced.
Smooth and light motion
As the C-Sleeve is not in contact with the track rail,
frictional resistance does not increase. A smooth and
light motion is ensured.
Flange type and block type
Four kinds of slide units are available; two flange types
for different mounting directions and two kinds of
narrow block type with different height and mounting
dimensions.
Length of slide unit
A standard type slide unit and a high rigidity long type
slide unit both having the same sectional dimensions
are available.
Interchangeability
Interchangeable specification is also available. The track
rails and the slide units of interchangeable specification
can be handled separately and can be assembled to
make a set as required. Two types of slide units with
different lengths are prepared. The best type and size
can be selected these entire slide units can be freely
assembled on the same track rail.
Light weight and compact
The C-Sleeve is incorporated in the slide unit of High
Rigidity type Linear Way H series without changing the
external dimensions of the slide unit.

Structure of C-Sleeve Linear Way MUL
C-Sleeve Linear Way MUL is a linear motion rolling guide, incorporating the C-Sleeve as a
components part for lubrication in the slide unit of miniature type Linear Way LWUL series to achieve
maintenance free operations for a long period of time.
Long-term maintenance free
The lubricant in the C-Sleeve keeps the lubrication
performance for a long period of time and achieves
long-term maintenance free operations. (5 years and
20,000km)
So man-hours for troublesome lubrication control can
be reduced.
Stainless steel made
The metal components are manufactured from
corrosion resistant stainless steel. 	So this series is
most suitable for use in clean rooms and also for
applications where the use of lubricants and rust
preventive oil should be avoided or kept to a minimum.
U-shaped track rail
Rigidity of track rail under moment and torsion is very
much increased by adopting the U-shaped design. The
track rail can, therefore, be mounted on machines and
equipment as structural members, either in a cantilever
position or supported at both ends, so they can be
combined an assembled freely.
Lightweight and compact
The C-Sleeve is incorporated in the lightweight and
compact slide unit of miniature type Linear Way LWLU
series without changing the external dimensions of the
slide unit.
Smooth and light motion
As the C-Sleeve is not in contact with the track rail,
frictional resistance does not increase. A smooth and
light motion is ensured.

LWLLWLF
Linear Way L is a miniature type linear motion rolling guide, incorporating two rows of steel balls
arranged in four point contact with the raceways. 	Although it is small in size, it provides stable
accuracy and rigidity owing to its simple design even in operations under fluctuating loads with
changing direction and magnitude or complex loads. The standard products are made from stainless
steel, and a wide range of variations in shapes and sizes are available for selections suitable for each
application.
Interchangeable
The ball-retained type includes interchangeable
specification products. The dimensions of slide units
and track rails of this specification are individually
controlled, so that the slide units and track rails can be
combined, added or exchanged freely.
Stainless steel type and high carbon steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance and is most suitable for 	machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical 	equipment, disk read devices, and semi-
conductor manufacturing equipment.
The high carbon steel type permits additional working to
track rails and is used for general purpose applications
such as material transfer machines and handling
equipment.
Ball retained type
The slide unit of ball retained type incorporates ball
retaining bands, which prevent steel balls from dropping
when the slide unit is separated from the track rail. So
handling is easy.
Tapped rail specification
In addition to the standard specification track rail which
is fixed by inserting bolts downward in the mounting
holes, the tapped rail specification track rail that has
tapped screw holes is available, so an optimum
mounting direction can be selected, giving more
freedom in machine design.
Standard type and wide rail type
Slide units and track rails are provided in two widths:
standard type and wide rail type. The wide rail type is
suitable for single row rail arrangement.
Length of slide unit
The slide unit of stainless steel, ball retained type is
further classified into three types: short type, standard
type and high rigidity long type. All of these slide units
are equal in sectional dimensions but different in slide
unit lengths, which can be selected suiting the
requirements in each application.

Track rail length
Standard and maximum lengths of track rails are shown in Tables 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3. Track rails in any
length are also available. Simply indicate the necessary length of track rail in mm in the identification number.
For the tolerances of E dimension and track rail length, consult 	for further information.
For non-interchangeable track rails longer than the maximum length shown in Tables 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3, butt-jointing track rails are available upon request. In this case, indicate "A" in the identification
number.
E dimensions at both ends are the same and are within the standard range of E unless otherwise
specified. 	To change these dimensions, specify the specified rail mounting hole positions "E" of
special specification. For details, see page 89.

Linear Way L : Wide rail type

-- 202 of 706 --

B-28
Linear Way E is a linear motion rolling guide, featuring a compact slide unit which performs
endless linear motion along a track rail. Two rows of steel balls are arranged in four point contact
with the raceways. 	This design ensures stable high accuracy and rigidity in operations even under
fluctuating loads with changing direction and magnitude or complex loads. A wide range of variations
in shapes and sizes are available. This series is a compact type suitable for general applications.
Interchangeable
Linear Way E includes interchangeable specification
products. The dimensions of slide units and track rails
of this specification are individually controlled, so that
the slide units and track rails can be combined, added
or exchanged freely.
Variable lengths of slide unit
In addition to the standard slide unit, a short type slide
unit and a high rigidity long type slide unit both having
the same sectional dimensions with the standard slide
unit are available.
Stainless steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance and is most suitable for machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical 	equipment, disk read devices and semi-
conductor manufacturing equipment.
Compact design
Lower, narrower, and shorter. Compactness has been
pursued in every dimension.
Flange type and block type
Slide units are available in three different sectional
shapes; two flange types for different mounting
directions and one block type with a narrow width.

Track rail length
Standard and maximum lengths of track rails are shown in Tables 12.1 and 12.2. Track rails in any length
are also available. Simply indicate the necessary length of track rail in mm in the identification number.
For the tolerances of E dimension and track rail length, consult 	for further information.
For non-interchangeable track rails longer than the maximum length shown in Tables 12.1 and 12.2,
butt-jointing track rails are available upon request. 	In this case, indicate "/A" in the identification
number.
E dimensions at both ends are the same and are within the standard range of E unless otherwise
specified. 	To change these dimensions, specify the specified rail mounting hole positions 	"/ E" 	of
special specification. For details, see page 89.

Linear Way E : Block type

-- 222 of 706 --

B-54
Low Decibel Linear Way E is a linear motion rolling guide for smooth and quiet motion. Its low
noise characteristic has been achieved by adopting optimum design based on a thorough analysis of
ball recirculation behavior and sound quality. Plastic separators are incorporated to eliminate direct
contact between balls and thus achieve smooth and quiet motion.
Low Decibel Linear Way E is suitable for production equipment or machinery, in which a large number
of linear motion rolling guides are incorporated, and can be used to help reduce the noise level in
factory and create a human-friendly environment.
Low decibel
Plastic separators are incorporated to eliminate direct
contact between balls and thus achieve smooth and
quiet motion.
Flange type and block type
Slide units are available in three different sectional
shapes; two flange types for different mounting
directions and one block type with a narrow width.
Dimensional interchangeability with
Linear Way E
The mounting dimensions are the same as those of
Linear Way E. So this guide can replace Linear Way E
(LWE) with little modifications of machines or
equipment.
Compact design
Lower, narrower, and shorter. Compactness has been
pursued in every dimension.

Low Decibel Linear Way E: Block type

-- 237 of 706 --

B-72
Linear Way H incorporates two rows of large diameter steel balls in four point contact with the
raceways and provides stable high accuracy and rigidity in operations even under fluctuating loads
with changing direction and magnitude or complex loads. This series features the largest load ratings
and rigidity among all ball types. 	A wide range of variations in shapes and sizes are available for
selecting a model suitable for each application.
Interchangeable
Linear Way H includes interchangeable specification
products.
The dimensions of slide units and track rails of this
specification are individually controlled, so that the slide
units and track rails can be combined, added or
exchanged freely.
Stainless steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance and is most suitable for machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical 	equipment, disk read devices and semi-
conductor manufacturing equipment.
Ultra sealed specification
The track rail of this specification is ground on all
surfaces, and is combined with a slide unit with
specially designed end seals and under seals. Excellent
dust protection performance is provided.
Miniature size
Miniature size models with track rail widths of 8 mm, 10
mm and 12 mm are available for use in the extended
application range of Linear Way H.
Flange type and block type
Slide units are available in five different sectional
shapes: two flange types for different mounting
directions and three narrow block types that are
different in height and mounting directions.
Length of slide unit
A standard type slide unit and a high rigidity long type
slide unit both having the same sectional dimensions
are available.

Track rail length
Standard and maximum lengths of track rails are shown in Tables 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3. Track rails of any
length are also available. Simply indicate the required length of track rail in mm in the identification number.
For the tolerances of E dimension and track rail length, consult 	for further information.
For track rails of non-interchangeable specification longer than the maximum length shown in Tables
11.1, 11.2 and 11.3, butt-jointing track rails are available upon request. In this case, indicate "/A" in the
identification number.
E dimensions at both ends are the same and are within the standard range of E unless otherwise specified.
To change these dimensions, specify the specified rail mounting hole positions "/E" of special specification.
For details, see page 89.

Table12 Dimensions of ultra sealed type track rails mounted from the lower side
Specification of ultra sealed type track rail mounted from the lower side
In this specification, aluminum caps are press-fitted into the track rail mounting holes in advance and the
track rail is fixed from the mounting surface side. As the top surface of the track rail is flat, close contact
with seals can be obtained, further improving the sealing effect.

Linear Way H : Side mounting type

-- 265 of 706 --

B-108
Linear Way F is a linear motion rolling guide, featuring a wide track rail along which a highly rigid
slide unit performs endless linear motion. 	A large number of large diameter steel balls are
incorporated in two rows and in four point contact with the raceways, so stable high accuracy and
rigidity can be obtained in operations even under fluctuating loads with changing direction and
magnitude or complex loads. 	Being a wide rail type, it can support a large moment load acting
around the axial direction, and it is also suitable for single row rail arrangement.
Wide structure
Because the distance between the load points under a
moment load is large, this guide has high load capacity
under moment load and complex load.
Stainless steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance and is the most suitable for machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical equipment, disk read devices and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.
Good load balance
Owing to the simple two row design, large diameter
steel balls are incorporated to receive loads in all
directions with high load ratings.
High rigidity
Steel balls are arranged in four point contact with the
raceways in a highly rigid casing, and they are tightly
held in their position without play. So high rigidity in all
directions is obtained.
Flange type and block type
Three types of slide units are available; two flange types
of different dimension series and one block type with a
narrower width.
Interchangeable
Linear Way F includes interchangeable specification
products. The dimensions of slide units and track rails
of this specification are individually controlled, so that
the slide units and track rails can be combined, added
or exchanged freely.

Track rail length
Standard and maximum lengths of track rails are shown in Table 11.1 and 11.2. Track rails of any length are
also available. Simply indicate the required length of track rail in mm in the identification number.
For the tolerances of E dimension and track rail length, consult 	for further information.
For track rails longer than the maximum length shown in Table 11.1 and 11.2, butt-jointing track rails
are available upon request. In this case, indicate "/A" in the identification number.
E dimensions at both ends are the same and are within the standard range of E unless otherwise
specified. 	To change these dimensions, specify the specified rail mounting hole positions "/E" of
special specification. For details, see page 89.

Linear Way U is a linear motion rolling guide featuring a track rail with a U-shaped cross section.
Raceways are provided on the inside surface of the track rail, and a slide unit mounted inside the
track rail travels along the raceways.
The U-shaped track rail has much higher rigidity as compared with the track rail with a rectangular
cross section, especially under moment and torsion. Therefore, in addition to the conventional way of
fastening a track rail on a mounting base, it can be used by itself as a structural member of machines
and equipment, in a cantilever position or being supported at both ends.
U-shaped track rail
Rigidity of track rail under moment and torsion is very
much increased by adopting the U-shaped design. The
track rails can, therefore, be mounted on machines and
equipment as structural members, either in a cantilever
position or supported at both ends, so they can be
combined and assembled freely.
Ball retained type
The slide unit of ball retained type incorporates ball
retaining bands, which prevent steel balls from dropping
when the slide unit is separated from the track rail. So
handling is easy.
Additional work on track rail is possible
Additional work can be made on track rails of standard
type, so that drive mechanisms and other peripheral
devices can be fixed directly to the track rails.
( 	Note that additional work cannot be made near the
raceways of track rail. For details, consult 	for further
information.)
High precision and rigidity
Large diameter steel balls in the slide unit are arranged
in two rows, and makes contact with the raceways at
four points. Stable high precision and rigidity are thus
obtained even under fluctuating loads with changing
direction and magnitude or complex loads.

Linear Way Module is a compact linear motion rolling guide for endless linear motion, and
consists of a set of track rail and slide member which forms the smallest unit of linear motion
mechanism. 	Various models are available for selection suitable for each application. In general, two
sets are used in parallel.
Compact
The one row, four point contact design has achieved a
compact product, which can be mounted in a very small
space. 	It can be easily adapted to the structure of
machines and equipment, providing a high degree of
freedom in machine design.
Low height
As the sectional height is low, Linear Way Modules can
be easily adapted to the structure of machines and
equipment.
Linear Way M
Linear Way M is a standard type, incorporating steel
balls as rolling elements.
Linear Way LM
As stainless steel components are used, Linear Way LM
has excellent corrosion resistance and is most suitable
for 	machines 	and 	equipment 	used 	in 	clean
environments, for example, medical equipment, disk
read devices, and semi-conductor manufacturing
equipment.
Linear Roller Way M
High rigidity cylindrical rollers are alternately crossed at
right angles to each other. This product is suitable for
applications with heavy loads and shock loads.

C-2
Linear Roller Way Super X is a high performance roller type linear motion rolling guide, featuring
high reliability, high rigidity, high accuracy, and smooth motion. Four rows of cylindrical rollers are
incorporated in a highly rigid casing with good balance, and the cylindrical rollers in each row are
arranged in parallel to each other. Owing to its small elastic deformation, stable operation is ensured
even under heavy or fluctuating loads. This series is also suitable for applications with vibration and
shocks. Various models and sizes are available to meet requirements in each application.
Interchangeable
Linear Roller Way Super X includes interchangeable
specification products. 	The dimensions of slide units
and track rails of this specification are individually
controlled, so that the slide units and track rails can be
combined, added or exchanged freely.
Flange type and block type
Slide units are available in two different sectional
shapes: the flange type for mounting from both upper
and lower sides and the block type with a narrow width.
Dimensional interchangeability with the ball type
The mounting dimensions are the same as those of ball
type Linear Way H. So this guide can replace the ball
type with little modifications of machines or equipment.
Variable length of slide unit
Three types of slide units, the short slide unit, the
standard slide unit and the high rigidity long slide unit
with the same sectional dimensions are available for
selection suitable for each application. Stainless steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance, and is best suited for machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical equipment and semi-conductor manufacturing
equipment.

Rigidity of Linear Roller Way Super X (Reference Values)
Linear Roller Way Super X has the highest rigidity among all the Linear Way and Linear Roller Way series.
Deflection due to elastic deformations at the contact area of the rolling element and in the structural
members under external load is very small.
Typical experimental data on the relations between the load and the deflection for various preload amounts
and load directions are shown below as reference values.

Linear Roller Way Super X : Compact block type

-- 329 of 706 --

C-34
Linear Roller Way X is a linear motion rolling guide which achieves smooth linear motion with
high accuracy and rigidity. 	Four rows of cylindrical rollers are arranged in its casing with good
balance, so elastic deformation is small and stable operation is ensured even under heavy or
fluctuating loads. This product is suitable for applications with vibration and shocks.
High rigidity and excellent vibration damping performance
As a large number of parallel cylindrical rollers are
arranged in a highly rigid casing with good balance,
high rigidity as well as excellent vibration damping
performance can be obtained.
Block type and flange type
Slide units are available in two different sectional
shapes: the block type and the flange type for different
mounting directions.

The dimensions of spline shafts and external cylinders (or slide units) of the interchangeable specification
are individually controlled, so that the spline shafts and external cylinders (or slide units) can be combined,
added or exchanged freely. (Linear Ball Spline G series and Block type Linear Ball Spline series)
Wide variations
Size variations range from a very small size with shaft diameter of 2 mm to larger sizes up to 50 mm. Three
types of external cylinders (including one slide unit type) are also available: standard type, flange type and
block type.
These products can be selected to meet the requirements for each application.
Compact design with high rigidity
Large diameter steel balls are arranged in two rows and in four point contact with the raceways, achieving
compact design with high rigidity. (Linear Ball Spline G series and Block type Linear Ball Spline series)
High positioning accuracy
By applying a suitable preload, clearance in the rotational direction is eliminated. So high positioning
accuracy in the rotational direction can be obtained.
Smooth motion with low friction
The steel ball re-circulation was thoroughly analyzed, resulting in an optimal design of re-circulation route
through end caps. High speed operation as well as smooth motion with low friction can be achieved.
Linear Ball Spline is a linear motion rolling guide which achieves endless linear
motion of an external cylinder along a spline shaft. As steel balls make rolling contact with
the spline grooves, radial loads as well as rotating torque can be received. This product is
most suitable for mechanisms that perform linear motion while transmitting rotating torque.
The spline grooves have almost the same radius of curvature as that of steel balls, and can
receive a large load. This product has a large load capacity and will be useful for achieving
compact design of machines and equipment.

Interchangeable Specification
Linear Ball Spline include interchangeable specification products. The spline shafts
and the external cylinders (or the slide units) of this specification can be handled separately
and can be assembled to make a set as required.
The 	interchangeable 	specification 	guides 	are 	produced 	with 	the 	original 	precision
manufacturing technology, making the most of the 	guide designs: namely, the simple
two-row raceway and four-point contact ball design. 	The dimensional accuracy of both
external cylinders (or slide units) and spline shafts is strictly controlled to achieve the
interchangeability of higher standard.
A new product selection system is offered,
in which external cylinders (or slide units) and
spline shafts can be selected separately,
as and when required !!

The outer peripheral surface of the spline shaft, and the reference mounting surface D and mounting surface
C of the slide unit of Block type Linear Ball Spline are accurately finished by grinding as shown in Fig. 8.
Stable and high accuracy linear motion can be obtained by finishing the mating mounting surfaces of
machines or equipment with high accuracy and correctly mounting the Linear Ball Spline on these surfaces.
It is recommended to make a relieved fillet at the corner of the mating reference mounting surface as shown
in Table 14. Table 14 shows the recommended shoulder height of the mating reference mounting surface.

Number of external cylinders
Table 15 Arrangement of flange type external cylinders of Linear Ball Spline G (Non-interchangeable specification)
When using multiple external cylinders or slide units in close distance to each other, actual load may be
greater than the calculated load depending on the accuracy of the mounting surfaces and the reference
mounting surfaces of the machine. It is suggested in such cases to assume a greater load than the calculated
load.
For Linear Ball Spline G, the key grooves of the external cylinders are aligned before delivery, when two or
more external cylinders are assembled on a single spline shaft and two or more keys are used to fix the
external cylinders in the rotational direction.
For Block type Linear Ball Spline, dimensional variations of H and N among a set can be specified upon
request. Consult 	for further information.
Multiple flange type external cylinders of non-interchangeable Linear Ball Spline G are arranged as shown in
Table 15. Other arrangements are also available. Consult 	for further information.
The maximum operating temperature is 120 C and a continuous operation is possible at temperatures up to
100 C. When the temperature exceeds 100 C, consult 	.
In case of "With capillary plates" of special specification, operate below 80 C.

Assembling Linear Ball Spline G
When assembling the external cylinder on the spline shaft, correctly fit the grooves of the external cylinder
to the grooves of the spline shaft and move the external cylinder gently in parallel direction. Rough handling
will result in seal damage or dropping of steel balls.
Non-interchangeable specification products are already assembled so as to provide the best accuracy
when the external cylinder 	mark and the spline shaft 	mark face the same direction. (See Fig. 9.)
So make sure not to change the assembly direction.
When press-fitting the external cylinder of Linear Ball
Spline G to the housing, assemble them correctly
using a press and a suitable jig fixture, etc. (See Fig.
10.)

The standard torque values for Block type Linear Ball Spline fixing bolts are shown in Table 16. When
machines or equipment are subjected to severe vibration, shock, large fluctuating load, or moment load, the
bolts should be tightened with a torque 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than the standard torque values shown.
When the mating member material is cast iron or aluminum, tightening torque should be reduced in
accordance with the strength characteristics of the material.

Linear Ball Spline G is a linear motion rolling guide which achieves endless linear motion of an
external cylinder along a spline shaft. Two rows of steel balls are arranged in four point contact with
the raceways. Stable high accuracy and rigidity are ensured in operations even under fluctuating
loads with changing direction and magnitude or complex loads. 	Owing to its simple design, this
product is very compact.
Interchangeable
Linear Ball Spline G includes interchangeable
specification products. 	The dimensions of external
cylinders and spline shafts of this specification are
individually controlled, so that the external cylinders and
spline shafts can be combined, added or exchanged
freely.
Length of external cylinder
External cylinders of both standard type and flange type
are available in two different lengths: standard and high
rigidity long. They can be selected for wide applications.
Solid shaft and hollow shaft
Two types of spline shaft, the solid shaft and the hollow
shaft are available for selection suitable for each
application.
Standard type and flange type
External cylinders are available in two different shapes:
the standard type (cylindrical shape) and the flange
type.

D-46
Block type Linear Ball Spline is a linear motion rolling guide, featuring a slide unit which
performs endless linear motion along a spline shaft. 	Two rows of steel balls are arranged in four
point contact with the raceways. This design ensures stable high accuracy and rigidity in operations
even under fluctuating loads with changing direction and magnitude or complex loads.
Interchangeable
All models in this series are interchangeable
specification products. The dimensions of slide units
and spline shafts are individually controlled, so that the
spline shafts and slide units can be combined, added or
exchanged freely.
Stainless steel type
The stainless steel type has excellent corrosion
resistance and is most suitable for machines and
equipment used in clean environments, for example,
medical equipment, measuring instruments, and semi-
conductor manufacturing equipment.
Hollow shaft
In high carbon steel type, hollow shafts are also
available in addition to solid shafts. The hollow shafts
are suitable for applications in which piping, wiring or
ventilation is needed.
Easy mounting
The slide unit is provided with threaded mounting holes
for easy mounting on machines or equipment with bolts.

Angular type Linear Ball Spline is a linear motion rolling guide, featuring a spline shaft with six
rows of raceways along which an external cylinder performs endless linear motion by re-circulating
steel balls inside the external cylinder body. The shaft sectional area is designed as large as possible
to achieve high shaft rigidity.
Solid shaft and hollow shaft
Two types of spline shaft, the solid shaft and the hollow
shaft are available for selection suitable for each
application.
Standard type and flange type
External cylinders are available in two different shapes:
the standard type (cylindrical shape) and the flange
type.

Crossed Roller Way is a linear motion rolling guide in which a roller cage is incorporated between
two ways with V-shaped raceways. As the cylindrical rollers are alternately crossed, Crossed Roller
Way can receive loads in any direction and can achieve very smooth linear motion with very high
accuracy.
Wide variations in size are available for selections suitable for each application.
Standard type and module type
Two types are available: the standard type and the
module type. In the standard type four ways and two
roller cages are used as one set, while in the module
type two inner ways are integrated into a single piece.
High carbon chromium bearing steel
type and stainless steel type
Standard types include high carbon chromium bearing
steel type and stainless steel type.
Easy mounting
The mounting holes of the ways are female thread holes
with a counter bore. 	So the mounting method is
flexible, allowing the ways to be mounted either by
using the female threads of the ways together with bolts
inserted through the holes prepared on machines or by
using the female threads prepared on machines.
Mounting structure can be designed freely.
Two inner ways of module type are integrated into a single
piece. The mounting structure can be made simple and,
furthermore, as errors from extra machining of the
mounting parts can be avoided, accuracy of linear motion
can be improved.
U.S. PATNET No. 4,697,935
Very smooth operation
Precisely finished raceways are combined with roller
cages, in which the length of super precise rollers is
accurately controlled to avoid skewing. Very smooth
linear motion with very little frictional resistance and free
from stick-slip can be achieved.

Special mounting screws B
Since the way at the adjusting side moves when the preload is set, some clearance between the mounting
screw and the mounting hole is necessary. However, if sufficient clearance can not be provided or if the
mounting screw is fixed from the way side to the table as shown in Fig. 2, special mounting screws may be
needed.
Further, if the positioning accuracy of mounting holes in table or bed are not good, special screws can also
be used. 	The special mounting screws are delivered as appended parts upon request, but available in
carbon steel type only.

High rigidity roller cage M
High rigidity cages made of copper alloy,
which 	are 	suitable 	for 	use 	in 	vertical
applications, are optionally available. 	This
cage is designed to prevent rollers from falling
out in one direction. (See Fig. 3.)
For vertical usage, it is recommended to use
this cage together with the end stopper SB.
Fig. 3 High rigidity cage
End stopper SA SA
When the cage is stroked frequently or subjected to vibration or unevenly distributed load, the cage position
may shift while in operation. 	It is recommended, in such cases, to replace the end screw with the end
stopper SA.
Size 1 models are assembled with stoppers similar to the SA end stopper as standard.

End stopper SB SB
When the high rigidity cage is used on a vertical axis, the end screw is replaced with the end stopper SB to
limit the stroking of the cage at the way end.
The end stopper SB can not be mounted on all ends of the ways in the assembly. Fig. 4 shows the standard
mounting arrangement. The mounting arrangement can be changed by loosening screws and resetting the
end stoppers.

Basic dynamic load rating
C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which
a group of identical Crossed Roller Ways are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group can
travel 100 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
Basic static load rating
C 0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.
Allowable load
F
The allowable load is a load under which the sum of elastic deformations of the rolling element and the
raceway in the contact area subjected to the maximum contact stress is small enough to guarantee
accuracy and smooth rolling movement.
Therefore, when very smooth and highly accurate linear motion is required, make sure that the applied load
is well within the allowable load value.
Calculation of load ratings and allowable load
In Crossed Roller Way, the number of cylindrical rollers sharing a load differs according to the load direction.
Therefore, it is necessary to obtain load ratings and allowable load for each direction.
The basic dynamic load rating CU , basic static load rating C0U and allowable load FU shown in the table of
dimensions indicate values per one roller.
The basic dynamic load rating C, basic static load rating C0 and allowable load F of Crossed Roller Way are
obtained from the formulae shown in Tables 8.1 and 8.2.
Summarized descriptions of load ratings of Crossed Roller Way are given below. For details of load rating
definitions and load calculations, see "General description".

Stroke length and number of rollers
When selecting the specification of Crossed Roller Way, stroke length and number of rollers should be
considered as well as the accuracy, load ratings and allowable load.
Stroke length of Crossed Roller Way is related to the way length and number of rollers in a roller cage, etc.
Therefore, selection procedure is as follows while considering the operating stroke length and applied loads.
Way length is generally more than 1.5 times of operating
stroke length and is obtained from the following formula.
where, 	L: Way length, mm
S: Operating stroke length, mm
It is suggested that the operating stroke length is 80% or less of the maximum stroke length. The maximum
stroke length is obtained from the following formula.

From formula (9) in Table 8.2 on page E-13, allowable load F in parallel usage is;
(allowable load per one roller FU = 764 N from dimension tables)
In the calculation result, the allowable load F is larger than the applied load P = 7000 N. Therefore, this
model can be used within the allowable load. If the applied load exceeds the calculated allowable load,
it is necessary to consider increasing the way length and number of rollers, or to select a model with larger
diameter rollers.
Therefore, number of rollers Z = 20 in one cage is obtained by disregarding any decimal.
As a result of the above calculations, CRW 6-300 with 20 rollers is suitable.
The selected model number is CRW 6-300 C20.
From formula (13), number of rollers in one cage is;
(DW = 6 mm and p = 9 mm from dimension tables)
From formula (12), allowable distance between rollers at both ends in one cage LR is;
From formula (11), maximum stroke length S1 is;
Therefore, standard way length L = 300 mm is selected from dimension tables.
From formula (10), way length L is;
Model 	CRW 6
Applied load 	P 	7000 N
Stroke length 	S 	195 mm
For parallel use of Crossed Roller Ways under the above specified conditions (See Fig. 12 on page E-21.),

Oil or grease is used as a lubricant for Crossed Roller Way. 	Oil is generally used for high speed or low
friction operation. 	On the other hand, grease is used when operating speed is low. 	In case of grease
lubrication, a good quality lithium-soap base grease is recommended. 	When operation speed is low and
load is light, coat the raceways with grease before use and relubricate periodically. Structure shown in Fig.
6 makes the relubrication easy.
Crossed Roller Ways are finished very accurately. 	However, if dust or foreign particles intrude, life and
accuracy will be adversely affected. 	In order to prevent the intrusion of dust, dirt, water, etc., it is
recommended to use non-contact type shields (labyrinth seal) as shown in Fig. 7 or contact type wiper seals
shown in Fig.8 at the outside of installed unit.

Check whether the specification of selected Crossed Roller Way meets the requirements for the application
of the machine or equipment.
Crossed Roller Way is a high precision product, so handle it with care. The cage can be modified by cutting
it to the required cage length. When cutting, do not deform the cage.
The general configurations of mating mounting surfaces for CRW and CRWM are shown in Figs. 9.1 and
9.2, respectively.
Accuracy of the mating mounting surfaces is, in general, as shown in Table 9. 	The accuracy of mating
mounting surfaces directly affects the operating accuracy and performance of Crossed Roller Way. 	If
very high operating accuracy is required, higher accuracy of mating mounting surfaces than the values
shown in Table 9 may be needed.

Preload adjusting screws are generally used for setting preload, as shown in Fig. 10. The size of the preload
adjusting screws are the same as that of the mounting screws for the ways. The position of the preload
adjusting screws is at the same position as the mounting screws of the ways. For centering, use half
of way height H.
Preload amounts differ according to the application of machine or equipment. 	Excessive preloads
deteriorate life and often damage the raceways. 	Therefore, zero or minimal preload is recommended in
general. 	If accuracy and rigidity are important, a setting plate as shown in Fig. 11.1 or a tapered jib as
shown in Fig. 11.2 may be used.

Tightening torque of mounting screws is shown in Table 10. If vibration or shock is large, or moment load is
applied, it is recommended to tighten the screws to about 1.3 times the values shown in Table 10. 	If
vibration and shock are not present and high operating accuracy is needed, a lower tightening torque than
the values shown in Table 10 is suggested. In this case, adhesive or lock-screws may be used to prevent
any subsequent loosening of the mounting screws.
Crossed Roller Way does not contain synthetic resin parts and can be operated at high temperatures.
But, when the temperature exceeds 100˚C, consult 	.
The operating speed of Crossed Roller Way should not exceed 30 m/min.

Mounting of ways at bed side (Fig. 14)	3
After fitting the mounting surfaces of ways
onto the mating mounting surfaces of bed,
temporarily tighten the mounting screws
with uniform tightening torque.
After closely fitting the ways to B surfaces
(See Fig. 13.), tighten the mounting screws
uniformly to the prescribed tightening torque.
If high accuracy is required, tighten the
mounting 	screws 	uniformly 	to 	the
prescribed 	tightening 	torque 	while
checking the parallelism of the two ways
along the overall way length.
General tightening torque of mounting

tighten the mounting screws at the fixed
side with uniform tightening torque.
After closely fitting the way at the fixed side
to C surface, tighten the mounting screws
at the fixed side uniformly to the prescribed
tightening torque.
Loosen the preload adjusting screws and
temporarily tighten the mounting screws of
the way at adjusting side with uniform and
light tightening torque.
Adjust the positions of table and bed in
height and width directions in order to
insert roller cages between the ways at
table side and bed side.
Insert the roller cages gradually and
gently until the cages position roughly at
the center of way length. In this process,
do not deform the cages.
Assemble end screws or end stoppers.
Push the table to the preload adjusting
side, and temporarily tighten the preload
adjusting screws until the clearance at
raceways is near zero.
Gently stroke the table its full stroke length
to position the roller cage at the center of
the stroke.

CRW, CRWM
When adjusting the screws close to the end of the way, gradually stroke the table and ensure that the roller
cage is positioned at the adjusting screw.
Using the above process, the internal clearance becomes zero or minimal preload, but the preload amount
is not uniform along the way length. Therefore, repeat the same process and tighten all adjusting screws
uniformly to the recorded tightening torque.
The mounting screws have been tightened lightly to a uniform torque. Similar to the adjustment of
the preload adjusting screws, temporarily tighten the mounting screws at the adjusting side to a
slightly lower tightening torque than the prescribed value. 	Start from the center screw of the way
length and proceed alternately to the left and right.
When tightening the mounting screws close to the end of the way, gradually stroke the table and ensure
that the roller cage is positioned at the mounting screw.
Finally, tighten all mounting screws at the adjusting side uniformly to the prescribed torque similar to the
adjustment of the preload adjusting screws.
Preload adjustment (Fig. 17)	6
Final fixing of way at adjusting side	7
Final check (Fig. 18)	8
Preload adjustment is done only when
mounting screws for the way at the
adjusting side are temporarily tightened.
Preload adjustment is started from the
adjusting screw at the center of the way
length, proceeding alternately to the left
and right.
While checking the clearance (deflection)
at the side face of table, tighten each
adjusting 	screw 	lightly 	to 	a 	uniform
amount, then repeat the same process applying a higher tightening torque until a dial gauge indicates
zero-clearance (no more change in deflection). Record the tightening torque of the adjusting screws at
zero-clearance.
Stroke the table gradually its full stroke
length, ensuring that the stroke is smooth
and quiet.
Check the operating accuracy by measuring
the upper and side faces of table with a dial
gauge.

apply rust preventive oil or lubricating oil.
Use the same procedure as that for CRW.
Roughly position the center way to the mounting surface of bed and lightly tighten the mounting screws.
Temporarily tighten the mounting screws with uniform tightening torque while adjusting the position of the
center way by checking the parallelism between the datum surface in the operating direction and the
raceways of the center way with a dial gauge.

Drilling for dowel pin hole (Fig. 21)	4
If dowel pins are needed to fix the center way to the bed, drill holes to the bed through the dowel pin holes
of the center way while assembling the center way on the bed and locating the drill tool to dowel pin holes
near the way ends. The holes for dowel pins in the center way are manufactured to H7 tolerance.
Therefore, the holes in bed should have the same tolerance.
Hole diameters and their tolerances are shown in the dimension tables.
Remove any drilling chips and, if necessary, wash again the table assembly. If the table assembly of the
machine is large, first disassemble the center way. 	Then wash the table and the center way individually
before re-assembly.
Insert dowel pins and check the parallelism between the datum surface in the operating direction and the
raceways of the center way.

Structure of Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way
Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way is the product with a cage creep proof function using a
rack and pinion mechanism originated from 	Crossed Roller Way, featuring smooth linear motion
with super high accuracy.
Reliable running performance
Perfect solution for cage creeping problems by a built in
rack and pinion mechanism as an 	original design.
Energy-saving in operation
Any corrective operation for cage creeping is not
necessary even for a long-time operation.
Smooth operation
Precisely finished raceways are combined with roller
cages, in which the length of super precise roller is
accurately controlled to avoid skewing. Very smooth
linear motion with very little frictional resistance and free
from stick-slip can be achieved.
Easy mounting
The mounting holes of the ways are female thread holes
with a counter bore. 	So the mounting method is
flexible, allowing the ways to be mounted either by
inserted through the holes prepared on machines.
Mounting structure can be designed freely.
Freedom in mounting
This series is reliable for applications such as a vertical
axis for which the existing Crossed Roller Way is not
easy to use.
Applicable to high-speed and high-tact operation
Any corrective operation for cage creeping is not
necessary even for a long-time operation.
Interchangeable in dimensions
It has full interchangeability with the existing Crossed
Roller Way in mounting dimension. Since the series has
the same external dimensions to those of the existing
Crossed Roller Way and can be easily replaced without
any modification on the machine or equipment using the
existing Crossed Roller Way.

Special mounting screw 	B
The way on the preload adjustment side is moved when the preload is adjusted. There should be some
allowance for movement between the way fixing screw and the mounting hole. When such allowance
cannnot be provided or when the fixing screw is installed from the way side as shown in Fig. 2, it is
convenient to use the attached special mounting screws.
This special mounting screw is also available when the positinal accuracy of the mounting holes and
female screws of the machine on which the fixed side ways are mounted is not sufficient.

Basic dynamic load rating
C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as a constant load both in direction and magnitude under which a
group of identical Crossed Roller Way are individually operated and 90% of those in the group can travel
100 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
Basic static load rating
C 0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between a rolling element and raceways receiving the maximum load.
Allowable load
F
The allowable load is a load under which the sum of elastic deformations of the rolling element and the
raceways in the contact area subjected to the maximum contact stress is small enough to guarantee
accuracy and smooth rolling movement.
Therefore, where very smooth and highly accurate linear motion is required, make sure to use an Anti-Creep
Cage Crosse Roller Way well within the allowable load values.
For the load rating and allowable load of Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way, values for a downward load
provided when a combination of four ways and two roller cages is used in parallel are indicated. An outline
of them is described below.
The load ratings and allowable load of Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way are designed for equal load
capacity in downward, upward, and lateral directions.

Oil or grease is used as a lubricant for Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way. 	Oil is generally used for
high speed or low friction operation. On the other hand, grease is used when operating speed is low. In
case of grease lubrication, good quality lithium-soap base grease is recommended. 	When operation
speed is low and load is light, coat the raceways with grease before use and rubricate periodically.
Structure show in Fig.4 makes the lubrication easy.
Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way is finished in production very accurately. 	If harmful foreign
materials such as dust or chips enter inside the ways, this will shorten the life or lower the accuracy.
With the object of preventing external harmful foreign materials such as dust, chips and water from
entering inside, it is recommended to install a non-contact-type labyrinth seal shown in Fig. 5 or a
contact type wiper seal shown in Fig. 6 on both side faces.

Check whether the operating characteristics of the selected Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way are
suitable for the application of the machine or equipment.
Specifications of Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way	1
Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Ways are finished in production very accurately, so handle carefully.
A pinion is assembled in the roller cage. If the cage is dropped or handled roughly, the pinion may come
off. As cutting off the cage may cause the pinion coming off or damage to the pinion mounting part, so
please avoid cutting off the cage.
A rack is assembled in the way and fixed its position with the end screws. When assembling, the rack
may come out from the way by removing the end screws.
Handling of Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way	2
The general configuration of mating mounting surfaces for Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way is shown
Fig. 7.
Accuracy of the mating mounting surfaces are, in general, as shown in Table 3. 	The accuracy of the
mating mounting surfaces directly affects the operating accuracy and performance of Anti-Creep Cage
Crossed Roller Way. If very precise operating accuracy is required, higher accuracy of mating mounting
surfaces than the values shown in Table 3 may be needed.

Shape of the mounting part	4
Preload method	5
It is recommended to make a relieved fillet
at 	the 	corner 	of 	the 	mating 	mounting
surfaces as shown in Fig.8. 	Allow a
clearance of 0.5 mm or more between the
way and the mating material of the other
side.
Preload adjusting screws are generally
used for setting preload, as shown in Fig.9.
The size of the preload adjusting screws
are the same as that of the mounting
screws for the ways. 	The position of the
preload adjusting screws is at the same
position as the mounting screws of the
ways. For centering, use half of way height
H.
Preload amounts differ according to the
application 	of 	machine 	or 	equipment.
Excessive preloads deteriorate life and
often damage the raceways. 	Therefore,
zero or minimal preload is recommended in
general. 	If 	accuracy 	and 	rigidity 	are
important, a setting plate as shown in
Fig.10.1 or a tapered jib as shown in
Fig.10.2 may be used.

Tightening torque of mounting screws is shown in Table 4. If vibration or shock is large, or moment load
is applied, it is recommended to tighten the screws to about 1.3 times the values shown in Table 4. 	If
vibration and shock are not present and high operating accuracy is needed, a lower tightening torque
than the values shown in Table 4 is suggested. 	In this case, adhesive or lock-screws may be used to
prevent any subsequent loosening of the mounting screws.
Anti-Creep Cage Crossed Roller Way contains synthetic resin parts. 	Accordingly, the maximum
operating temperature is 120 C. 	In case of continuous operation, operating temperature should not
exceed 100 C.
The operating speed of Crossed Roller Way should not exceed 30m/min.

A general method of Anti-Cage Creep Crossed Roller Way is shown in Fig.11. The general procedure is as
follows.
CRWG 	is 	delivered 	as 	an 	individual
package containing four ways and two
roller cages. The ways in each package are
not interchangeable with ways in other
packages, so do not mix them.
Separate the end screws or end stoppers
and wash the ways with a clean cleaning
agent. After cleaning, apply rust preventing
oil or lubricating oil.
Remove 	burrs 	and 	blemishes 	from
mounting surfaces of table and bed with an
oil-stone, etc. During this process, also pay
attention to the corner grooves of the
mounting surfaces.
Wipe off dust with clean cloth and apply
rust preventive oil or lubricating oil.

Mounting of ways at bed side (Fig.13)	3
Mounting of ways at table side (Fig.14)	4
After fitting mounting surface of ways
onto the mating mounting surfaces of
bed, temporally tighten the mounting
screws with uniform tightening torque.
After closely fitting the ways to B surfaces
(See Fig.12), tighten mounting screws
uniformly to the prescribed tightening
torque.
If high accuracy is required, tighten the
mounting 	screws 	uniformly 	to 	the
prescribed 	tightening 	torque 	while
checking the parallelism of the two ways
along the overall way length.
General tightening torque of mounting
screws is shown in Table 4 on page E-57.
After fitting the mounting surfaces of the
way at the fixed side to the mating
mounting surfaces of table, temporally
tighten the mounting screws at the fixed
side with uniform tightening torque.
After closely fitting the way at the fixed
side to C surface, tighten the mounting
screws at the fixed side uniformly to the
prescribed tightening torque.
Loosen the preload adjusting screws and
temporally tighten the mounting screws of
the way at adjusting side with uniform
and light tightening torque.
Assembling of table and bed	5
Remove end screws from the way at table
side and way at the bed-side in the side
to which the cylindrical rollers with a
retainer are inserted. (See Fig.15.1)
Place the cylindrical rollers with a retainer
on the way at bed-side with the center of
the pinion gear in the center of the retainer
engaged with the end of the rack gear of
the way. 	(See Fig.15.2) 	Do not bend the
retainer.

Slide the table on the base. Do not apply
any offset load to the rack gear and the
pinion gear and do not deform the cage.
Check and make sure the rack gear is
over the end of the way. If the rack gear is
over the end of the way, gently push the
rack gear into the way while moving the
table at a little stroke. (See Fig.15.4)
Slide the table to the center of the stroke
and tighten the end screws.
(See Fig.15.5)
Gently move the table at a full stroke and
make sure that the cylindrical roller at
each end of the retainer does not hit the
end screw of the track base within the
stroke. If the roller hits the retainer end,
repeat the above steps from the first. (See
Fig.15.6)
After checking the stroke movement, adjust the preload, check the slide movement of the table and check
the accuracy. With this, the mounting procedure of the CRWG crossed roller way is completed.
Engage the end of the rack gear of the
way at table side with the pinion gear
while 	adjusting 	the 	longitudinal 	and
traverse positions of the way at table-side
and pushing the retainer to secure. Do
not give any excessive force to the cage.

Preload adjustment	6
Final fixing of the way at adjusting side	7
Final checking (Fig.17)	8
Preload adjustment is done only when
mounting screws for the way at the
adjusting side are temporally tightened.
Preload adjustment is started from the
adjusting screw at the center of the way
length, proceeding alternately to the left
and right.
While checking the clearance (deflection)
at the side surface of table, tighten each
amount, then repeat the same process
applying a higher tightening torque until a
dial gauge indicates zero-clearance. (No
more change in deflection) 	Record the
tightening torque of the adjusting screws
at zero-clearance.
When adjusting the screws close to the
end of the way, gradually stroke the table and ensure that the roller cage is positioned at the adjusting
screws.
Using the above process, the internal clearance becomes zero or minimal amount of preload, but the
preload amount is not uniform along the way length. Therefore, repeat the same process and tighten all
adjusting screws uniformly to the recorded tightening torque.
The mounting screws have been tightened lightly to a uniform torque. Similar to the adjustment of the
preload adjusting screws, temporally tighten the mounting screws at the adjusting side to a slightly lower
tightening torque than the prescribed value. Start from the center screw of the way length and proceed
alternately to the left and right.
When tightening the mounting screws close to the end of the way, gradually stroke the table and ensure
that the roller cage is positioned at the mounting screw.
Finally, tighten all mounting screws at the adjusting side uniformly to the prescribed torque similar to the
adjustment of the preload adjusting screws.
Stroke the table gradually till its full stroke
length, ensuring that the stroke is smooth
and quiet.
Check 	the 	operating 	accuracy 	by
measuring the upper and side faces of
table with a dial gauge.

High accuracy
A one-piece center way is mounted on a bed of simple
configuration which avoids any potential errors from
machining and assembled with side ways mounted on a
table, achieving linear motion of stable high accuracy.
A variety of available models and sizes
Crossed Roller Way Unit is available in three types. In
addition, many different sizes in each type are provided
to meet diverse dimensional requirements of machines
and equipment.
Easy mounting
Mounting surfaces of the table and bed are precisely
finished by grinding. Female threads in the table and
counterbored mounting holes in the bed are prepared
for easy assembling.
Crossed Roller Way Unit is delivered from the factory
with a finely adjusted preload in order to maintain high
operating accuracy, rigidity and long life.
Therefore, by assembling Crossed Roller Way Unit into
machines or equipment, a precise and durable linear
motion mechanism can be easily obtained.
High rigidity
Integrated design is applied to component parts as well
as the table and bed to provide maximum rigidity. The
assembled unit consequently demonstrates low elastic
deformation against loads in any direction and performs
with very high rigidity.

Crossed Roller Way Unit series
CRWU
CRWUR
CRWURS
This type is a general purpose
linear motion rolling guide
unit. 	The table and bed are
assembled with high accuracy
and can be readily mounted
onto machines or equipment
with bolts.
This type is a linear motion rolling
guide unit featuring a low sectional
height that is accomplished by simply
removing the bed from the CRWU.
Stable accuracy and high rigidity in
linear motion can be achieved against
loads in any direction.
This type is a compact linear
motion rolling guide unit featuring
a simple lightweight structure,
ideal for applications in which the
center way is stroked and high
accuracy with low inertia is
required.

The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which a
group of identical Crossed Roller Way Units are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group can
travel 100 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.
The allowable load is a load under which the sum of elastic deformations of the rolling element and the
raceway in the contact area subjected to the maximum contact stress is small enough to guarantee
accuracy and smooth rolling movement.
Therefore, when very smooth and highly accurate linear motion is required, make sure that the applied load
on Crossed Roller Way Unit is well within the allowable load value.
The static moment rating is defined as the static moment load that gives a prescribed constant contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum
load when a moment is loaded.
Summarized descriptions of load ratings of Crossed Roller Way Unit are given below. For details of load
rating definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
The load ratings for upward and lateral loads of Crossed Roller Way Unit are the same as those for
downward load.

The accuracy of Crossed Roller Way Unit is shown in Table 1.
Parallelism at table center shows the difference between the maximum and the minimum of table height when
the table is stroked.
Parallelism at table side shows the difference between the maximum and the minimum of measured values at
the table side (opposite to adjusting side) when the table is stroked.
The standard height tolerance of the unit is 	0.1 mm. If several units are used on the same mounting surface
and the height of those units require a limited height variation, units with a height variation of less than 0.01
mm among the several units to be used on the same mounting surface can be supplied on request.
If a special accuracy other than those shown in Table 1 is required, consult 	.
over 	incl.
Check whether the specifications of selected Crossed Roller Way Unit meet the requirements for the
application of the machine or equipment.
Crossed Roller Way Unit is a precision product, so handle it with care.
In Crossed Roller Way Unit, the cage can be shifted from the normal position under an uneven load or irregular
and high-speed motion. To correct the cage position, move the table in its full stroke after a certain operating
time or reciprocating cycles.
Crossed Roller Way Unit does not contain synthetic resin parts and can be operated at high temperatures.
But when the temperature exceeds 100 C, consult 	.

Tightening torque of mounting screws is
shown in Table 2. 	If vibration or shock is
large, or if a moment load is applied, it is
recommended to further tighten the screws
to 1.3 times the listed values.
In order to avoid interference of the table
with the mating mounting surface, carefully
check H1 and H dimensions shown in the
dimension tables and design the height of
the mating mounting surface accordingly.
Example of the mating mounting surface of
the bed is shown in Table 3.
In the center way of the CRWU 	R, dowel pin holes are prepared. When drilling a dowel pin hole in the bed, drill
the hole in the bed through the dowel pin hole in the center way after assembling the center way on the bed.
The diameters and tolerances of the center way hole are shown in the dimension tables.
Preloads of Crossed Roller Way Unit are adjusted to zero clearance or minimal preload at the factory. Crossed
Roller Way Unit does not usually require any further adjustment. If preload readjustment of the CRWU or CRWU 	R
is needed, adjust it according to "Preload adjustment" of the Crossed Roller Way shown on page E-23.
The operating speed of Crossed Roller Way Unit should not exceed 30 m/min.

BWU
High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU is a compact linear motion rolling guide for limited
stroke length. The unit incorporates two rows of steel balls in four point contact with the raceways
so that stable accuracy and high rigidity are obtained even under fluctuating and complex loads.
Wide variations in size are available for selections suitable for each application.
High accuracy and smooth movement
Two raceways on the solid table and on the solid bed
respectively are ground at one time to minimize
processing errors and improve accuracy between the
two raceways. High accuracy and smooth movement
are assured.
Stainless steel type
All components are made of stainless steel to give
superior corrosion and heat resistance. So this series is
most suitable for use in clean rooms.

Basic dynamic load rating
C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as
the constant load both in direction and
magnitude under which a group of identical
High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Units BWU
are individually operated and 90% of the units
in the group can travel 50x103 meters free
from material damage due to rolling contact
fatigue.
The load ratings of High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU are defined for downward load.
Summarized descriptions of load ratings are given below. For details of load rating definitions and load
calculations, see "General description".
C,C0
Fig. 1 Direction of load rating
Basic static load rating
C 0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.
Allowable load
F
Allowable load is the load under which the sum of elastic deformations of the rolling element and the
raceway in the contact area subjected to the maximum contact stress is small enough to guarantee
accuracy and smooth rolling movement.
Therefore, when very smooth and highly accurate linear motion is required, make sure that the applied load
is well within the allowable load value.
Static moment rating
T 0
The static moment rating is defined as the
static moment load that gives a prescribed
constant contact stress at the center of the
contact area between the rolling element and
raceway receiving the maximum load when a
moment is loaded.

Precautions for Use	Precautions for Use
High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU does not incorporate a mechanical stopper. When over
stroke is expected during the operation, prepare a stopper system on the adjoining equipment.
High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU is coated with rust preventive oil. Wash it with clean liquid
before assembling and lubricate it by coating with good quality oil or grease.
When high running accuracy is needed, the load should be applied at around the center of the table (or
bed) and avoid stroking the table in full length.
Use High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU at speeds lower than 30 m/min.
The tightening depth of screws on the table should be less than the values shown in the dimension table.
If the tightening depth is larger than these values, the screw will push the bed as the screw hole in the
table is a through hole and the running accuracy and life will deteriorate.

Sometimes, retainers may shift from the normal position due to unbalanced loading and/or irregular and
high speed operation. To remedy for such phenomena, move High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit
BWU in full stroke at some intervals during operation prescribed either in time or number of strokes.

High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU can be used at high temperatures, because it does not
have resin parts. However, if the operating temperature is over 100˚C, consult 	.
Preload of High Rigidity Precision Linear Slide Unit BWU is adjusted to a proper amount at 	factory.

BSPBSPG 	BSR
Precision Linear Slide is a light weight and compact linear motion rolling guide, comprising a U-
shaped table (or slide unit race) and bed (or track rail) made from stainless steel sheet by precision
forming. 	The raceway grooves are accurately ground on the table (or slide unit race) and bed (or
track rail). 	Precision Linear Slide features high performance and durability, making this series
suitable for measuring equipment, disk drives, IC manufacturing and inspection devices, etc.
Wide variations in performance and size are available for selections suitable for each application.
Superior corrosion resistance
The balls, table, bed and other steel components are
made of stainless steel. So this series is superior in
corrosion resistance and most suitable for use in clean
rooms.
Light weight and compact
A simple structural design minimizes the number of
components, offering reduced size and weight of sliding
members in machines and equipment.
Stable performance
The steel balls are arranged in two rows with each ball
contacting the raceways at four points. So stable load
capacity is assured for loads in all directions. 	In
addition, the simple design minimizes errors in
manufacturing and assembly, ensuring high operating
accuracy.
Quiet and smooth motion
The advanced design of ball retainers and circulators
combined with precise grinding of raceways minimizes
noise and gives smooth motion with low frictional
resistance. 	So superior positioning accuracy and
response can be obtained during operation even for a
very small feed motion.
High safety
All organic components are made of nonflammable or
self-extinguishing materials. So this series may be used
in home appliances and office equipment.

Limited linear motion type
A special synthetic resin
retainer is used to hold the
balls 	and 	eliminate 	ball
contact noise caused by
balls colliding with each
other. 	Extremely smooth
and light movement without
stick slip is obtained in a
limited stroke length.
Built-in rack & pinion type
The one-piece retainer in this type
holds the balls in both rows. A
pinion gear assembled in the retainer
engages with racks fixed on the table
and bed to prevent drifting
movement of the retainer in relation
to the table and bed. The BSPG type
has the same extremely smooth
movement as the BSP type.
Endless linear motion type
This type features a special
synthetic resin circulator to
recirculate the balls, permitting
longer stroke lengths with low
noise.

Table 3 Accuracy of BSP type and BSPG type
Summarized descriptions of load ratings of Precision Linear Slide are given below. For details of load rating
definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which
a group of identical Precision Linear Slides are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group can
travel 50 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.
The accuracy of Precision Linear Slide in operation is shown in Tables 3 and 4.

Precautions for Use	Precautions for Use
To obtain consistently high accuracy in operation, the applied load should not exceed 20% of the basic
static load rating.
1
To maximize the accuracy of BSP or BSPG type, center the applied load over the table or bed. Allow
enough additional stroke length to avoid reaching the maximum stroke length.
2
Unevenly applied loads and high fluctuating velocities may dislocate the position of the ball retainer in
the BSP type. Therefore, it is recommended that the retainer is periodically repositioned to its proper
location by cycling the BSP type over its full stroke length.
3
BSPG or BSR type is recommended when it is difficult to readjust the position of the retainer in the BSP type.	4
Use Precision Linear Slide at speeds lower than 30 m/min.	6
Precision Linear Slide does not incorporate a mechanical stopper. When over stroke is expected during
the operation, prepare a stopper mechanism on the adjoining equipment.
7
In order to ensure smooth motion of BSP and BSR types, it is recommended to wash out rust preventive
oil with a suitable cleaning agent, and reapply a high grade lubricating oil or grease to the raceways
before running in.
8
The raceways and gear mechanism of BSPG type is smeared with Perfluoro Polyether grease, containing
a volatile corrosion inhibiting film. 	In general use, the BSPG type can be used without any additional
treatment if it is kept clean.
9
Operating temperature
The maximum operating temperature is 120˚C, and continuous operation is possible at temperatures up
to 100˚C. If the operating temperature exceeds 100˚C, consult 	for further information.

Precautions for Mounting	Precautions for Mounting
When mounting Precision Linear Slide, the mounting bolts should not be inserted deeper than the
maximum insertion depth shown in the dimension table.
When mounting the BSP and BSPG types, the female threads in the table and bed are usually used. It can
also be mounted with screws that are one size smaller than the female threads by inserting the screws through
the female thread holes. BSP 715 SL 	BSP 740 SL can not be mounted from inside of the table and bed.
The reference mounting surface of Precision Linear Slide is the side surface opposite to the 	mark.	1

4
The accuracy of mating surface affects both accuracy and performance of Precision Linear Slides.
Therefore, to obtain optimal accuracy during operation, the surface should be finished to as high
accuracy as possible.
It is recommended to make a relieved fillet at the corner of the mating reference mounting surfaces as
shown in Fig. 1. 	However, corner radius R1 shown in Table 5 can also be used. 	Table 5 shows
recommended shoulder height of the mating reference mounting surfaces.

When mounting the track rail of BSR type, the female threads of the track rail are used. It can also be
mounted with screws that are one size smaller than the female threads by inserting the screws through
the female thread holes. BSR 1530 SL and BSR 2040 SL can not be mounted from inside of the track rail.
When mounting BSR1230SL to BSR1260SL track rail with screws that are one size smaller than the
female threads by inserting the screws through the female thread holes, consult 	.

Tightening torque of mounting bolts affects the performance and accuracy of Precision Linear Slides.
The limit of the tightening torque depends on the material, rigidity and finish of the mating surfaces. In
general, a light tightening torque is used and the recommended values are shown in Table 6. 	When
vibration is expected to occur, it is recommended to use adhesive agent, etc. to secure the bolts.

Linear Bushing G is a high load capacity type linear motion rolling guide which achieves endless
linear motion of an external cylinder along a shaft with grooved raceways. 	It is a very simple and
compact linear bushing with a large load capacity.
Interchangeable
The dimensional accuracy of the external cylinder and
that of the shaft with grooved raceways are controlled
individually to ensure interchangeability, so that they
can be combined, added or exchanged freely.
Solid shaft and hollow shaft
The shaft with grooved raceways can be selected from
two types: the solid shaft type LMG and the hollow
shaft type LMGT. The hollow shaft type is suitable for
applications in which piping, wiring or ventilation is
needed.
Dimensionally interchangeable with Linear Bushing LM
Linear Bushing G is dimensionally interchangeable with
Linear Bushing LM and it is easy to change from one to
another.
High load capacity
Two rows of steel balls are incorporated in the external
cylinder and make contact with grooved raceways of
the shaft to obtain high rigidity and high load capacity.

Load Rating	Load Rating
The load ratings of Linear Bushing G are defined for downward load. 	Summarized descriptions of load
ratings are given below. 	For details of load rating definitions and load calculations, see "General
description".
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which
a group of identical Linear Bushings G are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group can travel
50 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.

T
The static torque rating is defined as the static
torque that gives a prescribed constant contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the
rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum
load.
Static torque rating
T 0
Since the load ratings of Linear Bushing G given in
the table of dimensions are for downward load, they
must be corrected for the load direction for upward
or lateral load. 	The corrected basic dynamic load

Both grease and oil lubrication are applicable. In case of grease lubrication, use of quality lithium-soap base
grease is recommended for general applications.
The radial internal clearance of Linear Bushing G is approx. 10m. In the shell flange type, radial internal
clearance is slightly smaller than that of standard type.
Lubrication	1
The fixing depth of mounting bolt of external cylinder should be less than the maximum depth shown in the
dimension table. The fixing female thread hole in the external cylinder is a through hole. Therefore, if the
fixing depth of mounting bolt is too large, the mounting bolt will contact and push the shaft, and accuracy
and life will be affected adversely.

The normal fit between the external cylinder of Linear Bushing G and the housing is recommended to be a
clearance fit (H7). But, in special cases, a transition fit (J7) may be used.
In case of the external cylinder with shell type flange, a clearance of over 0.2 mm based on the nominal
outside diameter is required.
Support blocks are prepared for supporting the ends of "shaft with grooved raceways" of Linear Bushing G.
For details, consult 	.

Linear Bushing is a high precision linear motion rolling guide which travels along a shaft to
achieve endless linear motion. 	In the external cylinder, a retainer, steel balls, etc. are compactly
incorporated. Wide variations in size are available for selections suitable for each application.
Low frictional linear motion
Steel balls are accurately guided by a retainer, so low
frictional resistance and stable linear motion can be
achieved.
Wide variations
For each dimensional series, standard, adjustable
clearance and open types are available with and without
seals, so the best linear bushing for the application may
be selected.
Stainless steel type
Linear Bushings made of stainless steel are also
available. This type is suitable for applications where
corrosion resistance is important.
Simple replacement of conventional plain bushings
It is easy to use Linear Bushings instead of conventional
plain bushings, because both types are used with a
round shaft, and no major redesign is necessary.

Standard type
This type is widely used as a general purpose linear

Open type
This type has one or two fewer ball circuits than the
standard type, creating an open section to allow
clearance for a shaft support.
The open type bushing is commonly used with long
shafts when one or more support blocks are needed
to reduce shaft deflection or sag. The width of the
support blocks can be determined to match the (E)
dimension of fan shaped open section shown in the
table of dimensions. The radial internal clearance can
also be adjusted.
Adjustable clearance type
A slot in a longitudinal direction is made on the
external cylinder in order to adjust the clearance.
When this type is used with a housing which can
adjust the bore diameter, the radial internal clearance
can be adjusted without fit selection between the
linear bushing and shaft. It is possible to give a
preload.

Load Rating	Load Rating
Summarized descriptions of load ratings of Linear Bushing are given below. 	For details of load rating
definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which
a group of identical Linear Bushings are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group can travel
50 x 103 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.
Fig. 1 Load direction A 	Fig. 2 Load direction B
Basic dynamic load rating
C
Basic static load rating
C 0
Load ratings of Linear Bushing are affected by the position of the ball circuits. In the table of dimensions,
two types of load ratings are shown corresponding to the load directions and steel ball circuit positions as
shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
In Fig. 1 the load direction is in line with the steel ball circuit position and this direction is referred to as load
direction A in the table of dimensions. In general, the load ratings for this direction are also used, when the
load direction is indeterminate or the steel ball circuit position in relation to the load direction cannot be
determined.
In Fig. 2, the load direction is pointed at the center of two ball circuits and this direction is referred to as load
direction B in the table of dimensions. In general, a larger load can be received in this case compared with
load direction A.

Precautions for Use	Precautions for Use
Table 1 Surface hardness and roughness of raceway
Adjustable clearance and open type Linear Bushings can be adjusted for radial internal clearance if they are
used with a housing which can adjust the bore diameter.
However, if the degree of the adjustment is excessive, deformation at the contact points between steel balls
and shaft or external cylinder becomes large, resulting in short life. Therefore, it is recommended to prepare
a shaft with a specified fit tolerance and adjust the radial internal clearance to zero or minimal preload by
matching the individual components.
The clearance is adjusted while checking with a dial gage. The adjustment is generally completed when the
shaft is rotated in an unloaded condition and light resistance is caused by the rotation of shaft. 	In this
condition, the radial internal clearance becomes zero or minimal preload. 	For open type Linear Bushings
having three rows of ball circuits, clearance adjustment can not be made.
Since Linear Bushings operate with a shaft as a raceway surface, the shaft should be heat-treated and
ground. 	Recommended surface hardness and roughness of the shaft are shown in Table 1, and also
recommended minimum effective hardening depth of the raceway is shown in Table 2.

adequate.

Open type Linear Bushings having three rows of ball circuits can be used only for the load direction shown
in Fig. 5. If two Linear Bushings are used in parallel, by considering the load distribution, the arrangement
shown in Fig. 6 is recommended.
This type can not be adjusted for radial internal clearance.
Precaution for use of Open type Linear Bushing having three rows of ball circuits	5
Linear Bushings can only be operated in linear motion and can not be rotated. When linear motion in short
stroke length and rotation are both required, 0000 Stroke Rotary Bushing (See page E-176.) is
recommended. If linear motion in long stroke length and rotation are both required, a combination of
Linear Bushing
and 	Needle Roller Bearing as shown in Fig. 4 is recommended.

Table 3 shows the recommended fit tolerances for Linear Bushing. 	The fit between Linear Bushing and
housing is usually clearance fit. For some special applications, an interference fit may be required.
For adjustable clearance or open type Linear Bushings, the following recommendations apply. 	The shaft
diameter is finished smaller than the lower limit of the tolerance range of the inscribed circle diameter of the
Linear Bushing, while the housing diameter is finished larger than the upper limit of the tolerance range of
the outside diameter of the external cylinder of the Linear Bushing.

Fit
When press-fitting the Linear Bushing into the housing, do not hit the
end plate. The correct method is to gradually push the external cylinder
with a jig for assembling. (See Fig. 7.) 	Then the external cylinder is
fixed in the axial direction with a stop ring or a stopper plate. 	When
inserting the shaft into the Linear Bushing assembled into a housing,
gradually and gently insert a shaft avoiding to give impact on the steel
balls and retainers.
If two shafts are used in parallel, fix one shaft accurately as a datum
shaft and locate the second shaft to the datum shaft keeping the
parallelism. Fig. 8 shows an example of general assembling.

Stainless Steel Linear Bushing with Seals : Metric series

-- 520 of 706 --

E-166
LMS
Miniature Linear Bushing is a miniature type linear motion rolling guide which travels along a
shaft to achieve endless linear motion. 	The shaft diameter is 35 mm. 	In the external cylinder of
Miniature Linear Bushing, a retainer, steel balls and stop rings are compactly incorporated, and
precise positioning accuracy can be obtained.
Low frictional linear motion
Steel balls are accurately guided by a retainer, so low
frictional resistance and stable linear motion can be
achieved.
Wide variations
In addition to the standard type, the high-rigidity long
type is available. These types can be selected to suit
the requirements in applications.
Stainless steel type
Miniature Linear Bushings made of stainless steel are
also available. 	This type is suitable for applications
where corrosion resistance is important.
Compact design
Miniature Linear Bushing is very small in size, allowing
for compact assembly in machines and equipment.

Load Rating	Load Rating
Summarized descriptions of load ratings of Miniature Linear Bushing are given below. 	For details of load
rating definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant load both in direction and magnitude under which
a group of identical Miniature Linear Bushings are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group
can travel 50 x 10 3 meters free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
The basic static load rating is defined as the static load that gives a prescribed constant contact stress at
the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum load.

Basic dynamic load rating
C
Basic static load rating
C 0
Load ratings of Miniature Linear Bushing are affected by the position of the ball circuits. 	In the table of
dimensions, two types of load ratings are shown corresponding to the load directions and steel ball circuit
positions as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
In Fig. 1 the load direction is in line with the steel ball circuit position and this direction is referred to as load
direction A in the table of dimensions. In general, the load ratings for this direction are also used, when the load
direction is indeterminate or the steel ball circuit position in relation to the load direction cannot be determined.
In Fig. 2, the load direction is pointed at the center of two ball circuits and this direction is referred to as load
direction B in the table of dimensions. In general, a larger load can be received in this case compared with load
direction A.

Remark
Since Miniature Linear Bushings operate with a shaft as a raceway surface, the shaft should be heat-treated
and ground. Recommended surface hardness, roughness and minimum effective hardening depth of the shaft
are shown in Table 1.
Raceway surface	1
Miniature Linear Bushing can be used with oil or grease lubrication. It is a common practice to apply grease
lightly on the shaft surface and steel balls for grease lubrication. A good quality lithium-soap base grease is
recommended for grease lubrication.
Lubrication	2
Miniature Linear Bushing can only be operated in linear motion and can not be rotated. When linear motion in
short stroke length and rotation are both required, 	Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing (See page E-186.)
is recommended.
When rotational motion is present	3
When Miniature Linear Bushing is assembled with the shaft, do not insert the shaft with angle. It is possible
that the steel balls will fall out or the retainer will be deformed and smooth operation can not be obtained.
Insertion of shaft	4
When the raceway hardness is less than the
necessary hardness, multiply load ratings by
the hardness factor.

Table 2 shows the recommended fit tolerances for Miniature Linear Bushing.
Thickness of external cylinder is very thin. Therefore, when fitting it into the housing, epoxy type adhesive is
recommended for fixing the external cylinder in the housing. Do not apply press fitting.
In order to achieve full performance of Miniature Linear Bushing, heat-treated and ground steel shafts with
high accuracy and rigidity are available. For details, consult 	.

Stroke Rotary Bushing is a compact linear motion rolling guide capable of rotation as well as
linear motion with low frictional resistance. 	In the external cylinder, steel balls and a retainer are
incorporated. Standard and sealed types are available. In both standard and sealed types, ordinary
and heavy duty types are available. This series is used in many applications.
Rotary and linear motion
Steel balls and a retainer are incorporated in an external
cylinder having a cylindrical raceway on the inside, so
rotary motion can be achieved as well as linear
movement.
Standard type Stroke Rotary Bushing
This type is classified into ordinary and heavy duty
types depending on the magnitude of load rating. The
heavy duty type has a larger load rating and a higher
rigidity than the ordinary type, but the stroke length is
shorter compared to the ordinary type.
Sealed type Stroke Rotary Bushing
In this type, synthetic resin seals are incorporated in the
external cylinder bore at both ends. These seals are
used to prevent intrusion of foreign substances. This
type is classified into ordinary and heavy duty types.
Both types have shorter stroke lengths compared to the
standard type.
Low frictional resistance
Very accurate steel balls are incorporated in a precisely
ground external cylinder. 	So low rolling friction with
extremely smooth rotary and reciprocating linear
motions can be obtained.

Structure of Stroke Rotary Bushing
Small inertia
Since the retainer is highly rigid but light, this series is
suitable for high speed rotation and reciprocating
movement as inertia is small.

are given below. For details of load rating definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
Basic dynamic load rating
C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant radial load both in direction and magnitude under
which a group of identical Stroke Rotary Bushings are individually operated and 90% of the units in the
group can rotate 1,000,000 revolutions free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
Basic static load rating
C 0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static radial load that gives a prescribed constant contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum
load.

Accuracy	Accuracy
The accuracy of Stroke Rotary Bushing is shown in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.
The outside diameter of external cylinder changes by the tension of the stop ring to be set with the external
cylinder. Accordingly, the measurement of the outside diameter should be made at the measuring position
obtained from formula (1), and the mean diameter at that position is used.

Allowable Limit of Speed	Allowable Limit of Speed
Stroke Rotary Bushing can operate in both linear and rotary directions at the same time. The allowable limit
of speed when linear motion and rotation occur at the same time can be obtained from the following
formula. Limiting values in general are shown in Table 4.
where, 	DN: Limit of speed (See Table 4.)
n: Number of revolutions per
minute, rpm
n1 : Number of strokes per minute, cpm
S: Stroke length, mm
Dpw : Pitch circle diameter of balls, mm (Dpw1.15 F 	w )

Table 4 Limit of speed
The fit of Stroke Rotary Bushing with shaft and housing bore is recommended to be as shown in Table 2.
Since both rotary and linear motions may be performed at the same time, radial clearance should be held to
minimum if shock load is applied or vibration is present during the operation. For use on a vertical axis or
when very accurate movement is required, zero clearance or minimal preload is recommended.
However, since excessive preload shortens life, radial clearance smaller than the values shown in Table 3
should not be used.

Precautions for Mounting	Precautions for Mounting
First, assemble Stroke Rotary Bushing into a housing. Then gradually and gently insert a shaft into a bore.
At this time, be careful not to give impact on the steel balls. After Stroke Rotary Bushing is assembled with
a shaft and housing, the retainer must be located at the center of the axial direction of the external cylinder.
In this process, insert the shaft into the bore, and the retainer will move together with the shaft and then
stop at the end of external cylinder. Push in the shaft further for the distance of 1/2 of the maximum stroke
length shown in the dimension tables while paying attention not to damage the steel balls and raceways.
Pull back the shaft for the distance of 1/2 of the maximum stroke length. 	The retainer should then be
positioned at the center of the axial direction of the external cylinder.

Remarks	Item 	Recommended value

Table 5 Surface hardness and roughness of raceways
Actual stroke length should be less than 80% of the maximum stroke length shown in the dimension tables.
Since Stroke Rotary Bushings operate with a shaft as a raceway surface, the shaft should be heat-treated
and ground. Recommended surface hardness and roughness of the shaft are shown in Table 5, and also
recommended minimum effective hardening depth of the raceway is shown in Table 6.
This series can be used with oil or grease lubrication. 	A good quality lithium-soap base grease is
recommended for grease lubrication. Lubrication is done through oil holes provided on the external cylinder.

When the required accuracy is not
severe, a surface roughness of about
0.8 mRa (3.2 mRy) is adequate.

Sealed type Stroke Rotary Bushing

-- 538 of 706 --

E-186
Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing is a very compact linear motion rolling guide with
small diameter and low sectional height. 	It is able to achieve both rotary and linear motion at the
same time.
Since Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing is extremely small in size and features high accuracy and low
frictional resistance, it is suitable for applications which require compact size with high accuracy
such as measuring instruments, IC manufacturing machines and precision equipment.
Rotary and linear motion
Steel balls held in a retainer are assembled into an outer
ring having a cylindrical raceway on the inside, so linear
motion as well as rotary movement can be achieved.
Extremely compact size
Very small diameter steel balls are assembled in a very
thin walled outer ring. 	So the assembled set is
extremely compact in sectional height.
Very smooth movement
All parts are precisely finished and assembled to obtain
an optimal preload. This series offers very smooth and
stable movement as well as high accuracy with low
frictional resistance.
Extremely accurate
The outer ring and shaft are precisely super-finished
after heat treatment. 	The assembled set, which
consists of an outer ring, shaft and very precise steel
balls held in a retainer, is set to zero or minimal preload.
So extremely accurate operation can be achieved both
in rotary and linear motion.

Fit	Fit
Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing is set to minimal preload condition to obtain high operating accuracy. For
Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing with shaft, a slight clearance fit between the outer ring and the housing is
recommended to avoid any undesirable influence on the inscribed circle diameter.
Also, when assembling the outer ring, ball cage and shaft, select the outer ring and shaft which have the
same selection code and match them to a ball cage.
Precautions for Use	Precautions for Use
The outer ring should have a clearance fit in the housing. When the outer ring must be positioned in the
axial direction with the housing, use a stop ring, etc. at the end of the outer ring or use synthetic
adhesive.
1
When inserting a shaft into a ball cage, the ball cage must be located at the center of the axial direction of
the outer ring. A convenient way of locating the ball cage is to shift the position of the ball cage prior to
assembly to the inserting direction for the distance of 1/2 of the inserting distance of the shaft.
2
When inserting the shaft into a ball cage, be careful not to damage the steel balls and raceways by
twisting the shaft or applying a shock load.
3
Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing can be used with oil or grease lubrication. When lubricating with grease,
the grease is usually lightly smeared on the raceways of the shaft and outer ring. A good quality lithium-
soap base grease is recommended.

Shaft	Basic static
load rating( 1 )
Miniature Stroke Rotary Bushing

-- 545 of 706 --

E-194
Stroke Rotary Cage is a compact linear motion rolling guide with low sectional height.
Steel balls having very small size variation in diameter are held in a retainer. 	Thus if they are
assembled with a shaft and housing which are precisely finished to function as raceways, reciprocal
linear motion as well as rotation can be achieved with high accuracy corresponding to the accuracy
of the shaft and housing.
Superior high speed performance
The retainers are highly rigid and light in weight with low
inertia. So this series is suitable for high speed
reciprocating linear motion.
Long life
The steel balls held in the retainer are arranged in a
spiral formation in order to prevent the steel balls
tracing the same path. Rolling contact fatigue of the
shaft and housing raceways is thereby minimized. Also,
stable high accuracy can be assured for long periods of
time.	Large load rating and high rigidity
In the retainer, steel balls are incorporated as many as
possible. So the load ratings are large and the rigidity is
high with small elastic deformation even under
fluctuating loads or localized edge loads.

Basic dynamic load rating
C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant radial load both in direction and magnitude under
which a group of identical Stroke Rotary Cages are individually operated and 90% of the units in the group
can rotate 1,000,000 revolutions free from material damage due to rolling contact fatigue.
Load Rating	Load Rating
The load ratings of Stroke Rotary Cage are defined for radial load. Summarized descriptions of load ratings
are given below. For details of load rating definitions and load calculations, see "General description".
Basic static load rating
C 0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static radial load that gives a prescribed constant contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum
load.
Fit	Fit
Stroke Rotary Cage is generally used with a minimal radial clearance. 	Recommended fits are shown in
Table 1.
If Stroke Rotary Cage is used on the die-set guiding posts of press machines or on machines which require
accurate operation, a preload is generally given. 	In this case, the dimensional accuracy of the shaft and
housing bore is recommended as shown in Table 2. However, since excessive preload shortens the life of
Stroke Rotary Cage, it is suggested that the lower limit of radial clearance is not smaller than the value
shown in Table 3.

First, assemble Stroke Rotary Cage into a housing. Then gradually and gently insert a shaft into a bore.
During assembly, keep the shaft parallel to the axis of Stroke Rotary Cage and avoid giving impact on the
steel balls.

When Stroke Rotary Cage is used in a preloaded condition, position the ball cage at the regular position
in the axial direction. A convenient way for positioning is to shift the position of the ball cage prior to the
assembly to the inserting direction for the distance of 1/2 of the inserting distance of the shaft.

Structure of Roller Way
Roller Way is a precision linear motion rolling guide incorporating cylindrical rollers with a
precisely finished race plate. It has high load capacity and high rigidity. Elastic deformation under
heavy or fluctuating load is very small and smooth linear motion can be easily obtained.
High rigidity and dimensional accuracy
Precise cylindrical rollers are matched with a solid
ground race plate finished to a high degree of flatness,
achieving both high rigidity and high dimensional
accuracy. As the height of Roller Way can be selected
within a narrow range of 2 m in dimensional tolerance,
uniform load distribution can be easily obtained among
multiple Roller Ways.
Smooth operation
Each type has a structure for accurate roller guidance
that prevents skewing. 	So very stable and smooth
linear motion is achieved.

When Roller Way SR or GSN is mounted on a
grooved mating mounting surface, the depth E of the
groove should be deeper than the dimension from
the lower surface of race plate to the bottom surface
of Roller Way SR or GSN, making a room for the
purpose of oil bath. (See Fig. 3.)
In addition to the above, for SR type, clearance fit or
similar clearance between the groove width W and
the width of SR type W1 is recommended. Then, the
relative positions of the groove and the reference
surface should be examined so that the center of W1
dimension should be positioned around the center of
the groove.

Flat Roller Cage is a precision linear motion rolling guide consisting of a high accuracy cage and
very precise rollers and features very low sectional height. 	In this series, both single row type and
double row type with a 90˚ angle are available. The cage material is steel or synthetic resin.
Smooth operation
As the cage precisely guides the rollers, the frictional
resistance is very low without stick-slip, and stable
linear motion is obtained.
Low noise
Cages made of synthetic resin are also available. This
type is most suitable for applications where low noise is
required.
Easy handling
The rollers are retained in a cage securely, allowing
easy handling and assembly.
Large load rating
Needle rollers are assembled in a cage with a small
pitch distance, so load ratings are large.
Cage 	Roller 	Cage 	Roller
FT 	FTW 	A
Adaptability to conventional plain guide ways
Single row and double row types are standardized and
can be easily used to modify the conventional plain
guide ways of machine tools, etc. into rolling guide type
without large-scale redesign of the bed.

Cam Followers are bearings with a stud incor-
porating needle rollers in a thick walled outer ring.
These bearings are designed for outer ring rotation,
and have superior rotational 	performance with a
small coefficient of friction and high load capacity.
As studs already have threads or steps, they are easy
to mount.
Cam Followers are follower bearings for cam mecha-
nisms and linear motions and have high rigidity and

Standard Type Cam Followers
These are the basic type bearings in 	Cam
Follower series. Models with stud diameters ranging
from 3 to 30 mm are prepared, and are suitable for a
wide range of applications.
Solid Eccentric Stud Type Cam Followers
The stud of these bearings is eccentric to the center
axis of the outer ring. Thus, the position of the outer
ring in the radial direction in relation to the mating
track surface can easily be adjusted by turning the
stud, and the load distribution on a number of 	cam
follower outer rings used on the same track surface
can be made uniform.
These are eccentric cam followers with a one-piece
stud that can be mounted in the same mounting holes
as those for Standard Type Cam Followers.
Eccentricity is 0.25 mm0.6 mm.
Eccentric Type Cam Followers
In these bearings, an eccentric collar is assembled
with the Cam Follower stud, enabling the outer ring to
be positioned easily in the radial direction against the
mating track surface.
Eccentricity is 0.41.5 mm.
Thrust Disk Type Cam Followers
These bearings have special resin thrust disk wash-
ers superior in wear and heat resistance between the
sliding surfaces of outer ring shoulders, stud head
and side plate. 	These disk washers reduce friction
and wear due to axial loads caused by misalignment,
etc.
Centralized Lubrication Type Cam Followers
These bearings have one or two pipe-threaded holes
in the stud. Thus, this series is suitable when central-
ized lubrication is required.
Easy Mounting Type Cam Followers
These bearings have a stepped tapered portion on
the stud. When mounting the Cam Follower, it is easy
to fix its location by tightening a set screw to the
stepped portion. 	Thus, this type is suitable when a
large number of Cam Followers are used in a
machine such as a pallet changer.
Capilube Cam Follower
These bearings are lubricated with a newly developed
thermosetting solid-type lubricant which fills the inner
space of the bearing. 	This lubricant provides long-
term maintenance free.
Heavy Duty Type Cam Followers
These bearings are full complement type bearings
incorporating double rows of full complement cylindri-
cal rollers in the outer ring, and can withstand large
radial loads and some axial loads.
Miniature Type Cam Followers
These are compactly designed bearings, incorporat-
ing very thin needle rollers in an outer ring with a
small outside diameter. 	They are used in electronic
devices, OA equipment, small index devices, etc.
Inch series Cam Followers
Two types, CR and CRH, are available in the 	Inch
series Cam Followers. 	Black oxide film treatment is
made on CRH models.

Roller guide method
Cam Followers include the caged type and the full
complement type . The caged type has a small coeffi-
cient of friction and is suitable for high speed rota-
tions, while the full complement type is suitable for
heavy loads at low speed rotations.
Seal structure
Cam Followers include the shield type and the sealed
type. 	In the shield type, the narrow clearances
between the outer ring and the stud flange and
between the outer ring and the side plate form
labyrinths .
The sealed type incorporates seals in the narrow
clearances to prevent the penetration of foreign parti-
cles.
Shape of outer ring outside surface
The outside surface of the outer ring of Cam
Followers, which makes direct contact with the mat-
ing track surface, is either crowned or cylindrical. The
crowned outer rings 	are effective in moderating the
edge load due to mounting errors. 	The cylindrical
outer rings have a large contact area with the mating
track surface, and are suitable for applications in
which the applied load is large or the track surface
hardness is low.
Shape of stud head
Cam Followers are available in two stud head shape
types, namely, the type with screwdriver slot and the
type with hexagon hole for hexagon bar wrench.
Various types are lined up in Cam Follower series,
including the caged type, full complement type, shield
type, sealed type, type with crowned outer ring, type
with cylindrical outer ring, type with hexagonal hole,
etc.

Fit
Tables 5 and 6 show recommended tolerances of
mounting holes for Cam Follower studs. 	Since the
Cam Follower is supported in a cantilever position,
the mounting hole diameter should be prepared with-
out play between the stud and the hole especially
when heavy shock loads are applied.

Maximum Allowable Static Load
The applicable load on Cam Followers is, in some
cases, limited by the bending strength and shear
strength of the stud and the strength of the outer ring
instead of the load rating of the needle roller bearing.
Therefore, the maximum allowable static load that is
lmited by these strengths is specified.
Track Capacity
Track capacity is defined as a load which can be con-
tinuously applied on a Cam Follower placed on a steel
track surface without causing any deformation or
indentation on the track surface when the outer ring of

unit: N
the Cam Follower makes contact with the mating
track surface (plane). The track capacities shown in
Tables 7.1 and 7.2 are applicable when the hardness
of the mating track surface is 40HRC (Tensile
strength 1250N/mm 2
). When the hardness of the mat-
ing track surface differs from 40HRC, the track capac-
ity is obtained by multiplying the value by the track
capacity factor shown in Table 8.
If lubrication between the outer ring and the mating
track surface is insufficient, seizure and/or wear may
occur depending on the application. Therefore, atten-
tion must be paid to lubrication and surface rough-
ness of the mating track especially for high-speed
rotations such as cam mechanisms.

Lubrication
Grease-prepacked Cam Followers are shown in Table
10. The lubricating grease prepacked in these bear-
ings is ALVANIA GREASE S2 (SHELL).
For Cam Followers without prepacked grease, grease
should be packed through the oil hole in the stud for
use. If they are used without lubricant, wear of rolling
contact surfaces may take place, leading to a short
bearing life.

Allowable Rotational Speed
The allowable rotational speed of Cam Followers is
affected by mounting and operating conditions. 	For
reference, Table 9 shows d1n values when only pure
radial loads are applied. Cosidering that axial loads
also act under actual operating conditions, the recom-
mended d1n value is 1/10 of the value shown in the
table.

Notes 1 	In case of Eccentric Type Cam Followers (CFE), thread diameter G shown in the table of dimensions is applicable in place of stud
dia. and the oil hole on the outer surface of the stud cannot be used for lubrication.
2 	The stud head and stud end are provided with a tapped hole for piping.
3 	For the models CF510-1B(UU,R), oil hole is provided in the resin made re-greasing plug which is inserted into the hexagon hole.
To re-lubricate through this oil hole, a sharp grease gun nozzle is required.
Oil hole is prepared.
Oil Hole
The position of oil hole is shown in Table 11. 	Re-
greasing cannot be made for models without a oil
hole.

Operating Temperature Range
The operating temperature range for 	Cam
Followers is -20 C+120 	C. However, the maximum
allowable temperature for the following types is differ-
ent.
The maximum allowable temperature for the Metric
CF series with a stud diameter d1 of 4 mm or less,
Stainless steel made Cam Followers with a stud
diameter 5mm or less and CFS2 is +110 C, and +100
C when they are continuously operated.
The maximum allowable temperature for the sealed
type with a stud diameter d1 of 5 mm or less is +80 C.
The maximum allowable temperature for Capilube
Cam Follower is -15 C+80 	C.
Mounting
1 Make the center axis of the mounting hole perpen-
dicular to the moving direction of the Cam Follower
and match the side shoulder accurately with the
seating surface indicated by dimension f in the
table of dimensions. 	(See Fig. 1.) 	Then, fix the
Cam Follower with the nut. 	Do not hit the flange
head of the Cam Follower directly with a hammer,
etc. 	This may lead to a bearing failure such as
irregular rotation or cracking.
2 The 	mark on the flange head of the stud indi-
cates the position of the oil hole on the raceway.
Avoid locating the oil hole within the loading zone.
This may lead to a short bearing life. (See Fig. 2.)
The hole located in the middle part of the stud per-
pendicular to the stud center axis is used for greas-
ing or locking.
3 When tightening the nut, the tightening torque
should not exceed the values shown in the table of
dimensions . If the tightening torque is too large, it
is possible that the threaded portion of the stud will
be broken. When there is a possibility of loosening,
a special nut such as a lock nut, spring washer, or
self-locking nut should be used.
Fig. 1 Seating surface
Fig. 2 Oil hole position and loading direction
Fig. 3 Mounting example of Solid Eccentric Stud Type Cam Follower
4 In the case of Solid Eccentric Stud Type Cam
Followers and Eccentric Type Cam Followers, the
outer ring position can be adjusted appropriately by
turning the stud with a screwdriver or hexagon bar
wrench using the screwdriver slot or hexagon hole
of the stud head. The stud is fixed with a nut and a
spring washer, etc. 	The tightening torque should
not exceed the values of maximum tightening
torque shown in the table of dimensions.
When shock loads are applied and the adjusted
eccentricity has to be ensured, it is recommended
to make holes in the housing, stud and eccentric
collar, and fix the stud with a dowel pin as shown in
Fig. 3. 	However, when the stud diameter is less
than 8 mm (Eccentric collar diameter 11 mm), it is
difficult to make a hole in the stud because the stud
is through-hardened.

Caution in Use
1 Never wash Capilube Bearing with organic solvent
and/or white kerosene which have the ability to
remove fat, or leave the bearing in contact with
these agents.
2 To ensure normal rotation of the bearing, apply a
load of 1% or more of the basic dynamic load rating
at use.
5 In case of Eccentric Type Cam Followers (CFE),
the length of the mounting hole should be more
than 0.5 mm longer than the dimension B3
(Eccentric collar width) shown in the table of dimen-
sions. (See Fig. 4.)
6 For mounting Easy Mounting Type Cam Followers,
it is recommended to fix the fixing screw from the
upper side to the stepped portion of the stud. (See
Fig. 5.)

Roller Followers are bearings designed for outer
ring rotation, in which needle rollers are incorporated
in a thick walled outer ring. Both crowned and cylin-
drical outer rings are available. 	The outer rings run
directly on mating track surfaces, and the crowned
outer ring is effective in relieving the edge load
caused by mounting errors. The cylindrical outer ring,
on the other hand, has a large contact area with the
mating track surface and is suitable for applications
involving large loads or low track surface hardness.
In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings
available, the caged type and the full complement
type. 	The caged type is useful for applications at
high-speed rotation. The full complement type, on the
other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at
low-speed rotation or oscillating motions.
Roller Followers include separable and non-separable
types. Also, in addition to the open type, shield type
and sealed type are available. 	The clearances
between the side plates and outer ring of the shield
type are narrow, and form labyrinths. 	In the sealed
type, special synthetic rubber seals are assembled in
these clearances, and they are effective in preventing
penetration of dust and dirt.
These bearings are available in a variety of types to
suit almost any kind of application. They are widely
used for cam mechanisms and for linear motions of
conveying equipment.

Types
In Roller Followers, types shown in Table 1 are avail-
able.
Separable Roller Followers
These bearings are assembled by combining an outer
ring, inner ring and Needle Roller Cage, which can be
separated from one another. Thus, handling is easy.
Oil lubrication is also easy, making them suitable for
high-speed rotations.
There are two types: type without inner ring RNAST
and type with inner ring NAST. 	The type with inner
ring includes open type, shield type, and sealed type.
Non-separable Roller Followers
These non-separable type bearings have side plates
fixed on both sides of the inner ring, and include the
caged type and the full complement type. Both shield
type and sealed type are available.
Inch series Non-separable Roller Followers are full
complement type bearings and their surface is treated
with black oxide surface treatment.
Heavy Duty Type Roller Followers
These full complement type bearings incorporate
cylindrical rollers in the outer ring in two rows and can
withstand large radial loads and some axial loads.
These bearings are shield type with non-separable
structure.

Clearance
Radial internal clearances of Roller Followers are
based on Table 6.
Fit
Roller Followers are generally used under the loading
conditions in which the load direction is fixed in rela-
tion to the inner ring and rotates in relation to the
outer ring. 	The recommended fits for shafts are
shown in Table 7. 	Those for the inch series are
shown in the dimension table.
Maximum allowable static load
The load that is applicable to Roller Followers is, in
some cases, determined by the strength of the outer
ring rather than by the load rating of the needle roller
bearing. Therefore, the maximum allowable load that
is limited by the strength of outer ring is specified.
Operating temperature
The allowaple temperature range for Roller Follower
is -20 C+120 	C.

strength 1250N mm 2 ). 	When the hardness of the
mating track surface differs from 40HRC, the track
capacity is obtained by multiplying the value by the
track capacity factor shown in Table 9.
If lubrication between the outer ring and the mating
track surface is insufficient, seizure and/or wear may
occur depending on the application. 	Therefore, pay
attention to lubrication and surface roughness of the
mating track especially in the case of high-speed rota-
tion such as for cam mechanisms.
Track Capacity
Track capacity is defined as the load that can be con-
tinuously applied on a Roller Follower placed on a
steel track surface without causing deformation and
indentation on the track surface when the outer ring of
the Roller Follower makes contact with the mating
track surface (plane). The track capacities shown in
Tables 8.1 and 8.2 are applicable when the hardness
of the mating track surface is 40HRC (Tensile

Allowable Rotational Speed
The allowable rotational speed of Roller Followers is
affected by mounting and operating conditions. 	For
reference, Table 10 shows dn values when only pure
radial loads are applied. Under actual operating con-
ditions, the recommended dn 	value is 1/10 of the
value shown in the table in consideration of the axial
loads that may act on the bearing.
Lubrication
In Sealed Type Roller Followers, Heavy Duty Type
Roller Followers and 	Inch series Roller Followers,
ALVANIA GREASE S2 (SHELL) is prepacked as the
lubricating grease.
For Roller Followers without prepacked grease,
grease or oil should be supplied through the oil hole
of the inner ring for use. If they are used without lubri-
cation, wear of rolling contact surfaces may take
place, leading to a short bearing life.
Oil Hole
Open Type 	Separable Roller Followers have no oil
hole. Inner rings of other types of Metric series Roller
Followers have 	an oil hole. 	Inch series inner rings
have an oil groove and an oil hole.

without inner ring
1 In case of shield and sealed types, match the side
surface correctly to the mating seating surface indi-
cated by the dimension a shown in the dimension
table, and fix them. (See Fig. 1.)
2 When mounting Roller Followers, pay special atten-
tion to avoid locating the oil hole of the inner ring
within the loading zone. This may lead to a short
bearing life. (See Fig. 2.)
3 When mounting Sealed Type Separable Roller
Followers, do not cause the side plates to come off.
If they come off, set them again in place taking care
to avoid damaging the seal lips.
4 In case of Roller Followers without an inner ring,
the shaft requires heat treatment and grinding fin-
ish. 	The recommended surface hardness of the
shaft is 5864HRC, and the recommended rough-
ness of the shaft is 0.2 mRa or less.
Also, the outer ring and cage are guided by side
surfaces of the mounting parts. Therefore, it is rec-
ommended that the side surfaces of the mounting
parts be finished by grinding or at least by machin-
ing. (See Fig. 3.)
5 In Non-separable Roller Followers, the side plates
are press-fitted. 	Therefore, when mounting the
Roller Followers, do not push the side plates.

Structure and Features
Crossed Roller Bearings are compact bearings
with their rollers alternately crossed at right angles to
each other between inner and outer rings. They can
take loads from any directions at the same time such
as radial, thrust and moment loads. The rollers make
line-contact with raceway surfaces, and, therefore,
elastic deformation due to bearing loads is very small.
These bearings are widely used in the rotating parts
of industrial robots, machine tools, medical equip-
ment, etc., which require compactness, high rigidity
and high rotational accuracy.
In addition, bearings made of stainless steel or those
with inner and outer rings provided with mounting
holes are also available on request. Please contact
.

Types
Crossed Roller Bearings are available in the types
shown in Table 1.
High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller Bearings
Both inner and outer rings have a solid one-piece
construction. Therefore, high accuracy and high rigid-
ity are achieved, and mounting errors can be mini-
mized. As separators are incorporated between the
rollers for smooth rotation, these bearings are suitable
for applications where rotational speed is compara-
tively high.
Standard Type Crossed Roller Bearings
The outer ring is made of two split pieces, which are
bolted together to prevent separation during trans-
portation or mounting. So, handling is easy.
Slim Type Crossed Roller Bearings
These bearings are very slim bearings having a small
outside diameter, in comparison with the bore diame-
ter, and a narrow width. The type with cage and the
type with separator provide smooth rotation and are
suitable for applications where rotational speed is
comparatively high.

Load Rating and Life
Basic dynamic road rating C
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the con-
stant radial load both in direction and magnitude
under which a group of identical Crossed Roller
Bearings are individually operated and 90% of the
units in the group can rotate 1,000,000 revolutions
free from material damage due to rolling contact
fatigue.
Life
The basic rating life of Crossed Roller Bearings is
obtained from the following formula.
where, 	Basic rating life, 10 6 rev.
Basic dynamic load rating, N
Dynamic equivalent radial load, N
If the number of revolutions per minute is known, the
rating life in hours can be obtained from the following
formula.

Life in oscillating motion
When a bearing is used in oscillating motion, the life
can be obtained from the following formula.
where, 	Basic rating life in oscillating motion,

Oscillating angle, degrees (Refer to
Fig. 1)
Dynamic equivalent radial load, N
If the number of oscillations per minute n1 cpm is
given, the rating life in hours can be obtained from
formula (2) by substituting n1 for n.
When the oscillating angle 2 	is very small, an oil
film may not be formed between the rolling elements
and the raceways and fretting corrosion may occur.
In this case, please consult 	.

Basic static load rating C0
The basic static load rating is defined as the static
radial load that gives a prescribed constant contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the
rolling element and raceway receiving the maximum
load.
Static safety factor
The static safety factor fS of Crossed Roller Bearings
is obtained by the formula below and Table 2 give
standard values of this factor.

mum load), N
Load factor
Due to vibration and/or shocks during machine opera-
tion, the actual load on each bearing becomes
greater in many cases than the theoretically calculat-
ed load. The applied load is generally calculated by
multiplying the theoretically calculated load by the

Fit
The standard fits of Crossed Roller Bearings are
shown in Table 9.1. For large bearings, fit based on
the actual measured dimensions of the bearings is
recommended, and fit allowance should be chosen as
small as possible in accordance with the tolerance
class given in Table 9.1. 	When complex loads or
shock loads are applied or when high rotational accu-
racy and rigidity of the bearing are required, it is rec-
ommended to use a slight interference fit adjusted to
the actual measured dimensions for both inner and
outer rings.
For the interference fit, the radial internal clearance
after the fit decreases by approximately 70% to 90%
of the interference amount. To avoid excessive pre-
load due to fit, it is recommended to use a slight inter-
ference fit adjusted to the actual measured dimen-
sions for both T1 and C1 clearances.

Oil Hole
For Crossed Roller Bearings, oil holes and oil grooves
can be provided on bearing rings on request. When
an oil hole is required on the outer ring, attach "-OH"
before the clearance symbol in the identification num-
ber. When an oil hole and an oil groove are required
on the outer ring, attach "-OG" at the same place in
the identification number. 	For an oil hole on the
inner ring, attach "/OH", and for an oil hole and an oil
groove on the inner ring, attach "/OG", at the same
place in the identification number. High Rigidity Type
Crossed Roller Bearings have an oil groove and two
oil holes on the outer ring as standard. Table 11
shows availability of oil holes for each bearing type.

Lubrication
These bearings are generally lubricated with grease.
Grease is supplied through the clearance between the
inner ring and the outer ring.
In the sealed type bearings, ALVANIA EP GREASE 2
is prepacked as the lubricating grease.
For bearings without prepacked grease, supply
grease or oil for use. Operating without grease or oil
will increase the wear of the rolling contact surfaces
and cause a short bearing life.
When using a special grease, carefully examine the
grease properties and contents such as base oil vis-
cosity and extreme pressure additives. In this case,
please contact 	.
Allowable rotational speed
Allowable rotational speeds of Crossed Roller
Bearings are affected by mounting and operating con-
ditions. The values in general operation are shown in

Operating Temperature Range
The operating temperature range for Crossed Roller
Bearings is 	20˚C 	120˚C. 	However, the maxi-
mum allowable temperature for types with separator
and with seal is 	110˚C, and 	100˚C when they are
continuously operated.
Mounting
Fig. 3 Mounting example
1 When the rigidity of the mounting parts is insuffi-
cient, stress concentration will occur at the contact
area between the rollers and the raceways, and the
bearing performance will be deteriorated significantly .
Therefore, carefully examine the rigidity of housing
and the strength of fixing bolts when a large moment
is applied.
2 In some Crossed Roller Bearings, parts made of
synthetic resin or special synthetic rubber are used.
When the bearing must be used at temperatures high-
er than 110˚C,please consult 	.
3 The inner and outer rings should be securely fixed
in the axial direction by using fixing plates, etc.
Recommended thickness of the fixing plate is 1/2 or
more of the bearing width B. The dimensions in the
axial direction of the housing bore and the fixing
plates should be determined to get a secure fixing
while considering the dimension of bearing width
which is given a minus tolerance.
4 The shoulder height diameters (da and Da) that are
related to mounting should satisfy the values shown in
the dimension tables. 	When these dimensions are
incorrect, deformations of inner and outer rings will
occur and the bearing performance will be remarkably
impaired.
5 The depth of the housing bore is recommended to
be equal to or larger than the bearing width.
6 Separation prevention bolts for the outer ring are
provided to prevent separation of two halves of the
outer ring during transportation or mounting. 	When
mounting, they should be loosened slightly.
7 High Rigidity Type Crossed Roller Bearings and
Slim Type Crossed Roller Bearings have a plug for
hole for inserting rollers. When mounting the bearings,
locate the plug at a position that is not included in the
maximum loading zone. The plug is a press-fitted pin
that can be found on the side face of the outer ring.
