TIMKEN® TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS - 
RELIABILITY, VERSATILITY, CHOICE
DESIGN FEATURES
Each tapered roller bearing contains four interdependent 
components: the cone (inner ring), the cup (outer ring), tapered 
rollers (rolling elements) and the cage (roller retainer).
Tapered angles allow our bearings to efﬁ ciently control a 
combination of radial and thrust loads. The steeper the outer 
ring angle, the greater ability the bearing has to handle thrust 
loads. To provide a true rolling motion of the rollers on the 
raceways, the extensions of the raceways and the tapered 
surfaces of the rollers come together at a common point, the 
apex, on the axis of rotation.

SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED BEARINGS 
AND COMPONENTS
SHELF LIFE
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/
component design life as follows:
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation.
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity and 
extended storage.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
To help you get the most value from our products, Timken provides 
guidelines for the shelf life of grease-lubricated ball and roller 
bearings, components and assemblies. Shelf life information is 
based on Timken and industry test data and experience.
European REACH compliance
Timken lubricants, greases and similar products sold in 
standalone containers or delivery systems are subject to the 
European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, 
please contact your Timken engineer.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for our 
ﬁ nished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
referred to as “products”):
 • Unless directed otherwise by Timken, products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 • Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on 
the packaging.
 • Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 • After a product is removed from its packaging, it should 
be placed into service as soon as possible.
 • When removing a product that is not individually packaged 
from a bulk pack container, the container should be 
resealed immediately after the product is removed. 
 • The storage area temperature should be maintained 
between 0° C (32° F) and 40° C (104° F); temperature 
ﬂ uctuations should be minimized. 
 • The relative humidity should be maintained below 
60 percent and the surfaces should be dry. 
 • The storage area should be kept free from airborne 
contaminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, harmful 
vapors, etc. 
 • The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration. 
 • Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Most bearing components typically ship protected with a 
corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant. These 
components may be used in oil-lubricated applications without 
removal of the corrosion-preventive compound. When using 
some specialized grease lubrications, we advise you to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before packing the 
bearing components with suitable grease. 
Be careful in selecting lubrication, however, since different 
lubricants are often incompatible. 
When you receive a bearing shipment, do not remove products 
from their packaging until they are ready for mounting so they 
do not become corroded or contaminated. 
Store bearings and bearing housings in an appropriate 
atmosphere so they remain protected for the intended period.

BEARING TYPES AND CAGES
ENGINEERING
6  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
SINGLE-ROW BEARINGS
TS - SINGLE-ROW
This is the basic and the most widely used type of tapered 
roller bearing. It consists of the inner-ring assembly and the 
outer ring. It is usually ﬁtted as one of an opposing pair. During 
equipment assembly, single-row bearings can be “set” to the 
required clearance (endplay) or preload condition to optimize 
performance.
TSF - SINGLE-ROW, WITH FLANGED  

OUTER RING
The TSF type is a variation on the basic single-row bearing. TSF 
bearings have a ﬂanged outer ring to facilitate axial location and 
accurately aligned seats in a through-bored housing.
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS TYPES AND CAGES 
TDI
DOUBLE-ROW BEARINGS
TDO - DOUBLE OUTER RING
This has a one-piece (double) outer ring and two single inner 
rings. It is usually supplied complete with an inner-ring spacer 
as a pre-set assembly. This conﬁguration gives a wide effective 
bearing spread and is frequently chosen for applications where 
overturning moments are a signiﬁcant load component. TDO 
bearings can be used in ﬁxed (locating) positions or allowed to 
ﬂoat in the housing bore, for example, to compensate for shaft 
expansion. TDOCD outer rings also are available in most sizes. 
These outer rings have holes in the O.D. that permit the use of 
pins to prevent outer ring rotation in the housing.
TDI   - DOUBLE INNER RING
TDIT - DOUBLE INNER RING WITH  

TAPERED BORE
Both comprise a one-piece (double) inner ring and two single 
outer rings. They are usually supplied complete with an outer-
ring spacer as a pre-set assembly. TDI and TDIT bearings can be 
used at ﬁxed (locating) positions on rotating shaft applications. 
For rotating housing applications, the double inner ring of type 
TDI can be used to ﬂoat on the stationary shaft. Type TDIT has 
a tapered bore to facilitate removal when an interference ﬁt is 
essential, yet regular removal is required.

Fig. 6. Spacer assemblies. 
2S - TWO SINGLE-ROW ASSEMBLY
Often referred to as snap-ring assemblies, type 2S consist of 
two basic single-row bearings (type TS). They are supplied 
complete with inner-ring and outer-ring spacers to give a pre-
determined bearing setting when assembled. Type 2S have a 
speciﬁed setting range to suit the duty of the application. They 
have an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring, which also serves as 
the outer-ring spacer, to give axial location in a through-bored 
housing.
SR - SET-RIGHTTM ASSEMBLY
Type SR are made to a standard setting range, based on Timken’s 
SET-RIGHT™ automated setting technique suitable for most 
industrial applications. They have two spacers and an optional 
snap-ring that may be used for axial location. Because both types 
are made up of popular sizes of single-row bearings, they provide 
a low-cost option for many applications.
There are two basic mounting arrangements for spacer 
assemblies. 
 • Type 2TS-IM (indirect mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings with an inner-ring  

and outer-ring spacer. In some applications, the outer-ring  

spacer is replaced by a shoulder in the bearing housing.
 • Type 2TS-DM (direct mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings, with inner rings  

abutting and an outer-ring spacer. They are generally  used  

at ﬁxed (locating) positions on rotating shaft applications.

 LUBRICANT SLOTS AND EXTENDED  

 BACK FACE RIB
These three bearing types are similar to the TDO with a one-piece 
(double) outer ring and two single inner rings. The inner-ring front 
faces are extended so they abut, eliminating the need for a 
separate inner-ring spacer. Supplied with a built-in clearance to 
give a standard setting range, these bearings provide a solution 
for many ﬁxed or ﬂoating bearing applications where optimum 
simplicity of assembly is required.
Types TNASW and TNASWE are variations having chamfers 
and slots on the front face of the inner ring to provide lubrication 
through the shaft. Type TNASWE have extended back face ribs 
on the inner rings which are ground on the O.D. to allow for the 
use of a seal or stamped closure. These designs are typically 
used on stationary shaft applications.

SPACER ASSEMBLIES
Any two single-row bearings (type TS) can be supplied as a 
double-row, pre-set, ready-to-ﬁt assembly by the addition of 
spacers, machined to pre-determined dimensions and tolerances. 
Spacer assemblies are provided in two types: "2S" and "SR". This 
concept can be applied to produce custom-made double-row 
bearings to suit speciﬁc applications. In addition to providing 
a bearing that automatically gives a pre-determined setting at 
assembly without the need for a manual setting, it is possible 
to modify the assembly width to suit an application, simply by 
varying the spacer widths.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CAGES
STAMPED-STEEL CAGES
The most common type of cage used for tapered roller bearings 
is the stamped-steel cage. These cages are mass produced 
from low-carbon sheet steel using a series of cutting, forming 
and punching operations. These cages can be used in high 
temperature and harsh lubricant environments.  
Fig. 8. Stamped-steel cage. 
POLYMER CAGES
Cages for tapered roller bearings made of polymer material are 
used primarily for pre-greased and sealed package designs. The 
most common polymer materials used are Nylon thermoplastics 
with glass reinforcement. Polymer cages can be mass produced 
in large quantities and offer more design ﬂexibility than stamped-
steel types. Polymer cages are lightweight and easy to assemble. 
In some instances, increased bearing rating can be achieved 
by allowing one or two extra rollers in the bearing complement. 
Care should be exercised when using aggressive lubricants with 
EP (extreme-pressure) additives in combination with elevated 
temperatures greater than 107° C (225° F).  
CAGES
ENGINEERING
8  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
MACHINED CAGES
Machined cages for tapered roller bearings are robust in design 
and are suited for high-speed and high-load applications. 
Machined cages use alloy steels and are produced through 
milling and broaching operations. Assembly does not require 
a close-in operation and rollers can be retained using nibs or 
staking. Oil holes also can be easily added for extra lubrication 
for demanding applications. Some designs are silver plated for 
special applications.  
PIN-TYPE CAGES
Tapered roller bearing pin-type cages retain the rolling elements 
by the use of a pin located through an axial hole in the center of 
the roller. Pin-type cages for tapered roller bearings consist of 
two rings with roller pins attached by screw threads at one end 
and welding at the other end. These types of cages are primarily 
used for larger tapered roller bearing designs (greater than 
400 mm [15.7480 in.] O.D.). Pin-type cages are machined out 
of steel and typically allow for an increased number of rolling 
elements. Pin-type cages are restricted to low-speed applications 
(less than 20 m/sec [4000 ft/min] rib speed).

(1)SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.
METRIC SYSTEM BEARINGS (ISO AND J PREFIX PARTS)
tolerances lie within those currently speciﬁed in ISO 492 with 
the exception of a small number of dimensions indicated in the 
tables. The differences normally have an insigniﬁcant effect on 
the mounting and performance of tapered roller bearings.
Timken manufactures metric system bearings to six tolerance 
classes. Classes K and N are often referred to as standard 
classes. Class N has more closely controlled width tolerances 
than K. Classes C, B, A and AA are precision classes. These

Inner Ring Stand. Inner 
Ring stand is a measure of 
the variation in Inner Ring 
raceway size, taper and roller 
diameter. This is checked by 
measuring the axial location 
of the reference surface of 
a master outer ring or other 
type gauge with respect to the 
reference Inner Ring face.

Outer Ring Stand. Outer 
ring stand is a measure of 
the variation in outer ring 
I.D. size and taper. This 
is checked by measuring 
the axial location of the 
reference surface of a 
master plug or other type 
gauge with respect to the 
reference face of the outer 
ring. 
(1)Stand for flanged outer ring is measured from flange backface (seating face).
(2)These sizes manufactured as matched assemblies only.

(1)SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.
Runout. Runout is a measure 
of rotational accuracy 
expressed by Total Indicator 
Reading (T.I.R.). Total 
displacement is measured 
by an instrument sensing 
against a moving surface, 
or moved with respect to a 
ﬁxed surface. A radial runout 
measurement includes both 
roundness errors and the 
centering error of the surface 
that the instrument head 
senses against.

(1)For TSL bearings these are the normal tolerances of inner ring bore. However, bore size can be slightly reduced at large end due to tight ﬁt   
 assembly of the seal on the rib. This should not have any effect on the performance of the bearing.

(1)Stand for ﬂanged outer ring is measured from ﬂange backface (seating face).
(2)These sizes manufactured as matched assemblies only. 
Inner Ring Stand. Inner Ring 
stand is a measure of the varia-
tion in Inner Ring raceway size, 
taper and roller diameter. This is 
checked by measuring the axial 
location of the reference surface 
of a master outer ring or other 
type gauge with respect to the 
reference Inner Ring face.
Outer Ring Stand. Outer 
ring stand is a measure of 
the variation in outer ring 
I.D. size and taper. This 
is checked by measuring 
the axial location of the 
reference surface of a 
master plug or other type 
gauge with respect to the  
reference face of the outer 
ring.

Runout. Runout is a measure 
of rotational accuracy 
expressed by Total Indicator 
Reading (T.I.R.). Total 
displacement is measured 
by an instrument sensing 
against a moving surface, 
or moved with respect to a 
ﬁxed surface. A radial runout 
measurement includes both 
roundness errors and the 
centering error of the surface 
that the instrument head 
senses against.

MOUNTING, FITTING AND SETTING
ENGINEERING
26  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
MOUNTING 
Tapered roller bearings are designed to take both radial and 
thrust loading. Under radial loads, a force is generated in the 
axial direction that must be counteracted. As a result, tapered 
roller bearings are normally adjusted against a second bearing. 
They can be mounted in either a direct or indirect mounting 
arrangement shown in ﬁg. 9. For applications where a direct 
mounting arrangement is used and the outer ring is used to adjust 
the bearing setting, the outer ring is usually set in position by an 
outer-ring follower or mounted in an outer-ring carrier. See ﬁg. 10. 
For indirect mountings, bearing setting is typically achieved by 
clamping against one of the inner rings. Various designs, including 
locknuts, stakenuts and end plates as shown in ﬁg. 11 can be used. 
For applications requiring precision-class bearings, a special 
precision nut can be used.
Backing shoulder diameters are listed for tapered roller bearings 
in the product data sections in this catalog.

FITTING PRACTICE 
General industrial application fitting practice standards for 
inner rings and outer rings are shown in the tables starting on 
page 32. These tables apply to solid or heavy-sectioned steel 
shafts, heavy-sectioned ferrous housings and normal operating 
conditions. To use the tables, it is necessary to determine if the 
member is rotating or stationary, the magnitude, direction and 
type of loading, and the shaft ﬁnish.

Certain table ﬁts may not be adequate for light shaft and housing 
sections, shafts other than steel, nonferrous housings, critical 
operation conditions such as high speed, unusual thermal or 
loading conditions or a combination thereof. Also, assembly 
procedures and the means and ease of obtaining the bearing 
setting may require special ﬁts. In these cases, experience 
should be used as a guideline or your Timken engineer should 
be consulted for review and suggestions.
Rotating inner rings generally should be applied with an 
interference ﬁt. In special cases, loose ﬁts may be considered 
if it has been determined by test or experience they will perform 
satisfactorily. The term “rotating inner ring” describes a condition 
in which the inner ring rotates relative to the load. This may occur 
with a rotating inner ring under a stationary load or a stationary 
inner ring with a rotating load. Loose ﬁts will permit the inner 
rings to creep and wear the shaft and the backing shoulder. This 
may result in excessive bearing looseness and possible bearing 
and shaft damage.
Stationary inner ring ﬁtting practice depends on the application. 
Under conditions of high speed, heavy loads or shock, interference 
ﬁts using heavy-duty ﬁtting practices should be used. With inner 
rings mounted on unground shafts subjected to moderate loads 
(no shock) and moderate speeds, a metal-to-metal or near zero 
average ﬁt is used. In sheave and wheel applications using 
unground shafts, or in cases using ground shafts with moderate 
loads (no shock), a minimum ﬁt near zero to a maximum looseness 
that varies with the inner ring bore size is suggested. In stationary 
inner ring applications requiring hardened and ground spindles, 
a slightly looser ﬁt may be satisfactory. Special ﬁts also may be 
necessary on installations such as multiple sheave crane blocks. 
Rotating outer ring applications where the outer ring rotates 
relative to the load should always use an interference ﬁt. 
Stationary, non-adjustable and fixed single-row outer ring 
applications should be applied with a tight ﬁt wherever practical. 
Generally, adjustable ﬁts may be used where the bearing setup 
is obtained by sliding the outer ring axially in the housing bore. 
However, in certain heavy-duty, high-load applications, tight ﬁts 
are necessary to prevent pounding and plastic deformation of 
the housing. Tightly ﬁtted outer rings mounted in carriers can 
be used. Tight ﬁts should always be used when the load rotates 
relative to the outer ring.
To permit through-boring when the outside diameters of single-
row bearings mounted at each end of a shaft are equal, and one 
is adjustable and the other ﬁxed, it is suggested that the same 
adjustable ﬁt be used at both ends. However, tight ﬁts should 
be used if outer rings are backed against snap rings to prevent 
excessive dishing of snap rings, groove wear and possible loss 
of ring retention. Only outer rings with a maximum housing 
ﬁllet radius requirement of 1.3 mm (0.05 in.) or less should be 
considered for a snap ring backing.
Double-row stationary double outer rings are generally mounted 
with loose ﬁts to permit assembly and disassembly. The loose 
fit also permits float when a floating bearing is mounted in 
conjunction with an axially ﬁxed bearing on the other end of 
the shaft.
Fitting practice tables 22-32 on pages 32-46, have been prepared 
for both metric and inch dimensions.
For the inch system bearings, classes 4 and 2 (standard) have 
been included.
The metric system bearings that have been included are: classes 
K and N (metric system standard bearings).

Interference ﬁts on thin-walled shafts and light-section steel 
housings have a tendency to collapse the inner ring seat and 
stretch the outer ring seat, resulting in less change in bearing 
setting and overall width. The effects can be calculated according 
to the following formulas.
Inner ring setting reduction/width increase:
Outer ring setting reduction/width increase:
For shaft or housing material other than steel, consult your 
Timken engineer. 
Effects of tight ﬁts on bearing setting/width
Interference ﬁts of the inner ring cause inner ring expansion and 
interference ﬁts of the outer ring cause outer ring contraction. As 
the inner ring diameters increase and the outer ring diameters 
decrease, internal clearance within the bearing is reduced and 
bearing width is increased. The change in clearance or setting 
is approximately equal to the change in width.  
For matched assemblies where the setting is pre-set from the 
factory and SET-RIGHT assemblies, the effects of ﬁt must be taken 
into account to provide the desired mounted setting. 
Double-row and four-row bearings that are provided with spacers 
are examples of matched assemblies. These bearings are pre-set 
to a speciﬁc bench endplay or axial clearance prior to installation 
into the application. Mounting the bearing with a tight ﬁt will 
reduce this bench endplay. In order to meet the desired mounted 
setting, the bench endplay must be compensated for the ﬁt effect.
SET-RIGHT assemblies rely on the control of bearing, shaft and 
housing tolerances to known distributions, resulting in a statistical 
mounted bearing setting range. This mounted setting takes into 
account any reductions in setting due to tight ﬁts.
Bearing width increase can affect setting in applications such as 
outer-ring-adjusted, direct-mounting designs. In this case, a shim 
is inserted between the outer ring and a backing plate. Tight ﬁts 
will affect calculation of the shim thickness. In other applications 
where axial tolerance summation calculations are made, tight ﬁt 
effects must be taken into consideration.

Axial Endplay
SETTING
Setting is deﬁned as the axial clearance between roller and 
raceway. Establishing the setting at the time of assembly is an 
inherent advantage of tapered roller bearings. They can be set 
to provide optimum performance in almost any application. Fig. 
13 gives an example of the relationship between fatigue life 
and bearing setting. Unlike some types of anti-friction bearings, 
tapered roller bearings do not rely strictly on housing or shaft 
ﬁts to obtain a certain bearing setting. One ring can be moved 
axially relative to the other to obtain the desired bearing setting.
At assembly, the conditions of bearing setting are deﬁned as:
 • Endplay (EP) – An axial clearance 
between rollers and raceways 
producing a measurable axial shaft 
movement when a small axial force 
is applied – ﬁrst in one direction 
then in the other, while oscillating 
or rotating the shaft. See ﬁg. 14.
 • Preload (PL) – An axial interference 
between rollers and raceways such 
that there is no measurable axial 
shaft movement when a small  
axial force is applied – in both 
directions – while oscillating or 
rotating the shaft.
 • Line-to-line – A zero setting  
condition: the transitional point 
between endplay and preload.
Bearing setting obtained during initial assembly and adjustment 
is the cold or ambient bearing setting, and is established before 
the equipment is subjected to service.
Bearing setting during operation is known as the operating 
bearing setting, and is a result of changes in the ambient bearing 
setting due to thermal expansion and deﬂections encountered 
during service.
The ambient bearing setting necessary to produce the optimum 
operating bearing setting varies with the application. Application 
experience or testing generally determines optimum settings. 
Frequently, however, the exact relationship of ambient to 
operating bearing setting is unknown and an educated estimate 
has to be made. To determine a suggested ambient bearing setting 
for a speciﬁc application, contact your Timken engineer.
Generally, the ideal operating bearing setting is near zero to 
maximize bearing life (ﬁg. 13). Most bearings are set with endplay 
at assembly to reach the desired near-zero setting at operating 
temperature. 
There is an ideal bearing setting value for every application. To 
achieve this condition, the bearing setting must take into account 
deﬂection under load (radial + axial) as well as thermal expansions 
and material used. 
1. Standard mounting

Operating setting  =  mounted setting ± temperature effect + 

deﬂection
2. Pre-set assemblies

The temperature and ﬁt effects will depend upon the type of 
mounting, bearing geometry and size, shaft and housing sizes, 
and material as deﬁned in the following sections. Dimensional 
parameters affecting bearing setting are noted in ﬁg. 15.

Setting methods
Upper and lower limits of bearing setting values are determined 
by consideration of the following factors:
 • Application type.
 • Duty cycle/loading.
 • Operational features of adjacent mechanical drive 
elements.
 • Changes in bearing setting due to temperature differentials 
and deﬂections.
 • Size of bearing and method of obtaining bearing setting.
 • Lubrication method.
 • Housing and shaft material.
The setting value to be applied during assembly will depend on 
any changes that may occur during operation. In the absence of 
experience with bearings of similar size and operating conditions, 
a bearing setting range suggestion should be obtained from your 
Timken engineer.

(1)Does not apply to TNASW and TNASWE type bearings. 
(2)Example: If the minimum inner ring bore is 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) the suggested shaft size = 76.238 mm (3.0015 in.) to 76.225 mm (3.0010 in.)  
 for an inner ring ﬁt of 0.038 mm (0.0015 in.) tight to 0.012 mm (0.0005 in.) tight. 
(3)For inner ring bores between 76.200 mm (3.0000 in.) and 101.600 mm (4.0000 in.) use a minimum ﬁt of 0.025 mm (0.0001 in.) tight.

THRUST TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Tolerances for housing bore and shaft diameters are shown 
as variance from nominal bearing dimension. When one ring is 
piloted by the housing, sufﬁcient clearances must be allowed at 
the outside diameter of the other ring as well as at the bore of both 
rings to prevent cross-loading of the rollers. For most applications, 
this clearance is approximately 1⁄16 in. (1.588 mm, 0.0625 in.).

OPERATING TEMPERATURES
ENGINEERING
 TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  47
OPERATING TEMPERATURES
Bearings operate in a wide range of applications and environments. 
In most cases, bearing operating temperature is not an issue. 
Some applications, however, operate at extreme speeds or in 
extreme temperature environments. In these cases, care must 
be taken not to exceed the temperature limits of the bearing. 
Minimum temperature limits are primarily based on lubricant 
capability. Maximum temperature limits are most often based 
on material and/or lubricant constraints, but also may be based 
on accuracy requirements of the equipment that the bearings 
are built into. These constraints/limitations are discussed below.
BEARING MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
Standard bearing steels with a standard heat treatment cannot 
maintain a minimum hardness of 58 HRC much above 120° C 
(250° F).  
Dimensional stability of Timken bearings is managed through the 
proper selection of an appropriate heat-treat process. Standard 
Timken tapered roller and ball bearings are dimensionally stabilized 
from -54° C (-65° F) up to 120° C (250° F), while standard spherical 
roller bearings are dimensionally stabilized up to 200° C (392° F) and 
standard cylindrical roller bearings are stabilized up to 150° C 
(302° F). Upon request, these bearings can be ordered to higher 
levels of stability as listed below. These designations are in 
agreement with DIN Standard 623.

With dimensionally stabilized product, there still may be some 
changes in dimensions during service as a result of microstructural 
transformations. These transformations include the continued 
tempering of martensite and decomposition of retained austenite. 
The magnitude of change depends on the operating temperature, 
the time at temperature and the composition and heat-treatment of 
the steel.
Temperatures exceeding the limits shown in table 33 require 
special high-temperature steel. Consult your Timken engineer for 
availability of specific part numbers for non-standard heat 
stability or high-temperature steel grades.
Suggested materials for use in balls, rings and rollers at various 
operating temperatures are listed in table 34. Also listed are 
chemical composition recommendations, hardness recom-
mendations and dimensional stability information.  
Operating temperature affects lubricant ﬁlm thickness and setting, 
both of which directly influence bearing life. Extremely high 
temperatures can result in a reduced ﬁlm thickness that can lead 
to asperity contact between contacting surfaces.
Operating temperature also can affect performance of cages, 
seals and shields, which in turn can affect bearing performance. 
Materials for these components and their operating temperature 
ranges are shown in table 35.
LUBRICATION LIMITATIONS
Starting torque in grease-lubricated applications typically increases 
signiﬁcantly at cold temperatures. Starting torque is not primarily 
a function of the consistency or channel properties of the grease. 
Most often, it is a function of the rheological properties of the grease. 
The high-temperature limit for greases is generally a function of the 
thermal and oxidation stability of the base oil in the grease and the 
effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors.   
See the LUBRICATION AND SEALS section on page 55 for more 
information on lubrication limitations.
EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The equipment designer must evaluate the effects of temperature 
on the performance of the equipment being designed. Precision 
machine tool spindles, for example, can be very sensitive to thermal 
expansions. For some spindles, it is important that the temperature 
rise over ambient be held to 20° C to 35° C (36° F to 45° F). 
Most industrial equipment can operate at considerably higher 
temperatures. Thermal ratings on gear drives, for example, are 
based on 93° C (200° F). Equipment such as gas turbines operates 
continuously at temperatures above 100° C (212° F). Running at high 
temperatures for extended periods of time, however, may affect 
shaft and housing ﬁts, if the shaft and housing are not machined 
and heat-treated properly.  
Although bearings can operate satisfactorily up to 120° C (250° F),

an upper temperature limit of 80° C to 95° C (176° F to 203° F) is more 
practical. Higher operating temperatures increase the risk of 
damage from transient temperature spikes. Prototype testing of the 
application can help deﬁne the operating temperature range and 
should be conducted if possible. It is the responsibility of the 
equipment designer to weigh all relevant factors and make the ﬁnal 
determination of satisfactory operating temperature.

OPERATING TEMPERATURES
ENGINEERING
50  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
Bearing operating temperature is dependent upon a number 
of factors, including heat generation of all contributing heat 
sources, heat ﬂow rate between sources and the ability of the 
system to dissipate the heat. Heat sources include such things as 
bearings, seals, gears, clutches and oil supply. Heat dissipation is 
affected by many factors, including shaft and housing materials 
and designs, lubricant circulation and external environmental 
conditions. These and other factors are discussed in the following 
sections.  
HEAT GENERATION
Under normal operating conditions, most of the torque and heat 
generated by the bearing is caused by the elastohydrodynamic 
losses at the roller/ring contacts.
Heat generation is the product of bearing torque and speed. The 
following equation is used to calculate the heat generated.

Qgen  =  k4n M
If the bearing is tapered, the torque can be calculated using the 
following equation.

M 
= k1G1 (nμ)0.62 (Peq) 0.3
Where:
k1  
=  bearing torque constant

= 2.56 x 10-6 for M in N-m

= 3.54 x 10-5 for M in lbf-in.
k4 
=  0.105 for Qgen in W when M in N-m

=  6.73 x 10-4 for Qgen in Btu/min when M in lbf-in.
HEAT DISSIPATION
The problem of determining the heat ﬂow from a bearing in a 
speciﬁc application is rather complex. In general, it can be said 
that factors affecting the rate of heat dissipation include the 
following:
1.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the housing. This is 
affected by size conﬁguration of the house and any external 
cooling such as fans, water cooling or fan action of the rotating 
components.
2.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the shaft. Any other 
heat sources, such as gears and additional bearings and 
their proximity to the bearing considered, will inﬂuence the 
temperature of the shaft.
3.  The heat carried away by a circulating oil system. 
To what extent nos. 1 and 2 can be controlled will depend on 
the application. The heat-dissipation modes include conduction 
through the system, convection along the inside and outside 
surfaces of the system, as well as radiation exchange to and 
from neighboring structures. In many applications, overall heat 
dissipation can be divided into two categories – heat removed by 
circulating oil and heat removed through the structure. 
Heat dissipation by circulating oil
The amount of heat removed by the lubricant can be controlled 
more easily. In a splash lubrication system, cooling coils may be 
used to control the bulk oil temperature.
The amount of heat carried away in a circulating oil system by 
the lubricant can be approximated from the following equations.

Qoil =  k6 Cpf (o - i)
Where:

  k6  =  1.67 x 10-5 for Qoil in W

=  1.67 x 10-2 for Qoil in Btu/min
If the circulating lubricant is petroleum oil, the heat removed is 
further approximated by the following:

Qoil  =  k5 f (o - i) 
The following factors apply to the heat generation and dissipation 
equations listed on this page.
Where:

  k5 =  28 for Qoil in W when f in L/min and  in °C

=  0.42 for Qoil in Btu/min when f in U.S. pt/min 

 and  in °F

RUNNING TORQUE-M
The rotational resistance of a rolling bearing depends on load, 
speed, lubrication conditions and internal bearing characteristics.
The following formulas yield approximations to values of bearing 
running torque. The formulas apply to bearings lubricated by oil. 
For bearings lubricated by grease or oil mist, torque is usually 
lower, although for grease lubrication this depends on amount 
and consistency of the grease. The formulas also assume the 
bearing running torque has stabilized after an initial period 
referred to as running-in.

LUBRICATION
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG 55
LUBRICATION
To help maintain a bearing’s antifriction 
characteristics, lubrication is needed to:
 • Minimize rolling resistance due to 
deformation of the rolling elements 
and raceway under load by separating 
the mating surfaces.
 • Minimize sliding friction occurring 
between rolling elements, raceways and cage.
 • Transfer heat (with oil lubrication).
 • Protect from corrosion and, with grease lubrication, 
from contaminant ingress.

LUBRICATION
The wide range of bearing types and operating conditions 
precludes any simple, all-inclusive statement or guideline 
allowing the selection of the proper lubricant. At the design 
level, the ﬁrst consideration is whether oil or grease is best for 
the particular operation. The advantages of oil and grease are 
outlined in the table below. When heat must be carried away 
from the bearing, oil must be used. It is almost always preferred 
for very high-speed applications.

OIL LUBRICATION
Oils used for bearing lubrication should be high-quality mineral 
oils or synthetic oils with similar properties. Selection of the 
proper type of oils depends on bearing speed, load, operating 
temperature and lubrication method. Some features and 
advantages of oil lubrication, in addition to the above are:
 • Oil is a better lubricant for high speeds or high tempera-
tures. It can be cooled to help reduce bearing temperature.
 • It is easier to handle and control the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearing. It is harder to retain in the bearing. 
Lubricant losses may be higher than with grease.
 • Oil can be introduced to the bearing in many ways, such as 
drip-feed, wick-feed, pressurized circulating systems, oil bath 
or air-oil mist. Each is suited for certain types of applications.
 • Oil is easier to keep clean for recirculating systems.
Oil may be introduced to the bearing housing in many ways. 
The most common systems are:
 • Oil bath. The housing is designed to provide a sump 
through which the rolling elements of the bearing will pass. 
Generally, the oil level should be no higher than the center 
point of the lowest rolling element. If speed is high, lower  
oil levels should be used to reduce churning. Gages or  
controlled elevation drains are used to achieve and  
maintain the proper oil level.
 • Circulating system. This system has the advantages of:
• An adequate supply of oil for both cooling and 
lubrication.
• Metered control of the quantity of oil delivered to  
each bearing.
• Removal of contaminants and moisture from the 
bearing by ﬂushing action.
• Suitability for multiple bearing installations.
• Large reservoir, which reduces deterioration. 
Increased lubricant life provides economical 
efﬁciency.
• Incorporation of oil-ﬁltering devices.
• Positive control to deliver the lubricant where needed.
• A typical circulating oil system consists of an oil 
reservoir, pump, piping and ﬁlter. A heat exchange  
may be required.
 • Oil-mist lubrication. Oil-mist lubrication systems are used 
in high-speed, continuous-operation applications. This 
system permits close control of the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearings. The oil may be metered, atomized 
by compressed air and mixed with air, or it may be picked 
up from a reservoir using a venturi effect. In either case, 
the air is ﬁltered and supplied under sufﬁcient pressure to 
assure adequate lubrication of the bearings. Control of this 
type of lubrication system is accomplished by monitoring the 
operating temperatures of the bearings being lubricated. The 
continuous passage of the pressurized air and oil through the 
labyrinth seals used in the system prevents the entrance of 
contaminants from the atmosphere to the system.
The successful operation of this type of system is based 
upon the following factors: 
• Proper location of the lubricant entry ports in relation 
to the bearings being lubricated.
• Avoidance of excessive pressure drops across void 
spaces within the system.
• Proper air pressure and oil quantity ratio to suit the  
particular application.
• Adequate exhaust of the air-oil mist after lubrication 
has been accomplished.

LUBRICATION
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  57
Lubricating oils are commercially available in many forms for 
automotive, industrial, aircraft and other uses. Oils are classiﬁed 
as either petroleum types (reﬁned from crude oil) or synthetic 
types (produced by chemical synthesis).
PETROLEUM OILS 
Petroleum oils are made from a petroleum hydrocarbon derived 
from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. 
Petroleum oils are used for nearly all oil-lubricated applications 
of bearings. 
SYNTHETIC OILS
Synthetic oils cover a broad range of categories and include 
polyalphaoleﬁns, silicones, polyglycols and various esters. In 
general, synthetic oils are less prone to oxidation and can operate 
at extreme hot or cold temperatures. Physical properties, such as 
pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients, tend to vary between oil types; 
use caution when making oil selections.
The polyalphaoleﬁns (PAO) have a hydrocarbon chemistry that 
parallels petroleum oil both in chemical structures and pressure-
viscosity coefﬁcients. Therefore, PAO oil is mostly used in the 
oil-lubricated applications of bearings when severe temperature 
environments (hot and cold) are encountered or when extended 
lubricant life is required. 
The silicone, ester and polyglycol oils have an oxygen-based 
chemistry that is structurally quite different from petroleum 
oils and PAO oils. This difference has a profound effect on its 
physical properties where pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients can 
be lower compared to mineral and PAO oils. This means that 
these types of synthetic oils may actually generate a smaller 
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁlm thickness than a mineral or PAO 
oil of equal viscosity at operating temperature. Reductions in 
bearing fatigue life and increases in bearing wear could result 
from this reduction of lubricant ﬁlm thickness.
VISCOSITY
The selection of oil viscosity for any bearing application requires 
consideration of several factors: load, speed, bearing setting, 
type of oil and environmental factors. Since oil viscosity varies 
inversely with temperature, a viscosity value must always be 
stated with the temperature at which it was determined. High- 
viscosity oil is used for low-speed or high-ambient-temperature 
applications. Low-viscosity oil is used for high-speed or low-
ambient-temperature applications.
There are several classiﬁcations of oils based on viscosity grades. 
The most familiar are the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
classiﬁcations for automotive engine and gear oils. The American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) have adopted standard 
viscosity grades for industrial ﬂuids. Fig. 21 shows the viscosity 
comparisons of ISO/ASTM with SAE classiﬁcation systems at 
40° C (104° F).

To ensure “wetting” of the bearings, and to prevent 
possible damage to the rolling elements and rings, it is 
imperative that the oil-mist system be turned on for several 
minutes before the equipment is started. The importance of 
“wetting” the bearing before starting cannot be overstated, 
and it also has particular signiﬁcance for equipment that 
has been idled for extended periods of time.

Industrial EP gear oils should be composed of a highly reﬁned 
petroleum oil-based stock plus appropriate inhibitors and 
additives. They should not contain materials that are corrosive 
or abrasive to bearings. The inhibitors should provide long-term 
protection from oxidation and protect the bearing from corrosion 
in the presence of moisture. The oils should resist foaming in 
service and have good water-separation properties. An EP 
additive protects against scoring under boundary-lubrication 
conditions. The viscosity grades suggested represent a wide 
range. High-temperature and/or slow-speed applications 
generally require the higher viscosity grades. Low temperatures 
and/or high speeds require the use of lower viscosity grades.

GREASE LUBRICATION
Grease lubrication is generally applicable to low-to-moderate 
speed applications that have operating temperatures within the 
limits of the grease. There is no universal anti-friction bearing 
grease. Each grease has limiting properties and characteristics.
Greases consist of a base oil, a thickening agent and additives. 
Conventionally, bearing greases have consisted of petroleum 
base oils thickened to the desired consistency by some form 
of metallic soap. More recently synthetic base oils have been 
used with organic and inorganic thickeners. Table 41 summarizes 
the composition of typical lubricating greases.

Calcium- and aluminum-based greases have excellent water 
resistance and are used in industrial applications where water 
ingress is an issue. Lithium-based greases are multi-purpose and 
are used in industrial applications and wheel bearings. 
Synthetic base oils such as esters, organic esters and silicones 
used with conventional thickeners and additives typically have 
higher maximum operating temperatures than petroleum-based 
greases. Synthetic greases can be designed to operate in 
temperatures from -73° C (-100° F) to 288° C (550° F).

ester base oils increases the maximum operating temperature 
by approximately 10° C (50° F).
Using polyurea as a thickener for lubricating ﬂuids is one of the 
most signiﬁcant lubrication developments in more than 30 years. 
Polyurea grease performance is outstanding in a wide range of 
bearing applications and, in a relatively short time, it has gained 
acceptance as a factory-packed lubricant for ball bearings.
LOW TEMPERATURES
Starting torque in a grease-lubricated bearing at low temperatures 
can be critical. Some greases may function adequately as long 
as the bearing is operating, but resistance to initial movement 
may be excessive. In certain smaller machines, starting may be 
impossible when very cold. Under such operating circumstances, 
greases containing low-temperature characteristic oils are 
generally required.
If the operating temperature range is wide, synthetic greases 
offer advantages. Synthetic greases are available to provide very 
low starting and running torque at temperatures as low as -73° 
C (-100° F). In certain instances, these greases perform better in 
this respect than oil.
An important point concerning lubricating greases is that the 
starting torque is not necessarily a function of the consistency 
or the channel properties of the grease. Starting torque is more 
a function of the individual rheological properties of a particular 
grease and is best evaluated by application experience.
HIGH TEMPERATURES
The high temperature limit for lubricating greases is generally 
a function of the thermal and oxidation stability of the ﬂuid and 
the effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors. Grease temperature 
ranges are deﬁned by both the dropping point of the grease 
thickener and composition of the base oil. Table 43 shows 
the temperature ranges of various base oils used in grease 
formulations. 
A rule of thumb, developed from years of testing grease-
lubricated bearings, indicates that grease life is halved for every 
10° C (50° F) increase in temperature. For example, if a particular 
grease provides 2000 hours of life at 90° C (194° F), by raising the 
temperature to 100° C (212° F), reduction in life to approximately 
1000 hours would result. On the other hand, 4000 hours could be 
expected by lowering the temperature to 80° C (176° F).
Thermal stability, oxidation resistance and temperature limitations

LUBRICATION
60  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG
must be considered when selecting greases for high-temperature 
applications. In non-relubricatable applications, highly reﬁned 
mineral oils or chemically stable synthetic ﬂuids are required 
as the oil component of greases for operation at temperatures 
above 121° C (250° F).
CONTAMINATION
Abrasive Particles
When roller bearings operate in a clean environment, the primary 
cause of damage is the eventual fatigue of the surfaces where 
rolling contact occurs. However, when particle contamination 
enters the bearing system, it is likely to cause damage such as 
bruising, which can shorten bearing life.
When dirt from the environment or metallic wear debris from 
some component in the application are allowed to contaminate 
the lubricant, wear can become the predominant cause of 
bearing damage. If bearing wear becomes signiﬁcant, changes 
will occur to critical bearing dimensions that could adversely 
affect machine operation.
Bearings operating in a contaminated lubricant exhibit a higher 
initial rate of wear than those running in an uncontaminated 
lubricant. With no further contaminant ingress, this wear rate 
quickly diminishes. The contamination particles are reduced 
in size as they pass through the bearing contact area during 
normal operation.
Water
Water and moisture can be particularly conducive to bearing 
damage. Lubricating greases may provide a measure of 
protection from this contamination. Certain greases, such as 
calcium and aluminum-complex, are highly water-resistant.
Sodium-soap greases are water-soluble and should not be used 
in applications involving water.
Either dissolved or suspended water in lubricating oils can exert 
a detrimental inﬂuence on bearing fatigue life. Water can cause 
bearing etching that also can reduce bearing fatigue life. The 
exact mechanism by which water lowers fatigue life is not fully 
understood. It has been suggested that water enters micro-cracks 
in the bearing rings that are caused by repeated stress cycles. 
This leads to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement in the micro-
cracks, reducing the time required for these cracks to propagate 
to an unacceptable-sized spall.
Water-based ﬂuids, such as water glycol and invert emulsions, 
also have shown a reduction in bearing fatigue life. Although 
water from these sources is not the same as contamination, 
the results support the previous discussion concerning water-
contaminated lubricants.
GREASE SELECTION
The successful use of bearing grease depends on the physical 
and chemical properties of the lubricant as well as application 
and environmental conditions. Because the choice of grease 
for a particular bearing under certain service conditions is often 
difﬁcult to make, you should consult with your lubricant supplier 
or equipment maker for speciﬁc questions about lubrication 
requirements for your application. You also can contact your 
Timken engineer for general lubrication guidelines for any 
application.
Grease must be carefully selected with regard to its consistency 
at operating temperature. It should not exhibit thickening, 
separation of oil, acid formation or hardening to any marked 
degree. It should be smooth, non-ﬁbrous and entirely free from 
chemically active ingredients. Its dropping point should be 
considerably higher than the operating temperature.

GREASE USE GUIDELINES
It is important to use the proper amount of grease in the 
application. In typical industrial applications, the bearing cavity 
should be kept approximately one-third to one-half full. Less 
grease may result in the bearing being starved for lubrication. 
More grease may result in churning. Both conditions may result 
in excessive heat generation. As the grease temperature rises, 
viscosity decreases and the grease becomes thinner. This can 
reduce the lubricating effect and increase leakage of the grease 
from the bearing. It also may cause the grease components 
to separate, leading to a general breakdown of the lubricant 
properties. As the grease breaks down, bearing torque increases. 
In the case of excess grease resulting in churning, torque may 
also increase due to the resistance caused by the grease.  
For best results, there should be ample space in the housing to 
allow room for excess grease to be thrown from the bearing. 
However, it is equally important that the grease be retained all 
around the bearing. If a large void exists between the bearings, 
grease closures should be used to prevent the grease from 
leaving the bearing area.
Only in low-speed applications may the housing be entirely ﬁlled 
with grease. This method of lubrication is a safeguard against the 
entry of foreign matter, where sealing provisions are inadequate 
for exclusion of contaminants or moisture.
During periods of non-operation, it is often wise to completely ﬁll 
the housings with grease to protect the bearing surfaces. Prior 
to restarting operation, remove the excess grease and restore 
the proper level.
Applications utilizing grease lubrication should have a grease 
ﬁtting and a vent at opposite ends of the housing near the top. A 
drain plug should be located near the bottom of the housing to 
allow the old grease to purge from the bearing.
Bearings should be relubricated at regular intervals to help 
prevent damage. Relubrication intervals are difﬁcult to determine. 
If plant practice or experience with other applications is not 
available, consult your lubricant supplier.
Timken offers a range of lubricants to help bearings and 
related components operate effectively in demanding industrial 
operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant 
additives offer greater protection in challenging environments. 
Timken also offers a line of single- and multi-point lubricators to 
simplify grease delivery.
Grease application methods
Grease, in general, is easier to use than oil in industrial bearing 
lubrication applications. Most bearings that are initially packed 
with grease require periodic relubrication to operate efﬁciently.
Grease should be packed into the bearing so that it gets between 
the rolling elements – the rollers or balls. For tapered roller 
bearings, forcing grease through the bearing from the large end 
to the small end will ensure proper distribution.
Grease can be easily packed into small- and medium-size 
bearings by hand (ﬁg. 23). In shops where bearings are frequently 
regreased, a mechanical grease packer that forces grease 
through the bearing under pressure may be appropriate (ﬁg. 24). 
Regardless of the method, after packing the internal areas of the 
bearing, a small amount of grease also should be smeared on the 
outside of the rollers or balls.
The two primary considerations that determine the relubrication 
cycle are operating temperature and sealing efﬁciency. High- 
operating-temperature applications generally require more 
frequent regreasing. The less efﬁcient the seals, the greater 
the grease loss and the more frequently grease must be added. 
Grease should be added any time the amount in the bearing 
falls below the desired amount. The grease should be replaced

LUBRICATION
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  63
Prelubricated bearings
Prelubricated shielded and sealed bearings are successfully 
used in applications where:
 • Grease might be injurious to other parts of the 
mechanism.
 • Cost and space limitations preclude the use of a grease- 
ﬁlled housing.
 • Housings cannot be kept free of dirt and grit, water or other 
contaminants.
 • Relubrication is impossible or would be a hazard  
to satisfactory use.
Prelubricated bearings are pre-packed with greases that have 
chemical and mechanical stability, and they have demonstrated 
long-life characteristics in rotating bearings. Greases are 
ﬁltered several times to remove all harmful material, and they 
are accurately metered so that each bearing receives the proper 
amount of grease.
CONSISTENCY
Greases may vary in consistency from semi-ﬂuids that are hardly 
thicker than a viscous oil to solid grades almost as hard as a 
soft wood.
Consistency is measured by a penetrometer in which a standard 
weighted cone is dropped into the grease. The distance the cone 
penetrates (measured in tenths of a millimeter in a speciﬁc time) 
is the penetration number.
The National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) classiﬁcation 
of grease consistency is shown below:
TABLE 45. NLGI CLASSIFICATIONS
NLGI Grease Grades
Penetration Number

355-385

265-295
3
220-250
4
175-205
5
130-160
6
85-115
Grease consistency is not ﬁxed; it normally becomes softer 
when sheared or “worked.” In the laboratory, this “working” is 
accomplished by forcing a perforated plate up and down through 
a closed container of grease. This “working” does not compare 
with the violent shearing action that takes place in a bearing and 
does not necessarily correlate with actual performance.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
Timken offers the most extensive line of tapered roller 
bearings in the world. Tapered roller bearings consist of four 
interdependent components: the cone (inner ring), the cup 
(outer ring), the tapered rollers (rolling elements) and the 
cage (roller retainer). Tapered roller bearings are uniquely 
designed to manage both thrust and radial loads between a 
rotating and non-rotating member. The steeper the cup angle, 
the greater the ability of the bearing to handle thrust loads.
•  Sizes: 8 mm (0.315 in.) bore to 3000 mm (118 in.) 
outside diameter (O.D.).
• Industries: Aerospace, agriculture, automotive, heavy truck, 
cement, aggregate, coal, oil and gas, construction, gear 
drives, machine tools, mining, paper, metals, rail and wind.
•  Features: Available in single-, double- and four-row conﬁ gurations. 
Refer to www.timken.com for four-row information. Customized designs 
and features are available upon request. 
• Beneﬁ ts: Enhanced performance in demanding applications.

PART-NUMBERING SYSTEMS FOR RADIAL TAPERED 
ROLLER BEARINGS
HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR PART NUMBER
The part-numbering systems for single-row radial tapered roller bearings (type TS) are 
internationally recognized. Several part-numbering systems have been developed that can be 
classiﬁed according to metric or inch systems. Inch system bearings are normally assigned 
individual part numbers for the inner ring and for the outer ring, whereas ISO (metric) bearings 
are assigned a unique part number for the bearing assembly as a whole, which includes both 
inner and outer ring.
INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEMS
ORIGINAL INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEM
The original system developed by The Timken Company was 
based on a family of bearings designed around a common roller. 
Varying the number of rollers and the angle of the raceways 
allows different bearings to be designed for predominantly radial 
loads (shallow angle) or thrust loads (steep angle).
For example, all the tapered roller bearings in the 500 family use 
the same roller. However, the 595 Series has a steep angle and 24 
rollers while the 525 Series has a shallow angle and 15 rollers.
Individual part numbers are assigned to the inner and outer rings. 
Although there are exceptions, the general rule is that the outer 
ring has a part number that is lower than that of the inner ring.
NOTE: ISO 355 is a dimensional plan for metric tapered roller bearings. See page 72 for more details on ISO 355.
Fig. 25. Part-numbering standards.
BEARING SERIES
In all the part-numbering systems, the term bearing series is 
used to describe bearings having the same basic internal 
geometry (e.g. roller size, inner-ring and outer-ring angles). Any 
inner ring (including roller set) can be matched with any outer ring 
within the same series providing that the same type of bearing 
is being used.

ABMA INCH PART-NUMBERING SYSTEM
The current inch part-numbering system was developed by the 
American Bearing Manufacturers Association (ABMA) to address 
the expansion in the number of new applications and tapered 
roller-bearing designs. This part-numbering system has become 
the international standard for inch-sized bearings.
Section 1 - Series preﬁx
The series preﬁx consists of one or two letters that designate 
the duty class for which the bearing is designed. Additional 
preﬁx letters are available in table 49 on page 74.

The ABMA part-numbering system has been applied only to 
new bearing series designed after its introduction. Other part-
numbering systems also are in use including those based on 
the original numbering system and proprietary part numbers for 
special bearings. 
The ABMA part number is divided into ﬁve alphanumeric sections, 
which are described in ﬁg. 26.
Section 2 - Angularity designator
The ﬁrst digit following the preﬁx represents the angle coding as 
determined by the included angle of the outer ring.

J-PREFIX
A range of metric bearings originally designed by The Timken 
Company also were included in the ISO 355 plan. These bearings 
are speciﬁcally application-oriented and are designed for optimum 
performance. Depending on application and type of load, thrust 
and/or radial, the bearing with the optimum angle and section can 
be selected. For example, pinion bearings have a steep angle, 
whereas bearings for machine tools are generally designed with 
a shallow angle and a light section. Fig. 29 demonstrates this 
feature for 55 mm (2.1654 in.) bore bearings.
These bearings also are identiﬁed with a J-preﬁx, which indicates 
a metric dimensioned and toleranced bearing.

ISO 355 PART NUMBERING 
As dimensions given by the ISO 15 general plan were not found 
to be optimal for tapered roller bearings, ISO introduced a 
new numbering system for tapered roller bearings in ISO 355. 
The numbering system of ISO 355 uses three alphanumeric 
ﬁelds to deﬁne a dimension series. The bearing part number is 
then deﬁned by adding the inner-ring diameter in mm after the 
dimension series. Although the original metric part numbers were 
assigned a new designation in the ISO 355 plan, the original part 
number is still used.

BEARING ASSEMBLY NUMBERS
An assembly number is assigned on receipt of the ﬁrst order for 
new applications. It is very important for correct function of the 
bearing in a given application that the same assembly number is 
quoted for all subsequent orders. A Timken engineer should be 
consulted if additional information is required on the assembly 
number.
For further explanation of preﬁx and sufﬁx symbols or proprietary part numbers of special bearings, consult your Timken engineer.
The nomenclature for a bearing assembly consists of the inner-
ring part number followed by a ﬁve-digit alphanumeric code, e.g.

TYPE TSF
• Type TSF is a single-row bearing 
with a ﬂ ange on the outer ring. 
• The ﬂ ange is used for axial 
location in a housing. 
• Through-boring of the housing 
results in accurately aligned seats. 
• The ﬂ ange is not normally clamped in 
position. 
• Flanged outer rings can be used with any 
single inner ring from the same series. 
• The most commonly speciﬁ ed inner ring part numbers 
are shown in the tables provided. 
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal 
bearing selection to help ensure suitability, availability 
and the most cost-effective application.

• TSL is a single-row bearing 
with a DUO-FACE PLUS seal 
pressed on to the large rib of the 
inner ring.
• One lip of the DUO-FACE PLUS 
seal operates in the housing 
bore, the other lip seals against the 
hardened and ground surface of the 
outer-ring front face.
• This bearing provides an effective means to 
integrate a seal into grease-lubricated applications 
operating at moderate speeds.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal 
bearing selection to help ensure suitability, availability 
and the most cost-effective application.

TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  509
TYPE TDO
• TDO consists of a single-piece (double) 
outer ring and two single inner rings. 
• This conﬁ guration offers a wide 
effective bearing spread to support 
loads created by overturning moments.
• These bearings can be used at ﬁ xed 
positions or allowed to ﬂ oat in the housing 
bore to compensate for shaft expansion.
DOUBLE-OUTER RING CONFIGURATIONS
D
D sufﬁ x has a groove with oil holes for lubrication 
through the outer ring.
CD
CD sufﬁ x now replaces the DC sufﬁ x listed for 
part numbers in previous publications.
Same features as D sufﬁ x, but CD also has groove 
with oil holes. One lubrication hole is counterbored 
to accept an anti-rotational pin. 
Default conﬁ guration for most series.
• TDO bearings are usually supplied complete with an inner-ring 
spacer as a pre-set assembly.  

• To suit the application duty, the built-in setting value needs to be 
established by your Timken engineer before an order is placed.
• For spacer conﬁ guration information, contact your Timken 
engineer.
• Double outer ring can be used with any single inner ring from 
the same series.
• The tables list regularly speciﬁ ed inner-ring part numbers.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG  609
TYPE TDI
• TDI style consists of a single-piece 
(double) inner ring plus two single 
outer rings.
• It is normally supplied complete 
with an outer-ring spacer as a pre-set 
assembly.
• To suit the application duty, the built-
in setting value needs to be established 
by your Timken engineer before an order 
is placed.
• A groove and holes can be supplied in the outer-
ring spacer to allow lubricant to pass from the bearing 
housing. Contact your Timken engineer for spacer 
conﬁ guration information.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution. 
TYPE TDIT
• TDIT is a double inner-ring bearing with a tapered bore.
• It is comprised of a one-piece (double) inner ring and two 
single outer rings.
• TDIT bearings are typically supplied complete with an 
outer-ring spacer as a pre-set assembly. Contact your Timken 
engineer for spacer conﬁ guration information.
• These can be used in ﬁ xed (locating) positions on rotating-
shaft applications.
• The tapered inner-ring bore allows for easy removal where 
interference ﬁ ts are necessary and frequent removal of the 
bearing from the shaft is desired. 
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

TYPE TNA
• TNA bearings are non-adjustable, 
double-row bearings that are 
supplied with built-in clearance. 
This results in a speciﬁ ed mount-
ing setting range satisfactory for 
speciﬁ c applications.
• They are similar to type TDO, but the 
inner-ring front faces are extended so that 
they abut, which eliminates the need for the 
inner-ring spacer of a TDO bearing.
• They can be used at either ﬁ xed positions or allowed to ﬂ oat 
in the housing bore to compensate for shaft expansion.
DOUBLE-OUTER RING CONFIGURATIONS
D
D sufﬁ x has a groove with oil holes for lubrication 
through the outer ring.
CD
CD sufﬁ x now replaces the DC sufﬁ x listed for 
part numbers in previous publications.
Same features as D sufﬁ x, but CD also has groove 
with oil holes. One lubrication hole is counterbored 
to accept an anti-rotational pin. 
Default conﬁ guration for most series.
• For desired ﬁ tting practice and resultant mounted setting 
range information, contact your Timken engineer.
• If a closer control of mounted setting range is required, type 
TDO bearing assembly is recommended.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

TYPE TNASW AND 
TYPE TNASWE
• TNASW double-row bearings are a 
variant of type TNA, having chamfers 
and slots on the front face of the 
inner ring.
• TNASWE has an extended inner ring face.
• Slots on the inner ring provide lubrication.
• Cone front faces are extended, eliminating the 
need for a separate cone spacer. 
• TNASW and TNASWE bearings are supplied with a built-in 
clearance, which results in a speciﬁ ed mounted setting 
range satisfactory for most applications. 
• Types TNASW and TNASWE provide a solution for ﬁ xed 
or ﬂ oating bearing applications.
• Consult your Timken engineer before making a ﬁ nal bearing 
selection to help ensure suitability, availability and the most 
cost-effective solution.

• Any two matching single-row bearings (type TS) 
can be supplied as a double-row, pre-set, ready-to-ﬁ t
assembly by the addition of spacers, machined to 
pre-determined dimensions and tolerances. 
• There are two basic mounting arrangements 
for single-row spacer assemblies: 
2TS-DM
2TS-IM
SR
2S
• Type 2TS-IM (indirect mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings with  

an inner-ring and outer-ring spacer. In some  

applications, the outer-ring spacer is replaced  

by a shoulder in the bearing housing.
• Type 2TS-DM (direct mounting)

These consist of two single-row bearings, with 

cone (inner-ring) backfaces abutting and an  

outer-ring spacer. They are generally used  

at ﬁ xed (locating) positions on rotating shaft  

applications.
• Type 2S - Two single-row assembly
Supplied complete with inner-ring and outer-
ring spacers to give a pre-determined bearing 
setting when assembled. The setting range can 
be speciﬁ ed to suit the application. Type 2S has 
an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring, which also 
serves as the cup spacer, to give axial location in 
a through-bored housing.
• Type SR - Set-Right assembly
Type SR is made to a standard setting range, 
based on Timken’s Set-Right automated 
setting technique, suitable for most industrial 
applications. It is equipped with two spacers 
and an optional snap-ring that may be used 
for axial location.
• Along with the standard 2TS types, there are two 
specialty double-row assemblies available:

TAPERED ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
Overview: Timken® thrust bearings are built to handle high thrust loads and 
heavy shock. The distinctive on-apex design characteristic of tapered roller 
thrust bearings ensures true rolling motion, which reduces roller sliding and 
provides a smoother, cooler-running bearing than other thrust types. Available 
in a wide range of sizes and design styles, these bearings ﬁ t many types of

TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
734  TIMKEN TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CATALOG   
TAPERED ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
Timken tapered roller thrust bearings include conical rollers for true rolling motion. These 
bearings are engineered so that the rollers and raceway converge at a common apex point, 
which is on the center line of the bearing. Seating force between the rib and roller helps provide 
positive roller guidance. 
Timken manufactures several types of heavy-duty tapered roller thrust bearings: standard 
(TTHD), V-ﬂat (TTHDFL) and self-aligning V-ﬂat (TTVS). Timken also offers TTSP and TTC, light-
duty thrust bearings designed for oscillating applications.
TTHD
The TTHD design has an identical pair of hardened and ground steel rings with tapered raceways. 
Because both rings have the same bore and O.D., housings should be designed to clear the O.D. 
of rotating rings and shafts stepped to clear the bore of stationary rings. Controlled-contour 
tapered rollers are used and equally spaced by a cage. All components are separable. Most 
TTHD bearings are supplied with case-carburized components, which are well-suited for 
applications where extremely high thrust loads and heavy shock may be encountered. For very 
low-speed applications with unusually high loading, TTHD bearings can be supplied with a full 
complement of rollers. Extensively used in numerous applications, including oil well swivels, 
top drives, pulp reﬁners, extruders and gearboxes. Applications for full-complement bearings 
should be reviewed by your Timken engineer to help ensure selection of the proper bearing. 
TTHDFL
The TTHDFL combines the outstanding features of tapered and cylindrical roller bearings, offering 
the highest possible capacity of any thrust bearing of its size. The V-ﬂat design includes one 
ﬂat ring and one ring having a tapered raceway matching the rollers. These bearings maximize 
dynamic and static capacity within a given envelope. The design was originally developed for 
screwdown applications in metal rolling mills. They also have been highly successful in heavily 
loaded extruders, cone crushers, top drives and other applications where a wide range of 
operating conditions are found. Most sizes utilize pin-type cages with hardened pins through 
the center of the rollers, allowing closer spacing of the rollers to maximize capacity. Smaller 
sizes have brass cages designed for unidirectional retention of rollers.

TTVS
The TTVS design employs the same basic roller and raceway design as the TTHDFL, except 
the lower ring is in two pieces. The contacting faces of the lower ring are spherically ground, 
permitting self-alignment under conditions of initial misalignment. TTVS bearings should not 
be used if dynamic misalignment (changing under load) is expected. These bearings are found 
in cone crushers, extruders, gear drives and pulp reﬁners.
Fig. 36. Type TTVS.
Fig. 38. Type TTC.
Fig. 39. Type TTCS.
Fig. 40. Type TTCL.
TTSP
Type TTSP thrust bearing is made up of two tapered thrust races, 
rollers, cage and an outside retainer which holds the components 
together during shipping and installation. TTSP bearings are light-
duty thrust bearings and are used extensively in the steering pivot 
positions of automotive and other industrial applications.
TTC, TTCS, TTCL
The types TTC, TTCS and TTCL thrust bearings consist of two 
tapered thrust races, rollers, and an outside retainer, but do not 
have a cage. The outside retainer holds the assembly together for 
shipping and installation. Types TTC, TTCS and TTCL bearings are 
thrust bearings speciﬁcally designed for oscillating applications. 
The retainer construction varies between types.

Timken thrust bearings follow a unique part-numbering system 
with three main components. Since many thrust bearings are 
designed for a speciﬁc application it is common to use special 
part numbers.

AUXILIARY PARTS
Timken offers a wide range of auxiliary parts for 
use in the mounting of bearing products. Locknuts, 
lockwashers and shims may be used to help ensure 
the proper backing and setting of bearings in 
the application.

AUXILIARY PARTS
LOCKNUTS, LOCKWASHERS AND TONGUED WASHERS
The designs shown in ﬁgs. 43 to 48 show various methods of 
applying standard locknuts, lockwashers and tongued washers. 
A single locknut and lockwasher can be used to clamp the inner 
ring against a sleeve, shown in ﬁg. 43, or directly against a shaft 
shoulder. A narrow spacer is applied between the front face of the 
inner ring and the lockwasher so that the lockwasher will clear the 
bearing cage by a minimum of 3 mm (0.12 in.). The spacer outside 
diameter should be made a minimum of 6 mm (0.24 in.) smaller 
than the cage inside diameter, but must still provide the suggested 
inner ring backing diameter. Fig. 44 shows another clamped design 
using a single locknut and lockwasher with a double-row bearing 
of either type TDO with inner ring spacer or type TNA. Since no 
cage clearance problem is present, the narrow spacer shown in 
ﬁg. 43 is unnecessary.
Fig. 45, 46, and 47 indicate an adjustable bearing arrangement 
using two locknuts and a lockwasher. These may be used with 
either single- or double-row bearings of the types permitting an 
inner ring adjusted arrangement. The design in ﬁg. 45 allows 
the maximum shaft extension diameter that can be used with a 
shaft thread outside diameter, which will be less than the inner 
ring bore. Fig. 46 shows an alternate design with smaller thread 
diameter and corresponding smaller locknuts and lockwasher. 
The locknut outside diameter, minus two times r, must not be less 
than the suggested inner ring backing diameter. Fig. 47 indicates 
the use of a tongued washer located between the inner locknut 
and inner ring. This is intended for applications where the inner 
rings are applied with loose ﬁts on hardened stationary shafts as 
found in many automotive applications. The hardened tongued 
washers are not sold by The Timken Company.
When space does not permit the use of two locknuts and a 
lockwasher in an adjustable arrangement, and a single locknut 
and a lockwasher are used, then a tongued washer must be 
placed between the inner ring and lockwasher as illustrated in 
ﬁg. 48. This is necessary to provide adequate backing for the inner 
ring, in most cases, and to prevent damage to the lockwasher if 
the inner ring should creep on the shaft. The tongued washers 
are available from The Timken Company.
