Rolling Bearings Classifications
3
Rolling bearing construction
Most rolling bearings consist of rings with raceway (inner ring and outer ring), rolling elements (either balls or
rollers) and cage. The cage separates the rolling elements at regular intervals, holds them in place within the
inner and outer raceways, and allows them to rotate freely.
Classification of rolling bearings
Rolling bearings divide into two main classifications: ball bearings and roller bearings. Ball bearings are classified
according to their bearing ring configurations: deep groove type and angular contact type. Roller bearings on
the other hand are classified according to the shape of the rollers: cylindrical, needle, tapered and spherical.
Rolling bearings can be further classified according to the direction in which the load is applied; radial bearings
carry radial loads and thrust bearings carry axial loads.
Other classifications
1) Number of rolling rows (single, double, or 4-row),
2) Separable and non-separable, in which either the inner ring or the outer ring can be detached.
3) There are also bearings designed for special purposes, such as Automotive and other applications
Deep groove ball bearings
The most common type of bearing, deep groove ball bearings are widely used in
a variety of fields. Deep groove ball bearings include shield bearings and sealed
bearings with grease enabling easier usage. Deep groove ball bearings also
include bearings with a locating snap-ring to facilitate positioning when mounting
the outer ring. These type of bearings supports radial load on both directions. Deep
groove ball bearings are also classified into Thin series, Light series, Medium
series and Heavy series ball bearings.
Angular contact ball bearings
Angular contact ball bearings unite point of contact of the inner ring, ball and the
outer ring runs at a certain angle (contact angle) in the radial direction. Bearings
are generally designed with three contact angles. Angular contact ball bearings
can support an axial load, but cannot be used as single bearing because of the
contact angle. They must instead be used in pairs or in combinations. Angular
contact ball bearings include double row angular contact ball bearings for which
the inner and outer rings are combined as a single unit. The contact angle of
double row angular contact ball bearings is 25°. These type support certain
amount of combined loads.
Cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings use rollers for rolling elements, and therefore has a
high load capacity. The rollers are guided by the ribs of the inner or outer ring.
The inner and outer rings can be separated to facilitate assembly, and both can
be fitted with shaft or housing tightly. If there are no ribs, either the inner or the
outer ring can move freely in the axial direction. Cylindrical roller bearings are of
different types, like N, NU, NJ, NUP, NF depending upon the construction of inner
and outer rings. Cylindrical roller bearings are designed with multiple row rollers
and full compliment rollers without cage depending on the applications. These
bearings are suitable for heavy radial and impact loading and are appropriate for
high speed applications.

Tapered roller bearings
Tapper roller bearings are designed such that the outer ring, inner ring and the
rollers have tapered surfaces whose apexes converge at a common point on the
bearing axis. Tapper rollers are available in metric as well as inch dimensions most
commonly called as metric series and inch series . Tapper rollers are available in
Single, Double and four row, these type of bearings are suitable for Heavy and
Impact load application and can take both radial and axial load simultaneously.
Spherical roller bearings
Spherical roller bearings are equipped with an outer ring with a spherical raceway
surface and an inner ring which holds two rows of barrel shaped rolling elements,
spherical roller bearings are able to adjust center alignment to handle inclination
of the axle or shaft. There are varieties of bearing types that differ according
to internal design. Spherical roller bearings include as type equipped with an
inner ring with a tapered bore. The bearing can easily be mounted on a shaft by
means of an adapter or withdrawal sleeve. The bearing is capable of supporting
heavy loads, and is therefore often used in industrial machinery. Gages for these
bearings are of both steel and brass depending on the applications.
Thrust bearings
Thrust 	bearings 	are 	classified 	in 	accordance 	to
the rolling elements they contain and generally the
allowable rotational speed is very low.
Thrust ball bearing with single row is called as single
direction Thrust ball bearings and can take axial load
in one direction, whereas Thrust ball bearing with
double row is called as double direction Thrust ball
bearings and can take axial load from both directions.
Thrust bearings with rollers as rolling element can
accommodate a certain amount of radial load along
with axial loads.
Ball Bearing unit
A ball bearing unit is comprised of a ball bearing inserted into various types of housings. The housing can
be bolted onto machinery and the inner ring can be easily mounted on the shaft with a set screw. This
means the bearing unit can support rotating equipment without special design to allow for mounting. A variety
of standardized housing shapes is available, including pillow and flange types. The outer diameter of the
bearing is spherical just like the inner diameter of the housing, so it capable of aligning itself on the shaft. For
lubrication, grease is sealed inside the bearing, and particle penetration is prevented by a double seal with
3 lip

Bearing Designation, prefix and suffix
Rolling bearing part numbers indicate bearing type, dimensions, tolerances, internal construction, and other
related specifications. Bearing numbers are comprised of a “basic number” followed by “supplementary codes.”
The basic number indicates general information about a bearing, such as its fundamental type, boundary
dimensions, series number, bore diameter code and contact angle. The supplementary codes derive from
prefixes and suffixes which indicate a bearing’s tolerance, internal clearance, and related specifications.

Bearings Tolerances
9
Tolerances for bearings
Bearing tolerances and permissible values for the boundary dimensions and running accuracy of bearings are
specified. These values are prescribed in JIS B 1514 “tolerances for rolling bearings.” (These JIS standards
are based on ISO standards.)
Bearing tolerances are standardized by classifying bearings into the following six classes (accuracy in
tolerances becomes higher in the order described): 0, 6X, 6, 5, 4 and 2.
Dimensional accuracy
Dimensional accuracy constitutes the acceptable values for bore diameter, outer diameter, assembled
bearing width, and bore diameter uniformity as seen in chamfer dimensions, allowable inner ring tapered
bore deviation and shape error. Also included are, average bore diameter variation, outer diameter variation,
average outer diameter unevenness, as well as raceway width and height variation (for thrust bearings).
Running accuracy
Running accuracy constitutes the acceptable values for inner and outer ring radial runout and axial runout,
inner ring side runout, and outer ring outer diameter runout. Allowable rolling bearing tolerances have been
established according to precision classes. Bearing precision is stipulated as JIS class 6, class 5, class 4, or
class 2, with precision rising from ordinary precision indicated by class 0.

Bearings Fits
16
Bearings Fits
Interference
For rolling bearings, inner and outer rings are fixed on the shaft or in the housing so that relative movement
does not occur between fitting surfaces during operation or under load. This relative movement between the
fitting surfaces of the bearing and the shaft or housing can occur in a radial direction, an axial direction, or
in the direction of rotation. Types of fitting include tight, transition and loose fitting, which may be selected
depending on whether or not there is interference.
The most effective way to fix the fitting surfaces between a bearing’s raceway and shaft or housing is to
apply a “tight fit.” The advantage of this tight fit for thin walled bearings is that it provides uniform load support
over the entire ring circumference without any loss of load carrying capacity. However, with a tight fit, ease
of installation and disassembly is lost; and when using a non-separable bearing as the floating-side bearing,
axial displacement is not possible. For this reason, a tight fit cannot be recommended in all cases.
The necessity of a proper fit
In some cases, improper fit may lead to damage and shorten bearing life, therefore it is necessary to make
a careful investigation in selecting a proper fit. Some of the bearing failure caused by improper fit are listed
below.
• Raceway cracking, early flaking and displacement of raceway
• Raceway and shaft or housing abrasion caused by creeping and fretting corrosion
• Seizing caused by negative internal clearances
• Increased noise and deteriorated rotational accuracy due to raceway groove deformation
Fit selection
Selection of a proper fit is dependent upon thorough analysis of bearing operating conditions, including
consideration of:
• Shaft and housing material, wall thickness, finished surface accuracy, etc.
• Machinery operating conditions (nature and magnitude of load, rotational speed, temperature, etc.)
“Tight fit” or “Loose fit”
(1) For raceways under rotating loads, a tight fit is necessary. “Raceways under rotating loads” refers to
raceways receiving loads rotating relative to their radial direction. For raceways under static loads, on the
other hand, a loose fit is sufficient.
(2) For non-separable bearings, such as deep groove ball bearings, it is generally recommended that either
the inner ring or outer ring be given a loose fit.

Recommended Fits
Bearing fit is governed by the selection tolerances for bearing shaft diameters and housing bore diameters.
Widely used fits for 0 Class tolerance bearings and various shaft and housing bore diameter tolerances are
shown below.
Interference minimum and maximum values
The following points should be considered when it is necessary to calculate the interference for an
application:
• In calculating the minimum required amount of interference keep in mind that:
1) interference is reduced by radial loads
2) interference is reduced by differences between bearing temperature and ambient temperature
3) interference is reduced by variation of fitting surfaces
• The upper limit value should not exceed 1/1000 of the shaft diameter.

Bearing Internal Clearance
22
Bearing Internal Clearance
Bearing internal clearance
Bearing internal clearance is the amount of internal free movement before mounting.
As shown below, when either the inner ring or the outer ring is fixed and the other ring is free to move,
displacement can take place in either an axial or radial direction. This amount of displacement (radially or
axially) is termed the internal clearance and, depending on the direction, is called the radial internal clearance
or the axial internal clearance.
When the internal clearance of a bearing is measured, a slight measurement load is applied to the raceway
so the internal clearance may be measured accurately. However, at this time, a slight amount of elastic
deformation of the bearing occurs under the measurement load, and the clearance measurement value
(measured clearance) is slightly larger than the true clearance. This difference between the true bearing
clearance and the increased amount due to the elastic deformation must be compensated for. These
compensation values are given in Table below.
Internal clearance selection
The internal clearance of a bearing under operating conditions (effective clearance) is usually smaller than the
same bearing’s initial clearance before being installed and operated. This is due to several factors including
bearing fit, the difference in temperature between the inner and outer rings, etc. As a bearing’s operating
clearance has an effect on bearing life, heat generation, vibration, noise, etc.; care must be taken in selecting
the most suitable operating clearance.
Criteria for selecting bearing internal clearance
A bearing’s life is theoretically maximum when operating clearance is slightly negative at steady operation. In
reality it is however difficult to constantly maintain this optimal condition. If the negative clearance becomes
enlarged by fluctuating operating conditions, heat will be produced and life will decrease dramatically. Under
ordinary circumstances you should therefore select an initial internal clearance where the operating clearance
is slightly larger than zero.
For ordinary operating conditions, use fitting for ordinary loads. If rotational speed and operating temperature
are ordinary, selecting normal clearance enables you to obtain the proper operating clearance. Table below
gives examples applying internal clearances other than CN (normal) clearance.

Bearing Lubrication
27
Bearing Lubrication
Proper lubrication for rolling element bearings is critical for reliable bearing operation and prevention of
premature damage and a reduction in fatigue life. The proper bearing lubricant must provide a separating film
between the rolling elements, raceways, and cage to prevent metal-to-metal contact. The lubricant film must
be thick enough under operating conditions to prevent contact of rolling element and raceway asperities.
If the asperities of rolling elements and races of an anti-friction bearing come into contact with each other,
a certain amount of molecular adhesion or micro-welding or shearing of these asperities as a result of the
relative motion between them can be expected. The result is an undesirable surface change of the rolling
surfaces. Ideal lubrication requires that an oil film be continually present to prevent contact of the surface
asperities and metal to metal contact.
In addition to preventing metal-to-metal contact, proper bearing lubricants help perform the following
function:
• Reduce friction, heat generation, torque, and power consumption
• Provide a heat transfer medium
• Prevent corrosion
• Aid in providing proper sealing and preventing contamination
Bearing lubrication is broadly categorized as being either grease or oil lubrication. The decision to use grease or oil
and what type of lubricant system to use, are dependent on the bearing type and application operating conditions.
Bearing greasing methods and amounts
There are two methods of providing bearing grease lubrication. One is the closed lubrication, in which grease
is filed in advance into a shielded or sealed bearing; the other is the feeding method in which the bearing and
housing are greased at assembly with the proper amount and designed to allow re-greasing and replacement
at specified intervals. The dosed method using a pre-lubricated shielded or sealed bearing is well suited for
applications where cost and space limitations preclude the use of grease filled housing or where relubrication
is not possible or necessary. Conversely, the use of the feeding method has the advantage of allowing
the replacement on periodic intervals in those applications where operating conditions require grease
replacement.
For bearing applications utilizing the feeding method, there should be a grease fitting and a vent at opposite
ends of the housing near the top. Also, a drain plug should be located near the bottom of the housing to allow
purging of the old grease during relubrication. A bearing should be initially greased at assembly by packing
it in on both sides and making sure the grease is between the rolling elements and cage. Regreasing should
always occur while the bearing is in motion at the normal operating temperature.
Grease amount
The amount of grease needed to effectively lubricate a bearing is normally very small. In general, grease
fill should be one-third to one-half of the space around the bearing; however, this may vary according to the
housing design and application requirements. In applications with high speed and low torque requirements,
the bearings can be lubricated with very small quantities of greases. Similarly, in low speed applications
where the bearing may be exposed to dirt or moisture, the space around the bearing can be filled from two-
thirds to nearly full to prevent contamination. If an excessive amount of grease is used when not required,
additional heat will be generated from the churning, resulting in a softening and deterioration of the grease,
and a reduction in bearing life. The grease weight required for a bearing can be calculated in grams.
Grease quantity = 0.05 x D x B gms.
Regreasing intervals and grease life
With grease lubricated bearings, periodic relubrication is normally required to ensure efficient operation.
Over a period of time, most grease will eventually start to harden due to oxidation. The exception to this is in
presealed bearings where relubrication is usually not required.
When regreasing bearings, it is necessary to be sure that the grease fitting is clean prior to injecting the
grease. A hand operated grease gun should be used for relubrication, but the use of high pressure needs
to be avoided. High pressure may blow out seals. When using a grease gun, it should be calibrated for the

28
proper amount of grease, and confirmed that the grease in the gun is the same as what was initially applied
to the bearings.
The main considerations for determining a relubrication cycle are operating speed, bearing size, operating
temperature, and sealing efficiency. Seals are very critical with grease lubrication because of the importance
to keep the grease free from contamination. Contamination that reaches the grease is trapped and will cause
bearing damage and wear problems.
