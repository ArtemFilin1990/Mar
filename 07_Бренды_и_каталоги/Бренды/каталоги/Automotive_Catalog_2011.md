/ Fersa history
Currently, 90% of our turnover comes from exports to 
more than 60 countries on various continents.
The history of Fersa Bearings goes back to 1968, when two family-owned businesses 
joined forces to create A&S Fersa. As the company acquired international recognition, 
the name was changed to Fersa Bearing S.A., as it is known today. 
Key to the success enjoyed since its beginnings has been the professional 
experience and technical know-how of the entire staff (from R&D through sales), as 
well as the shareholders determination to continuously invest in people and capital, 
in order to modernize all areas of the company.  
Every product offered in our broad product line, be it for industrial, heavy vehicles

General fundamentals
01. General fundamentals
Bearings are vital machine components designed to allow rotation between two elements of a mechanism. They must 
be able to sustain the load coming from their own weight, and gear actions, belts, chains, etc., with minimum friction.
A bearing is generally composed of:
- Two rings, one linked to the fixed element, the other fitted to the mobile element, enabling rolling motion.
- Assembly of rolling elements, balls or rollers, that allow the displacement between the two rings.
- A cage maintaining separately the rolling elements.
A bearing can be classified in two main families:
- Those with punctual contact between rolling elements and rings, called ball bearings.
- Those with linear contact, called roller bearings.

Dimensioning of wheel bearing units
03. Dimensioning of wheel bearing units
Driving loads must be carried by the rolling elements (contact surface between raceway and rolling element). Due to this 
fact, the dimensions of the rows as well as of rolling elements are relevant for the bearing lifetime.
The driving conditions, i.e. number of cycles, rotation speeds, curvature ratio, impact factor, time ratio [%] are crucial for 
lifetime calculation. Application data as axle load, bearing offset, dynamic radius, adjustment, etc must also be taken into 
consideration for lifetime calculation.
The fL- value is used to help selecting the correct bearing size. It comes from the ISO standard formula for lifetime and is 
used to compare new bearing designs to well-proven and already defined types.
The fL- value is a non dimensional value and is meant to embrace different influences as wheel loads, numbers of revo-
lutions, temperatures, environmental conditions, lubrication, cleanliness in the bearing, etc.

General information
The rolling elements of a ball bearing touch the raceways at one point. The connecting line of these points runs along the 
raceways and goes through the center of the rolling element. Along this line an externally applied load will be transmitted 
from one bearing ring to the other. This line is therefore named the contact line of the bearing. The contact angle α is 
made by this line and the radial plane.
• 	Nominal contact angle a0: is measured during the unloaded bearing condition, in which the balls are not in stress 
contact with the raceways.
• 	Operating contact angle a: the contact angle in the bearing, which takes into consideration external influences as 
loads and adjustment.
The contact angle projected on the bearing axis forms an effective bearing spread. The bigger the effective bearing 
spread, the torque generated by the loads which can be withheld by cornering is increased.
For direct driving conditions a low contact angle leads to the longest lifetime. However this is very unfavorable for cor-
nering.
An increased contact angle leads to the longest lifetime and a strong cornering load, but it decreases the theoretical 
fatigue running time for travelling straight ahead. The optimal contact angle depends on the driving conditions.
3.3 - Contact angle

36
If the curvature ratio is restricted i.e. the raceway radius approaches the ball radius, a slipping effect on the contact sur-
face will appear, because the ball only runs off in two points of the contact area on the outer and inner rings and drifts 
forwards/backwards on the rest of raceway area. However the contact pressure is distributed on a large part of the 
raceway during a light osculation.
On the other hand, if the curvature ratio is too big, the balls run off without the slipping effect. However, the maximum 
contact pressure will be higher, since the contact area of the contact ellipse becomes smaller.
03. Dimensioning of Wheel Bearing Units
For bearings with curved raceway and rolling elements, the radius of the raceway profile is slightly larger than the radius 
of the rolling element. This curvature difference is defined by the parameter k:
Fitting tolerances
Housings:
The tolerance zone is defined as a spherical zone limited by the upper and lower limit dimensions of the part. The tole-
rance zone is therefore determined by the amount of tolerance and its position related to the basic size. The position of 
the tolerance zone, related to the basic size (zero line), is determined in the ISO system by a so-called basic deviation. 
The ISO system defines 28 classes of basic deviations for the holes. These classes are marked by capital letters (A, B, C 
... ZC). The tolerance zone for the specified dimensions in the drawing is indicated by a tolerance mark, which consists 
of a letter marking of the basic deviation and a numerical marking of the tolerance grade (e.g. H7, H8, D5, etc.).

Shafts:
The tolerance zone is defined as a spherical zone limited by the upper and lower limit dimensions of the parts. The tole-
rance zone is therefore determined by the amount of tolerance and its position related to the basic size. The position of 
the tolerance zone, related to the basic size (zero line), is determined in the ISO system by a so-called basic deviation. 
The ISO system defines 28 classes of basic deviations for the shafts. These classes are marked by lower case letters 
(a, b, c... zc). The tolerance zone for the specified dimensions in the drawing is indicated by a tolerance mark, which 
consists of a letter marking of the basic deviation and a numerical marking of the tolerance grade (e.g. h7, h6, g5, etc.).
Bearings must be fixed on the axle and also in the housing in radial, axial and circumferential directions. Radial and cir-
cumferential adjustments are achieved by tightly fitting the rings of the bearing. Axial location can partially be achieved 
by ensuring a tight fit.
It is necessary to take into consideration the following requirements when selecting the correct fitting:
• 	Bearings must be mounted accordingly and supported over their circumference in order to optimize the load-
carrying capacity.
• 	Sliding between surfaces in a circumferential direction is not allowed in order to prevent damaging.
• 	Bearing must have axial latitude to adjust length variations of shaft and housing.
• 	Correct assembly and disassembly.
The tolerance is the difference which can be tolerated or admitted between the nominal value and the real or effective 
value in the physical and chemical characteristics of a material, piece or product.
The measuring unit for tolerances is the micron (µm).

General information
The preload serves to provide a minimum load on the bearing and prevent bearing damage as a result of sliding move-
ments of the rolling elements. 
The main reasons to apply bearing preload are to: 
- 	Enhance stiffness
- 	Reduce running noise
-	 Enhance the accuracy of shaft guidance
- 	Compensate for wear and settling (bedding down) processes in operation
- 	Provide long service life 
3.7 - Pre-load
Interference generated by adjustment in F-One designs (double row tapered roller bearings and double row ball bearings) 
has a significant influence in Axial Clearance / Pre-Load relations.
In this kind of bearings there are 2 contact surfaces: one between the housing and outer ring and another between the 
shaft and inner rings. This interference generates a bearing elastic deformation, which narrows the axial clearance defi-
ned in the drawing.
In addition to the adjustment, the mounting torque (applied on the nut) will usually convert the initial axial clearance into 
a pre-load after assembly. 	
For F-Two designs there is only one contact surface (between shaft and inner rings), which makes the axial clearance 
specified in the drawing smaller than the clearance of F-One designs. The mounting torque is also required for this kind 
of bearings in order to define the final pre-load.
F-Three is the Fersa design with the highest integration level and the pre-load is already defined from the production 
process. Due to this fact, there is a very low variation of the pre-load (insensitivity). This design avoids mistakes by setting 
the pre-load during the assembly.

03. Dimensioning of wheel bearing units
Wheel bearings usually achieve their longest lifetime performance in operation under pre-load. Except for Fersa F-Three 
where the pre-load is already set, the pre-load of other wheel bearing designs have to be set during assembly.
A significant part of this setting is the fit influence. Tolerances of the bearing rings and also tolerances from the housing 
and shaft should be taken into consideration during mounting in order to reach the theoretical pre-load described in the 
drawing.
After the mounting it is mandatory to apply the corresponding mounting torque with a nut (specified by the vehicle ma-
nufacturer). With this procedure the bearing should operate in its best condition

Antilock-brake system (ABS)
04. Antilock-Brake System (ABS)
With the evolution of automotive technology, safety has become a fundamental requirement. For reasons of both safety 
and driving comfort, more and more vehicles are being equipped with speed sensing devices (primarily sensors that 
provide a signal system with the wheel speed information). The optimum wheel speed sensor solution is unique for each 
individual application. Due to this fact, the Antilock Brake System (ABS) has become globally used in the automotive 
sector, ensuring safe braking on slippery and icy roads. 
ABS functions to prevent individual wheel lockup. It helps the driver, by providing steering control, in order to keep control 
of vehicle in case of emergency. Since a locked up wheel cannot be steered, the ABS permits the driver to control the 
vehicle even during strong pumping of the brake pedal and it reports active data used to control decisions as a reaction 
to changing of road conditions.
4.2 - Passive encoder
Passive axial encoder
Passive radial encoder
A passive encoder is generally a metallic impulse ring and it rotates at the same speed of the wheel. The sensor should 
be mounted nearby the impulse ring. Apart of getting a signal from the impulse ring, a sensor should transfer it to the 
Electronic Control Unit (ECU), in order to control the brake force. It is not mandatory that an impulse ring should be 
assembled on the bearing. It can be mounted on rotating components, which belong to the wheel system as CV-Joint, 
drive shaft, etc.

General information
Passive sensor
Active sensor
4.4 - Sensors
By applying an active sensor, the multi-pole encoder permits a regular output. For this reason, the encoder can recognize 
wheel rotation speed, even when running at a very low speed. Active sensor do not require magnets, reducing cost and 
weight.
Depending on vehicle requirements and design, the sensors are defined as non-integrated and integrated designs. The 
non-integrated design is used in the most ordinary applications and the integrated design is used when weight and 
assembly time saving are needed. 
There are two types of sensors: passive and active. The passive sensors can provide a signal at low speed, which would 
be enough for the operation of a vehicle equipped with ABS. The active sensors can provide signal at speed zero, which 
is needed for systems such as navigation and traction control.
Independently of the solution, sensor integration would offer:
• Reduction of assembly time
• Reliability improvement
• Reduction of space requirements
• Weight reduction
Active sensor + multi-pole encoder
4.3 - Multi-pole encoder
This system uses a magnetic ring, in place of a conventional metallic impulse ring. The magnetic sensor (active sensor) 
mounted on the vehicle is able to detect rotation speed of the wheel. The multi-pole encoder can be designed in both 
radial and axial direction.

Lubrication
05. Lubrication
Approximately 45% of bearing failure and breakdowns are due to inadequate or insufficient lubrication, hence why lubri-
cation is such an important aspect of the bearing.
The main function of a lubricant is to allow for the correct rotation a movement between the various rolling elements of a 
bearing, reducing friction between the contact surfaces and therefore reducing damages. 
Lubrication inhibits contamination, avoids impurities, improves sealing and protects against corrosion. The main purpose 
of the lubrication process is to prolong the service life and optimal performance of the bearing for as long as possible. 
Today there is an increasing concern for the effect that lubricants may have on the environment. Recently Fersa has co-
llaborated, together with other companies and technological centers, with the CRAFT project of “the BIOMON European 
Commission, towards long life bio-lubricants, using advanced design and monitoring tools”, whose main objective has 
been the development of bio-degradable lubricants which are to be used in different mechanical industrial applications.
5.1 - Introduction

General information
To lubricate is to apply a layer of lubricant between the raceways and the rolling elements. This keeps the different 
contact surfaces separate and prevents direct metal-to-metal contact between them. 
The choice of lubricant depends on several factors:
- 	Viscosity of the lubricant.
- 	Geometric conditions of the rolling elements (the superficial texture is especially important).
- 	Environmental conditions (temperature, vibrations…), as well as the presence of foreign particles and contamina-
tion. 
- 	Working conditions (rotation speeds, loads, mounting, fatigue…).
All of the above are determining factors when selecting the best lubricant and best application process (amount, cle-
aning, re-lubrication intervals…) for the specific bearing. Depending on the lubrication applied, different lubrication situa-
tions can occur:
5.2 - Types of lubrication
5.2.1 - Total or hydrodynamic lubrication (pic. 1):
The surfaces of the elements implicated in the rotation 
are totally separated by the lubricant film in place.  This 
is the ideal lubrication situation, since there is no wear 
between surfaces and the friction rate is very low.
5.2.2 - Partial lubrication (pic. 2):
This is the true lubrication scenario, since there are some 
areas in contact despite the existing layer of lubricant.
5.2.3 - Lubrication by boundary layer (pic. 3):
When the amount of lubricant is insufficient or the relative 
movement too slow, the layer is thinner and cannot pre-
vent metal-to-metal contact; which causes more friction 
and generates more heat, which in turn increases the 
temperature and further reduces the layer of lubricant 
protection available. 
To prevent this, additives are used in the lubricant.  The-
se additives react with the metal parts and generate a 
boundary layer that reinforces the lubricant protection. 
5.2.4 - Solid lubrication:
For less severe working conditions, there are different ty-
pes of solid lubricants (graphite, lithium grease…) to help 
improve lubrication that prevents direct metal-to-metal 
contact between surfaces.

5.3 - Types of lubricants
There are two main lubrication options to choose from, grease or oil:
5.3.1 - Grease
Grease is the most widely used type of lubricant:
- 	Simpler design and more economical lubrication system.
- 	Less maintenance needed (there is a life lubrication option available).
- 	Good tightness and low contamination risk (cleaning).
Grease lubrication provides a high safety level at low speeds. They are oil based (mineral, silicon, ester) mixed with li-
thium, sodium or calcium soap thickener for density (sometimes salt from the metal soap is added to form a thickening 
complex). Polyurea, Teflon or bentonite can be used instead of soap. 
When selecting grease, the consistency, temperature range and corrosion resistance, miscibility, mechanical stability, 
rate of fluidity, etc., determine its suitability to perform under different conditions and work requirements (load carrying 
ability, speed, temperature, vibrations, etc.). The following table shows detailed information of the capacities of the diffe-
rent greases:
5.3.2 - Lubrication processes-grease
Under not very severe working conditions, there is a life lubrication option that also uses seals to help keep the lubricant 
inside in the bearings (especially where high vibrations and temperatures are concerned). However, under more severe 
conditions re-lubrication is necessary. Also the bearing must be greased once it is mounted, before being operative (re-
duces contamination risk) and should have been cleaned before greasing if not new. The amount of grease should not 
be excessive (possible engine size-up), nor should it be insufficient (damage to bearing).
The amount of grease should range approximately between 20 to 35% of the empty space in the bearing. The bearing 
should be fully rotated so that it is totally immersed in grease.

5.3.3 - Oils
Oil lubrication is used in 10% of bearing applications.
- 	Good performance at high speeds and heavy loads.
- 	Better ability for heat dissipation.
- 	More precise and efficient cleaning of particles.
- 	Possibility of recycling oil to lubricate other bearing elements (cost reduction).
- 	Easy monitoring of lubricant (condition and level).
The following oils are used on bearing applications:
• 	Minerals (most often used).
• 	Synthetics (used for specific applications): polyolefin, polyglycol, ester, oil fluorides, silicon oils…
When selecting an oil with the correct viscosity; temperature range, speed and load to be carried must be taken into 
account. The following table shows detailed information of the different oils and their specifications:

An oil lubricant should be chosen according to the required viscosity in order to guarantee an adequate lubrication in 
relation to the working temperature.
The time lapse from functioning to fatigue and protection from wear is best when the contact surfaces are well separa-
ted by the lubricant. Because the thickness of the lubricant layer increases with the oil viscosity, in theory oil with high 
viscosity should be chosen for the application. However, as the viscosity increases so does the friction of the lubricant, 
so the oil lubricant chosen should have enough viscosity to sustain the fatigue, while at the same time providing enough 
oil lubrication for the bearings.
There is a certain K relation between the viscosity (v) of the selected oil to the temperature when the bearing is functio-
ning, and the necessary cinematic speed v1 for a satisfactory lubrication.

05. Lubrication
• 	Oil circulation: Oil is brought to the bearing from a deposit by a system of pumps, tubes and valves.  The bearing 
should be lubricated before being operative and the amount of oil depends on the working conditions and the size 
of the bearing (more or less, between 0, 5 and 50 l/m). This procedure in combination with the oil bath greatly im-
proves the bearing´s features.

5.3.4 - Lubrication processes-oil
If an excessive amount of oil is used, the cooling level is good, but friction increases. For this situation there are different 
lubrication systems:
• 	Oil bath or immersion: A simple method for low speeds. When not moving, the bath should cover half of the lower 
part of the rolling element, so that when it rotates the oil is distributed on all of the parts. The oil level should be 
checked periodically and replaced according to contamination and wear (especially when temperatures are high 
and if oxygen and abrasives are present). This should be done every two months.

---

53
General information
• 	Injection of oil: at high speed (at least 15 m/s). It is advisable to inject the oil in the direction of the bearing. 
Injection of oil
Lubrication by dripping
With small quantities of oil (10 mg / h), using a lubrication system through a drip, oil mist or transported through the air, 
which results in a more precise lubrication, therefore forming a film between the contact surfaces which decreases the 
friction and maintains a low temperature.

06. Sealing
6.1 - Definition
Given certain applications, the mounted bearings must be protected with sealing mechanisms. These mechanisms must 
carry out two basic functions:
• Prevent external dirt or humidity from entering.
• Prevent lubricants from leaking out. 
The service life of the bearings very often depends on the efficiency of these mechanisms. The sealing mechanisms may 
vary a lot, and various factors must be considered when choosing the one to be applied:
• Type of lubricant (oil or grease).
• Rotation speed.
• Available space.
• Seal friction.
• Cost, etc.
Concerning the sealing function, if the two mechanical parts between which the leakage is likely to occur are fixed with 
relation to each other, the seal is called a static seal. If one or both of these parts are moving relative to the other, the seal 
is called a dynamic seal.
Many different methods have been or are still used for sealing, such as:
- With contact	
- Contactless
	 • Felt rings	
	 • Oil grooves
	 • Oil lip seals	
	 • Deflecting ring

	 • Labyrinth glands

Outside the box
Labyrinth
Lid
•	 Installed inside the box: the lubricant is introduced through a pump preventing leaks.
•	 Installed outside the box: prevents the entry of foreign materials into the housing.
•	 Type of cover: it removes the dirt by a centrifugal force.
•	 Forms a labyrinth with the box: the lubricant is introduced through a pump, prevent-
ing leaks.
Types
Oil grooves
-	 Oil grooves in shafts, housing or both. They can 
have a helicoidal shape (applications with only one 
direction of shaft rotation) so that they can function 
as lubrication pumps.
- 	Particularly well suited in cases of low grease and 
low speed.
-	 The space between the shaft and housing should 
be as small as possible.

O shaft < 50 mm → 0, 25 – 0, 4 mm.

O shaft > 50 mm → 0, 5- 1 mm.
-	 Width: 2-5 mm / Depth: 4-5 mm.
-	 They are frequently used in combination with other 
sealing elements. Performance can be improved if 
filled with groove grease.
