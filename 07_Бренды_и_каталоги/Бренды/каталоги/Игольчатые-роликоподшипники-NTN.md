their volume. Also, because the inertial force action on
them is limited, they are ideal choice for oscillating
motion. Needle roller bearings contribute to compact and
lightweight machine designs. They serve also as a ready
replacement for sliding bearings.
NTN offers the following types of needle roller bearings.
Needle roller bearings have relatively smaller diameter
cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger
than their diameter.
Compared with other types of rolling bearings, needle
roller bearings have a small cross-sectional height and
significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to
1.  Classification and Characteristics Bearings
This assembly, a major component of a needle roller bearing, comprising needle rollers and a cage to support the
rollers, is used typically for connecting rods in reciprocating compressors and small- and mid-sized internal combustion
engines such as those for motorbikes, light cars, outboard motors and versatile engines. This assembly features such a
cage that is specifically optimized for severe operating conditions involving high impact loads, complicated motions, high-
speed revolution and/or high operating temperatures.
This assembly, a major component of a
needle roller bearing, comprises needle rollers
and a cage to support the rollers.
¡Using the shaft and housing as raceway
surfaces reduces the cross-sectional
height: it is equal to the diameter of the
needle roller bearing.
¡This structure eliminating the outer and
inner rings allows the bearing to be fitted
more easily.
¡The assembly is available in both single-row
and double-row configurations.
¡As long as the tolerance limit of the shaft
and housing is satisfied, the radial internal
clearance can be made adjustable.
Needle roller and cage assembly
Needle roller and cage assembly for connecting rods
Needle roller and cage assembly for large end
¡This assembly, subjected to a cranking motion with a
simultaneous action of the rolling elements’ rotation
and revolution, must be light but have a high rigidity,
and must have a precise dimension of the outer
diameter of the cage so that the guiding system can
keep an appropriate gap.
¡The cage is made of high-tensile special steel with a
surface hardening treatment.
¡The guiding system employed is an outer diameter
guiding system.
¡The cage that may be subjected to poor lubrication
can be protected with a surface treatment using a
non-ferrous metal.
¡For applications with a one-piece structure of crank
shaft, the cage of split type is also available.

Classification and Characteristics of Bearings

¡Strong impact load acts on this bearing and it
oscillates at high speed. Therefore, the cage bore
surface is finished with high precision so as to secure
lightweight, high rigidity and proper guide clearance.
¡The cage is made of high tensile special steel and its
surface is hardened ideally.  
¡The cage is of bore guide type and the guide surface
is designed as long as possible to thereby reduce the
surface pressure. 
¡The roller length is designed to the possible
maximum value against the connecting width and a
number of small-size needle rollers are fitted in the
cage to minimize the contact pressure.
This bearing comprises an outer ring and needle
rollers, which were both drawn from special thin steel
plate by precision deep drawing, and a cage intended
to guide precisely the needle rollers. 
¡This bearing is the type of the lowest section height,
of the rolling bearings with outer ring, best-suited to
space-saving design.
¡A hardened and ground shaft or inner ring (IR Series)
is used as the raceway.
¡This bearing needs no axial locking due to easy
installation and press-fit in the housing. 
¡The close end type to close shaft end is available in
addition to the open end type. 
¡Furthermore, the type with seal fitted in at single side
or double sides is also available.
¡The standard type comprises a needle roller and
cage assembly. In addition to this type, special type
comprising full complement rollers is available at
option.
This bearing type comprises a machined outer ring
and machined needle rollers, and a cage to guide
properly the needle rollers. 
In the case of this bearing, the cage or the needle
rollers are guided by the ribs of the outer ring or the
face ring. Hence, this bearing is non-separable type. In
addition, the type with no inner ring is also available for
enabling a shaft to be used as the raceway surface. (Of
course, the type with inner ring is available.)  
¡Selectively available for both of the metric system
and the inch system.  
¡Best-suited to space-saving design due to its low
section height, then having the large load capacity. 
¡High rigidity and high bearing accuracy due to its
machined (precut) outer ring  
¡can be used with a housing made of light metal, etc.
due to its outer ring of high rigidity. 
¡Outer ring with lubrication hole and lubrication groove 
¡Single row and double row types available.  
¡The type with seal fitted in at single side or double
sides is also available.

Machined-ring needle roller bearing  separable type
Clearance-adjustable needle roller bearing
Inner ring
This bearing type comprises a machined outer ring
and machined needle rollers, and a cage to guide and
retain properly the needle rollers. And the needle roller
and cage assembly is separable from the outer ring. In
addition to the standard type, the type with no inner ring
is also available for enabling a shaft to be used as
direct raceway surface. (Of course, the type with inner
ring available, too.) 
¡Easy to install, ― the needle roller and cage
assembly, the outer ring, and the inner ring can be
mounted independently from each other.  
¡Any optional radial internal clearance is selectable by
combining the individual independent components. 
¡Best-suited to space-saving design due to its low
section height, then having the large load capacity. 
¡High rigidity and high bearing accuracy due to its
machined (precut) outer ring.
¡Can be used with a housing made of light metal, etc.
due to its outer ring of high rigidity. 
¡Single row and double row types available. And the
outer ring of the double row bearing is provided with
lubrication hole and lubrication groove.
For the needle roller bearings, usually a shaft is used
as the raceway surface, but this inner ring is used
where the shaft surface can not be machined to the
specific hardness and roughness.  This inner ring is

axial pressing load and thereby changing shrinkage
of the outer ring raceway diameter. 
¡This bearing is applied to the work spindle of a
machine tool and other similar portions which require
the high speed rotational accuracy of JIS Grade-4.

2.  Load Rating and Life
2.1  Bearing life
Even when bearings are in running under normal
condition, the raceway surface and the surfaces of the
rolling elements inevitably subjected to repetitive
compression stress result in flaking due to fatigue of the
raceway an element materials and can resist no longer to
further running even under normal condition. "Bearing life"
is defined as the total cumulative bearing revolutions until
flaking occurs thus on the raceway surface or the element
rolling surfaces. 
Further use of bearings becomes unavailable, caused
by various defects such as seizure, wear, crack, chipping,
chattering, rusting, etc. in addition to the flaking
phenomenon stated above.  However, these phenomena
should be deemed as defects of bearing itself and,
therefore, be discriminated from bearing life.  And the
defect causes are such as incorrect selection of bearing,
improper mounting, improper lubrication, imperfect
sealing, etc.  Hence, bearing trouble can be avoided by
removing the said causes.
2.2  Basic rated life and basic dynamic load rating
Even when a group of same bearings have been in
running under the same condition, considerably great
variation is found among the individual bearing lives. This
comes from variation in material fatigue itself. Hence, the
basic rated life defined below considering statistically this
variation in material fatigue is applied as the bearing life. 
The basic rated life means the substantial total
cumulative revolutions of the individual bearings 90%
(90% reliability) of which can revolve without resulting in
flaking due to rolling fatigue when a group of same
bearings have been put individually in continuous running
under same condition.  When bearings have been in
running in constant revolution, the basic rated life is
expressed as the total cumulative revolutions of the
individual bearings.
On the other hand, the basic dynamic load rating
represents the load capacity of rolling bearing, then
meaning a constant load under which the basic rated life
of 1,000,000 revolutions is achieved. This constant load
of radial bearing is expressed with net radial load, while
that of thrust bearing is expressed with net axial load.  
The bearing dimensions table in this catalogue
describes the respective basic dynamic load ratings of the
bearings that were manufactured using NTN’s standard
materials and manufacturing processes in current use. 
For the respective basic rated lives of the bearings
manufactured using the special materials and special
manufacturing processes, feel free to contact NTN for
inquiry.
The relationship among the basic rated life, the basic
dynamic load rating and the axial load can be expressed
in formula (2.1).

2.3  Bearing-applied machines and requisite life
In selecting a bearing, it is essential to set up the
requisite life of the bearing under the intended operating
conditions, but the requisite life is mainly determined by
the durability period and in-running reliability required for
a machine to which the bearing is applied. In general, the
requisite lifetime as a guideline is as shown in Table 2.1. 
The fatigue life of bearing is an important factor to
decide the bearing size to be applied. In addition to this
factor, however, the strengths and rigidities of shaft and
housing must be taken into consideration.

2.4  Bearing life using the adjusted life rating factor 
The basic bearing life rating (90% reliability) can be
calculated using the formulas prescribed in Subsection
2.2, but on occasion the bearing life of over-90% reliability
must be determined on application. Also, the bearing life
can be further extended by using a specially improved
bearing material and special manufacturing
process/technique. Furthermore, it was clarified by the
elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory that the bearing life
would be influenced by bearing operating conditions
(lubrication, temperature, speed, etc.) 
The bearing life considering the above factors can be
determined by formula (2.7) using "Life Adjustment
Factor" specified in ISO 281.
Lna ＝a1・a2・a3（C／P）
p ……………………(2.7)
where,
Lna : Adjusted life rating 106 revolutions
a1 : Reliability adjustment factor
a2 : Bearing material adjustment factor
a3 : Operating condition adjustment factor 
2.4.1 Reliability adjustment factor  a1
The values of reliability adjustment factor a1for 90%
and higher reliability are as shown in Table 2.2.
2.4.2  Life adjustment factor for bearing material  a2
Where bearing material used is special type and quality
and manufactured in the special process, the life-related
bearing characteristics are inevitably variable depending
on the specialties of the material. In such a case, the
bearing life is adjusted using the life adjustment factor for
bearing material a2. 
The basic dynamic load ratings described in "Bearing
Dimensions Table" are subject to use of the standard
materials and manufacturing processes / techniques
being used in NTN, and usually a2=1 rating is used. 
Furthermore, a2>1 is eventually applied to the bearings
manufactured using the specially improved material and
manufacturing process / technique.  In such a case, feel
free to contact NTN for further instruction. 
Where bearings made of high carbon chrome bearing
steel are used at 120˚C and over throughout a long term,
the dimension of the normal heat-treated bearing varies
significantly and, therefore, dimension-stabilizing heat-
treatment (TS treatment) must be done to the bearings
according to the maximum operating temperature.
However, this dimension-stabilizing treatment causes the
bearing hardness to reduce, finally an inverse affect on
the bearing life. To avoid it, the bearing life is adjusted
(compensated) by multiplying the life rating by the life
adjustment factor for bearing material a2 shown in Table
2.3.

2.4.3  Life adjustment factor for operating conditions a3
The life adjustment factor for operating conditions a3 is
used for adjustment(compensation) of the bearing life,
where the lubricated bearing condition gets worse and the
lubricant deteriorates or foreign matter is included in the
bearing, caused by the rotational speed, temperature rise,
etc. of the bearing in running.
Generally the life adjustment factor in the case of good
lubricated bearing condition is a3=1 and, particularly
where the lubricated bearing condition is good and other
factors for the bearing are normal, a3>1 can be applied to
adjustment of the bearing life. However, a3<1 is applied in
the following cases.
¡Low viscosity of lubrication oil under bearing
temperature in running 
Radial needle roller bearing  13mm2/s and less
Thrust needle roller bearing  20mm2/s and less 
¡Particularly low rotational speed
(The product of rotational speed n r/min by pitch circle
diameter dp mm of rolling element is dp・n<10000.) 
¡High operating temperature of bearing
High operating temperature of bearing would cause the
raceway hardness to reduce, whereby bearing life
would be shortened,  In such a case, the bearing life is
adjusted (compensated) by multiplying the value shown
in Fig.2.1 as the life adjustment factor for operating
conditions depending on operating temperature. 
¡Inclusion of foreign matter in lubricant 
In the case of special operating conditions, feel free to
contact NTN for inquiry. For a bearing manufactured
using the specially improved material and
manufacturing process/technique, usually a2 × a3<1 is
applied unless the lubricating condition is good, even
though the life adjustment factor is a2>1.

2.6  Life of bearing with oscillating motion  
The life of bearing with oscillating motion can be
determined by formula (2.8). 
Losc  ＝ΩLRot ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯(2.8)
where,
Losc : Life of bearing with oscillating motion
LRot : Life rating subject to rotational speed r/min
identical to oscillation frequency cpm
Ω : Oscillation factor (showing the relation with
half angle β of oscillation angle per Fig.2.3).
Generally Fig.2.3 is applied when the oscillation angle
exceeds critical angle 2β.  This critical angle is nearly
determined by design of bearing internals ―mainly the
number of rolling elements included in single row bearing. 
Where a bearing with oscillating motion is used at
below the critical angle, its life is shorter than the lifetime
value calculated using Fig.2.3. When the critical angle is
unknown, determine Ω, assuming β=βC.  Feel free to
contact NTN for inquiry about the critical angle of
individual bearings.

2.5 Affect on basic dynamic load rating by
raceway surface hardness 
When a bearing rolls on shaft surface/housing surface
as its raceway surface, the surface layer must be
hardened to HRC58 to64 in proper hardening depth.
Ordinary quenching, carburizing or induction
quenching, etc. are available as the raceway hardening
method, but low hardness of the raceway would cause to
the bearing fatigue lifetime to reduce. In such a case, the
basic load rating is adjusted by multiplying the hardness
factor shown in Fig.2.2.

roughness and hardness of raceway, heat-treated
structure, misalignment, etc.  In using bearings, therefore,
these influence factors must be taken into full
consideration.  Table 2.4 shows the bearing operating
conditions as a guideline. (For the detail refer to
"Commentary" described in Bearing Dimensions Table

In the case of bearings with linear motion such as linear

can be expressed in formulas (2.10), (2.11).

be determined by formulas (2.12), (2.13).

2.9  Fitting misalignment and crowning 
Generally it is well known that stress concentration at
edge portion (so called, edge load) arising from fitting
misalignment would result in rapid reduction of bearing
lifetime. "Crowning" is adopted as a countermeasure
against such rapid reduction of bearing lifetime. In that
case, however, unless it is designed properly this
crowning would cause the effective contact length of roller
to reduce, which could then lead to shorter life of bearing.
It is therefore necessary to calculate a proper crowning
value though depending on the extent of fitting
misalignment.

As seen from Figs.2.5 to 2.7 (Examples of contact
surface pressure analysis), the rollers with no crowning
have high edge surface pressure, while the rollers with
crowning restrain the edge surface pressure lower in the
range of specific allowable fitting misalignment.  Fig.2.8
shows the relationship of allowable fitting misalignment to
bearing lifetime. (example of computer analysis) It is
possible to see from this Figure how the bearing lifetime
is influenced by fitting misalignment.

It is possible to see from these Figures how the bearing
life is influenced by each factor.
"Basic static load rating" is defined as such a constant
static load that results in permanent deformation of the
said limit value, which is then expressed in net radial load
for radial bearings and in net axial load for thrust
bearings.
Regarding this load value, each table of bearing
dimensions describes it in the Cor, field for radial bearings
and in Coa field for thrust bearings respectively.
When the load defined above acts on a bearing,
contact stress at the contact center of rolling element to
raceway, which are subjected to maximum load, reaches
the following value.
For roller bearing ⋯⋯⋯4000MPa (408kgf/mm2)
For ball bearing
⋯⋯⋯4200MPa (428kgf/mm2)
2.12  Allowable static bearing load
The basic static load rating prescribed in Subsection
2.11 is generally deemed as an allowable static bearing
limit load, but in some cases this allowable limit load is
set up larger than the basic static load rating and in some
other cases it is set up smaller, according to the
requirements for revolving smoothness and friction.  
Generally this allowable limit load is decided
considering the safety factor So in the following formula
(2.14) and Table 2.5.
So =Co／Po……………………………………(2.14)
where,
So : Safety factor
Co : Basic static rated load, N (kgf)

2.11  Basic static load rating 
Load acting on a bearing, when acted, results in locally
permanent deformation of the contract surface of rolling
elements to bearing ring. And this deformation value
increases inevitably with the increasing load and smooth
rotation of the bearing is interfered with by the
deformation when it exceeded a certain limit value.
It is known experimentally that the total permanent
deformation value 0.0001 times as large as the rolling
element diameter at the contact center of rolling elements
to raceway both of which are subjected to maximum
stress is an allowable deformation limit which does not
interfere with smooth rotation of bearing.

3.1  Load acting on shafts
The loads acting on the shaft to be supported with the
bearing must be determined for calculation of bearing
loads. These loads include the self-weight of rotor assy,
loads inevitably resulting from a machine in running,
loads arising from power transmission, etc.  These loads
are mostly difficult to calculate though some of them can
be calculated numerically and theoretically. 
The following paragraphs describe how to calculate
the loads acting on a power transmission shaft as one of
the main bearing applications.
3.1.1 Load acting on gears   
The loads acting on gears can be divided into
tangential load (Kt), radial load (Ks) and axial load (Ka).
The magnitude and acting direction of each load differ
depending on the types of gear.  This paragraph
describes how to calculate the loads acting on parallel
shaft gears and cross shaft gears for general use. 
For calculation of the loads acting on other gears, feel
free to contact NTN for inquiry.
(1) Load acting on parallel shaft gear 
Figs. 3.1 to 3.3 illustrate the loads acting on spur gear
and helical gear which are used with a parallel shaft. The
magnitude of each load can be determined using the
formulas  (3.1) to (3.4).

Ka ：Parallel load acting on gear shaft  N (kgf)
HP：Transmission power  kw
n ：Rotational speed  r/min
Dp ：Pitch circle diameter of gear  mm

Actual gear load is determined by multiplying the
theoretical load by the gear factor described in Table 3.1,
because vibration and shock are added to each
theoretical load determined by the above formulas.

(2) Loads acting on cross shaft gears
Figs. 3.4 and 3.5 illustrate the loads acting on straight-
too bevel gears and spiral bevel gears which are used
with cross shafts. 
Table 3.2 shows how to calculate these loads. 
The load acting on straight-tooth bevel gear can be
determined from Table 3.2, assuming the helix angle as
β =0. 
The symbols and units used in this table are as follows.

Dpm ：Mean pitch circle diameter  mm

In general, the relationship between the loads acting on
pinion and pinion gear can be expressed as follows, due
to the perpendicular intersection of two shafts.

Kap＝Ksg ………………………………………(3.6)
where,
Ksp，Ksg ：Pinion and pinion gear separating force  N (kgf)
Kap，Kag：Axial load acting on pinion and pinion gear  N (kgf)
For spiral bevel gears, the loading direction differs
depending on the direction of helix angle, rotational
direction and whether the spiral bevel gear is located at
the drive side or the driven side.

Considering this initial tension, radial load acting on the

Bearing Accuracy
NTN
The dimensional, profile and running accuracies of
rolling bearings are specified in ISO Standard as
applicable and JIS B 1514 (Accuracy of Rolling Bearings). 
"Dimensional accuracy" and "Profile accuracy" are
the items indispensable in installing the rolling bearings on
a shaft and in a bearing housing, and allowable bearing
run-out in running is specified as the running accuracy.
Dimensional accuracy: 
Dimensional accuracy means the respective allowable
values for bore diameter, outer diameter, width or height
(limaited to thrust bearing) and chamfering dimension. 
Profile accuracy: 
This means the allowable value for variation of each of
bore diameter, mean bore diameter, outer diameter,
mean outer diameter, and width or thickness of bearing
ring (limited to thrust bearing). 
Running accuracy: 
This means the respective allowable values for radial
run-out and axial run-out of both inner ring and outer ring,
lateral run-out of inner ring, and outer diameter run-out of
outer ring. 
Regarding the accuracy class of the machined ring
needle roller bearings, class-0 is equivalent to bearings of
the normal precision class, and precision becomes
progressively higher as the class number becomes
smaller; i.e. Class 6 is less precise than Class 5, which is
less precise than Class 4, and so on. 
Bearings of Class-0 are mostly used for general
application, while bearings of Class-5 or Class-4 are
used, where the required running accuracies and
revolutions are high or less friction and less fluctuation
are required for bearings. 
Various bearing types are available for NTN needle
roller bearings and the representative types and the
accuracy classes applicable to them are as shown in
Table 4.1.
Dimensional item symbols used in the accuracy
standard are given in Table 4.2, the radial bearing
accuracy specified every accuracy class given in Table
4.3, the thrust bearing accuracy specified every accuracy
class given in Table 4.4, and the allowable values for
chamfering dimension given in Table 4.5.

Bearing Internal Clearance
NTN
5.  Bearing Internal Clearance
5.1  Radial clearance 
Radial clearance in bearing (initial radial clearance)
means the displacement value of bearing ring when the
non-fixed ring was displaced in radial direction with either
one of the inner ring and outer ring remained fixed, before
the bearing is installed on a shaft or in a housing. 
Machined ring needle roller bearing (with inner ring) ;
The initial clearance values for this bearing type are as
shown in Table 5.1. Table 5.1 (1) shows the
interchangeable clearances, which are remained
unchanged even after inner ring or outer ring was
reassembled in. Table 5.1(2) shows non-interchangeable
clearances, which do not allow reassembly of inner ring
or outer ring due to the narrow clearance range. The
bearing clearances are represented by the symbols of
C2, ordinary, C3 and C4 in the order from the smallest
one and the non-interchangeable clearance symbols are
followed by "NA" for identification. 
For the radial clearance values for bearing types
other than the machined ring needle roller bearings,
refer to "Commentary" described in the respective
Dimensions Table.
5.2  Running clearance 
5.2.1 Setting up running clearance
Bearing clearance in running, that is, running clearance
gets generally smaller than the initial radial clearance,
depending on the fits and temperature difference
between the inner ring and the outer ring. This running
clearance must be set up optimally because setting up it
improperly would lead to shorter life, overheat and
vibration or running noise of bearing. 
Theoretically the bearing life comes to the maximum
when the running clearance of bearing in normal running
is slightly negative, but it is difficult to always hold this
optimal condition during actual running. If the negative
clearance value gets larger due to change of somewhat
operating condition, it would cause significant reduction
of bearing lifetime and overheat. To avoid such
phenomena, generally proper initial radial clearance is
selected and set up so the running clearance gets slightly
larger than 0 (zero). 
In the case of usual operating conditions, in other words,
application of the fits based on ordinary load, usual
rotational speed and running temperature, etc., an
optimal running clearance can be got by selecting an
ordinary clearance. 
1 Supplementary suffix codes of clearance is not added to bearing
      numbers.

Bearing Internal Clearance
NTN
5.2.2 Calculation of running clearance
The running clearance in bearing can be determined from
initial radial clearance, reduced internal clearance
incurred by effective interference, and temperature
difference between inner ring and outer ring, using
formula (5.1).
δeff ＝δo －（δf ＋δt ）…………………(5.1)
where,
δeff : Running clearance  mm 
δo : Initial radial clearance  mm
δf : Reduced internal clearance incurred by 
effective interference  mm 
δt : Reduced internal clearance incurred by 
temperature difference between inner ring
and outer ring  mm
(1) Reduced internal clearance incurred by effective 
interference 
When a bearing is installed on a shaft or in a housing
with some effective interference, the inner ring expands
and the outer ring shrinks and, as the result, the radial
clearance in the bearing reduces correspondingly.
The expansion or shrinkage of inner ring or outer ring
is approximately equivalent to 85% of the effective
interference though depending on bearing type, shaft or
housing profile, dimension and material. For the detail
refer to Table 6.4 on page A-35.
δf ＝0.85・∆deff
……………………………(5.2)
where,
δf : Reduced internal clearance incurred by 
effective interference  mm
∆deff : Effective interference  mm
(2) Reduced internal clearance incurred by 
temperature difference between inner ring and 
outer ring 
When a bearing is in running, the temperature of its
outer ring is lower by 5 to 10˚C than that of its inner ring
or rolling elements. Also, temperature difference between
the inner ring and the outer ring gets larger when heat is
radiated more from the housing or when the bearing shaft
is communicated with a heat source and a heated fluid is
flowing through a hollowed shaft. In such a case, the
internal clearance reduces corresponding to thermal
expansion difference between the inner ring and the
outer ring which is incurred by this temperature
difference.
δt ＝α・∆T・Do ……………………………(5.3)
where,
δt : Reduced clearance value incurred by 
temperature difference  mm
α : Linear expansion coefficient of bearing steel
12.5 × 10-6/˚C
∆T : Inner ring – outer ring temperature difference ℃
Do : Outer ring raceway diameter  mm
d : Bearing bore diameter  mm
D : Bearing outer diameter  mm 
When a shaft or a housing is used as a direct raceway,
temperature difference between the shaft and the
housing is applied as temperature difference (∆T).
5.3 Fits and bearing radial clearance  
Where the allowable tolerances for the shaft and the
housing hole are already decided, the simple nomogram
as shown in Fig. 5.1 is available as a guideline to
decision of the initial radial clearance of bearing so as to
enable to get an optimal clearance after the bearing was
installed on the shaft/in the housing.  The nomogram in
Fig. 5.1 is used as the guideline as stated above. For the
detail feel free to contact NTN. 
For example, where the fit condition for needle roller
bearing with inner ring is already given as J7m6, Fig.5.1
shows that clearance C3 must be secured to get the
standard running clearance after installation.

Bearing Fits
NTN
7. Bearing Fits 
¡Crack and earlier separation of bearing ring, and
displacement of bearing ring
¡Wear of bearing ring, shaft and housing caused by
creep and fretting corrosion
¡Seizure (sticking) caused by less internal clearance
¡Insufficient running accuracy and abnormal noise
caused by deformed raceway surface 
6.3  Fit selection
Fit selection is generally done in accordance with the
rule specified hereunder.
The loads acting on each bearing ring are divided into
running load, stationary load and directionally unstable
load according to the direction and characteristic of loads
acting on the bearing.
"Tight fit" can be selected for a bearing ring subjected
to running load and directionally unstable load and
"stationary fit" or "loose fit" be selected for a bearing ring
subjected to stationary load. (See Table 6.1) 
Where load of high magnitude or vibration and shock
loads act on a bearing or a light alloy/plastic housing is
used, it is necessary to secure a large interference. In
that case, however, the housing rigidity must be
considered carefully so as not allow occurrence of
split damage, etc.
For an application subjected to high running accuracy,
bearings of high accuracy must be used with a shaft and
a housing of higher dimensional accuracy so as not to
apply a large interference thereto. Applying a large
interference would cause the shaft or housing profile to
be transferred to the bearing track, which could then
interfere with the bearing running accuracy. The said
bearings of high accuracy are used to prevent such
possible phenomena.
6.1  Interference
For rolling bearings, the inner ring and outer ring are
fixed on the shaft or in the housing so that relative
movement does not occur between the fitted surfaces of
the bearing ring and the shaft or housing in radial, axial
and rotational directions when a load acts on the bearing.
Such a relative movement, if occurred, would result in
wear, fretting corrosion, friction crack, etc. on the fitted
surfaces, which would then cause damage of the bearing
and the shaft or the housing. Furthermore, wear powder
invades into the bearing, then causing imperfect rotation,
abnormal overheat, vibration, etc. 
The most effective way to fix a bearing is to assign an
proper interference to the fitted surfaces between the
bearing ring and the shaft or the housing and to thereby
apply "tight fit" to the bearing. Furthermore, as its
advantage this tight fit method supports the thin-walled
bearing ring with uniform load throughout its entire
circumference without any loss of load carrying capacity. 
The needle roller bearing is a bearing type enabling to
separate the inner ring and the outer ring from one
another and, therefore, it can be installed on a shaft or in
a housing with an interference applied to both of its inner
ring and outer ring.  In the case of "tight fit", the easiness
of bearing installation and removal is lost and, therefore,
the bearing ring subjected to stationary load can be
"loose-fitted".
6.2  Necessity of proper fit
Improper fit could lead to damage and shorter life of
bearing.  Therefore, advance careful analysis is needed
for selection of proper fit. Representative examples of
bearing defects caused by improper fit are as described
below.

6.4  Recommended Fits
The dimensional tolerances for the diameter of a shaft
and the hole diameter of a bearing housing, on/in which a
bearing is installed, are standardized under the metric
system in ISO 286 and JIS B 0401 (Dimensional
Tolerances and Bearing Fits).  Hence, bearing fits is
determined by selection of the dimensional tolerances for
shaft diameter and hole diameter as applicable.  Fig. 6.1
shows the relationship between shaft diameter and
bearing bore diameter and between housing hole
diameter and bearing outer diameter.
Table 6.2 shows the recommended fits for the
machined ring needle roller bearings (with inner ring) that
are generally selected based on the dimensional and load
conditions.  Table 6.3 shows the numerical fit values. 
For the recommended fits for others than the
machined ring needle roller bearings, refer to
"Commentary" described in the respective Dimension
Tables.

(3) Fitting surface roughness and required
interference  
The fitting surface is smoothed (surface roughness is
made less) by bearing fits so that the interference
reduces correspondingly.  The interference reduced value
differs depending on the fitting surface roughness and
generally the following reduction values must be
prospected.
For ground shafts          : 1.0 to 2.5mm
For lathe-turned shafts  : 5.0 to 7.0 mm
(4) Maximum interference  
Bearing ring fitted, with interference, on a shaft or in a
housing results in tensile stress or compressive stress.
Over-interference could cause cracking /splitting of
bearing and short fatigue life of bearing. Therefore, in
general the maximum interference is secured at 1/1000
and less of shaft diameter or otherwise it is secured so
the circumferential maximum stress generating on the
fitting surface comes to 130MPa or less.  (See Table 6.4) 
(5) Stress and deformation caused by interference   
When bearing ring (solid) is fitted with interference, it
deforms elastically and this elastic deformation results in
stress.(See Fig.6.2) The fitting surface pressure of
bearing ring, circumferential tensile stress (inner ring),
compressive stress (outer ring) and radial expansion of
raceway (inner ring), and shrinkage(outer ring) can be
calculated from Table 6.4.
6.5  Interference Calculation

required to prevent a clearance between its inner ring and
a steel solid shaft can be expressed in formulas (6.1)
and (6.2).

Shaft and Housing Design
NTN
Even if the bearing to be used is selected correctly, it
can not fulfill its specific function unless the shaft/housing
on/in which it is installed is designed correctly.
Particularly for needle roller bearings the shaft and the
housing must be designed under special consideration
because the bearing ring thickness is thinner than that of
other rolling bearings. 
7.1 Design of bearing installing portions 
Where a needle roller bearing with cage is used as an
individual and is guided in axial direction directly by shaft
shoulder (Fig.7.1), the shaft shoulder with which the cage
side face comes in contact must be finished accurately
and also is not allowed to have any raiser thereon.  For a
needle roller bearing subjected to high speed running, its
contact surface is hardened and thereafter fine-finished
by grinding.  
When a snap ring is used for axial guide of the cage
(Fig.7.1), a thrust ring is inserted between the cage and
the snap ring to prevent the cut section of the snap ring
from contacting directly the cage. NTN shaft snap ring
WR type specially designed for NTN needle roller
bearings is available as the snap ring intended for axial
guide of bearing cage. (Refer to Dimensions Table on
page B-227.)  
On other hand, radial needle roller bearing can move
freely in axial direction so that a ball bearing or a thrust
bearing is used at single side for axial positioning of the
shaft.  Where axial load is less and, in addition, rotational
speed is not so high(Ex. idle gear in a gear box), a thrust
ring is fitted on the shaft, as illustrated in Fig. 7.2 and a
sliding bearing is formed between the thrust ring and the
outer ring or the housing end face for the purpose of axial
positioning.  In such a design, good care must be
exercised so the guide surface is fully lubricated. Fig.7.3
illustrates an example of the above thrust ring with oil
groove on its guide surface.  The boundary between this
oil groove and the plane area must be chamfered for
deburring. 
In general, for proper installation of needle roller
bearing the inner ring and outer ring are both positioned
in axial direction so that the bearing displaces in axial
direction while running.

(1) Inner ring 
For fixing inner ring correctly on a shaft, the shaft
shoulder face is finished at the right angle against the
shaft axial center and, in addition, the shaft corner is
rounded smaller than the inner ring chamfer dimension. 
Where the corner roundness ra max must be made
larger for specific shaft strength (Fig.7.4a) or the shaft
shoulder is low (Fig. 7.4b), a spacer must be inserted
between the shaft shoulder and the inner ring to hold a
full contact surface with the inner ring.  Furthermore, for
facilitating inner ring pull-out work the shaft shoulder is
provided with a notched groove,as illustrated in Fig. 7.5,
to accept an inner ring pull-out jig (puller). 
NTN snap ring WR type for shaft use (Refer to
Dimensions Table on page B-227) can be used for simply
fixing inner ring in axial direction. (Fig. 7.6)  Moreover,
inner ring can be fixed in axial direction using an end
plate or a side ring as illustrated in Figs. 7.7 and 7.8.

(2) Outer ring
Similarly to Para. 7.1(1) "Inner Ring", good care
exercised of the shoulder profile of bearing housing for
fixing outer ring in axial direction. 
Figs. 7.9 and 7.10 illustrate the methods of fixing outer
ring in axial direction. 
NTN housing snap ring BR type (Refer to Dimensions
Table on page B-229) can be used for fixing outer ring in
axial direction.  NTN BR type snap rings are designed to
the dimensions adaptable to the needle roller bearings
with low section height.  However, commercially available
snap rings conforming to JIS standard as applicable can
also be used for the same bearings with adequately high
section height. 
Fig. 7.9  Outer ring fixing by lid 
Fig. 7.10  Outer ring fixing by snap ring  
7.2 Bearing fitting dimensions
The respective shoulder heights "h" of shaft and
housing are designed larger than the maximum chamfer
dimension rs max for bearing so the bearing end face
comes in contact with the flat zone.  And the corner
roundness "ras" is designed smaller than the minimum
chamfer dimension "rs" of bearing so as not to interfere
with the bearing.  Generally the radius of shaft and
housing corner roundness shown in Table 7.1 is used as
the shoulder heights of shaft and housing.
The dimensions of the shafts and housings related to
bearing installation are as described in the dimensions
table for each bearing type. The shoulder diameter shown
in this table means the effective shoulder diameter which
comes in contact with the side face of bearing excluding
the chamfered portion of shoulder.
When the fitting surface of shaft or housing is finished
by grinding, the shoulder corner must be provided with a
relief.  This relief dimension is as shown in Table 7.2.

7.3 Shaft and housing accuracy
Because of its thin wall, the raceway surface accuracy
of needle roller bearing ring is influenced by the
respective fitting surface accuracy of a shaft /a housing
on/in which the needle roller bearing is installed. In the
case of general operating conditions, the fitting surfaces
of shaft and housing may be finished by lathe-turning, but
those must be finished by grinding where the acting load
is great and, in addition, the requirements for accuracy
and sound are strict. 
Table 7.3 shows the fitting surface accuracy, profile
accuracy, surface roughness, and shoulder
perpendicularity to fitting surface of each of shaft and
housing under ordinary operating conditions.
7.5  Material and hardness of raceway surface 
When the outer surface or bore surface of
shaft(hollowed) or housing is used as raceway, it must be
hardened to HRC58 to 64 for getting sufficient load
capacity. For that, the materials shown in Table 7.5 are
used after heat-treated properly.

Remarks: The parenthesized values are applied to the bearings of accuracy

Where a two-split housing is used, deformation of outer
ring by housing clamping can be minimized by providing a
relief on the mating surface at bore side.
7.4  Raceway surface accuracy
For needle roller bearings, shaft and housing are used
as the raceway surface on application. The raceway
dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy and surface
roughness of shaft/housing must be equivalent to the
raceway accuracy of bearing itself.  Table 7.4 shows the
specified surface accuracy and surface roughness of
shaft/housing raceway.
When steel is surface-hardened by carburizing or
carbonitriding, JIS Standard as applicable defines the
depth from surface up to HV550 as an effective hardened
layer.  The minimum value of effective hardened layer
depth is approximately expressed in formula (7.1).

Where,
Eht min : Minimum effective hardened layer depth   mm

7.6   Allowable bearing inclination
The inner ring and outer ring of bearing incline a little
eventually against one another depending on shaft
deflection, shaft /housing machining accuracy, fitting
deviation, etc. Although this allowable inclination differs
depending on bearing type, bearing load, internal
clearance, etc., the inclination degree shown in Table 7.6
must be used as a guideline in the case of general
applications because even minor inclination of inner ring
and outer ring could cause reduction of bearing life and
damage of cage.

Lubrication
NTN
8.  Lubrication
The purpose of lubricating bearings is to form a thin oil
film on the rolling and sliding surfaces and to thereby
prevent metal to metal direct contact. Furthermore,
lubricating rolling bearings has the following effects. 
(1) Reduction of friction and wear  
(2) Discharge of friction heat
(3) Further extension of bearing life 
(4) Rusting prevention 
(5) Prevention of foreign matter invasion
For achieving these lubrication effects it is necessary to
select a good quality lubricant, to remove dust from the
lubricant, and to design a proper seal structure for
prevention of lubricant leak as well as to adopt the
lubrication method suitable to the respective actual
operating conditions. 
Rolling bearings are mostly lubricated with grease or
oil, but solid lubricants such as molybdenum disulfide,
graphite, etc. are used for special application. 
Further, the comparative data of grease lubrication and
oil lubrication given in Table 8.1 can be utilized as the
selection guide.
8.1  Grease lubrication 
Grease lubrication is the simplest lubrication method.
This method enabling to simplify design of the seal
structure is broadly used. 
Important points in this lubrication method are to select
an optimum grease and to fill it securely in a bearing.
Particularly where the cage is guided by the inner ring or
outer ring of bearing, good care must be exercised so the
guide surface is fully greased throughout its entire area.
Furthermore, for grease replenishment it is desirable to
provide a grease sector and a grease valve, etc. as a
grease replenisher.  Fig. 8.1 illustrates an example of
bearing unit with grease sector and grease valve.

Table 8.1 Characteristic comparison of grease lubrication with 
oil lubrication
8.1.1  Types and characteristics of grease  
Lubrication oil is composed of a lubrication base oil (ex.
mineral oil base or a synthetic oil base) held with a
thickener and various additives added thereto. The
properties of grease is determined by the kinds and
combination of base oil, thickener and additives. 
Table 8.2 shows the general types of grease and their
characteristics. Even the grease of same type is
significantly different in the performance depending on
the grease brand selected.  In selecting a grease brand,
therefore, it is necessary to verify the property data
submitted from the grease manufacturer. 
8.1.2  Base oil
Mineral oil or synthetic oils such as diester oil, and
synthetic oil such as silicone oil, fluorocarbon oil, etc. are
used as the base oil for grease. 
The lubrication performance of grease is mainly
determined by the lubrication performance of the base oil.
In general, a grease composed of low viscosity base oil is
excellent in low temperature characteristic and high
speed performance and, on the other hand, a grease
composed of high viscosity base oil is excellent in high
load characteristic. 
8.1.3  Thickener
Thickener is blended and diffused in base oil to hold
grease in semi-solid form. And various thickeners are
available for use as follows; thickener composed of
metallic soap such as lithium, sodium or calcium, etc.,
thickener composed of inorganic material such as silica
gel, bentonite, etc., and non-soap base thickener
composed of organic material such as polyurea,
fluorocarbon, etc. 
The grease characteristics such as critical operating
temperature, mechanical stability, durability, etc. are
mainly determined by the kind of thickener used. In
general, the sodium soap base grease is inferior to others
in water resistance.  Non-metallic soap base thickener
composed of bentone, polyurea, etc. is excellent in high
temperature characteristic.

Remarks: The operating temperature range in this table is the general characteristic value, not the guaranteed value.
Operating
temperature range
8.1.4  Additives
Any greases contain various additives to improve the
performance, for example, containing oxidation inhibitor,
extreme pressure additives (EP additives), rust inhibitor,
corrosion inhibitor, etc. 
A grease containing extreme pressure additives is used
for bearings subjected to high load or shock load.  A
grease containing oxidation stabilizer is used for bearing
applications wherein the operating temperature is
comparatively high and no grease is replenished for a
long time.
8.1.5  Consistency
"Consistency" is an index showing the hardness or
fluidity of grease. The greater numerical value thereof is
the softer hardness. This consistency is determined by
the amount of thickener and the viscosity of base oil.
Usually NLGI consistency codes 1 and 2 or 3 are used for
lubrication of bearings.  
Table 8.3 shows the general relationship of grease
consistency to application.
8.1.6  Grease mixing 
When different greases are mixed together, the
consistency of the mixed grease varies (generally
softens) so that the allowable operating temperature gets
lower.  To avoid such characteristic variation of grease, it
is not allowed to mix different greases, except mixing
greases of same brand.
Where mixing of different greases is inevitable, greases
composed of thickener of same kind and similar base oil must
be selected.  Even when greases of same kind are mixed
together, thus, the properties of the mixed grease could vary
depending on difference in additives, etc. It is therefore
necessary to check the property variation in advance. 
8.1.7  Grease fill amount 
Grease fill amount differs depending on housing
design, spacing volume, rotational speed, kind of grease,
etc. 
Around 50% to 80% of static spacing volume in bearing
and housing is deemed as a guideline to the fill amount.
In the case of high rotational speed, this fill amount must
be set up a little bit less for controlling temperature rise to
a low rate.  Too much fill amount of grease would
cause the grease temperature to rise higher, which
would then lead to reduction of the specific
lubrication performance due to leak of the softened
grease or quality change such as oxidation, etc.
Further, for the machined ring needle roller bearing with
inner ring the approximate value of spacing volume in the
bearing can be determined by formula (8.1).
V＝35W

deem the intersection point with the vertical line ! as A.
Thereafter, connect no /n=3 point B on the vertical line @
and said A point together, with a straight line, and
determine the intersection point C with the vertical line #.
And the grease replenishing interval of approximately
4600 hours can be read from the intersection point C.
8.2  Oil lubrication
In general, oil lubrication is more suitable for high
speed running application or high temperature application
than grease lubrication. Oil lubrication is suitable for the
case where heat value generating from a bearing or heat
value being transferred to a bearing must be discharged
outside the bearing. 
8.2.1  Lubrication method 
(1) Oil bath lubrication
This oil bath lubrication is the most common of the
currently available oil lubrication methods, which is
applied to bearings running at low or medium speed.
An important point in this method is control of oil level
in an oil bath. 
For that, when bearings are installed on a horizontal
shaft, it is common that a point close to the center of
the rolling element in the lowest position should be
deemed as the oil level to be secured during
shutdown. In this case, the housing must be designed
in such a profile as to minimize variation in oil level
therein. Furthermore, it is desirable to provide the
housing with an oil gauge to facilitate level check
during running as well as shutdown. 
When bearings are installed on a vertical shaft, it is
okay if 50 to 80% of the rolling elements are dipped in
an oil bath under low speed running, but in the cases
of high speed running and bearings used in multiple
rows it is desirable to adopt the drip lubrication and
circulating lubrication methods, and others described
hereunder.  
(2) Spray lubrication
This method sprays lubrication oil by an impeller of
simple structure, which is mounted on the shaft,
without directly dipping a bearing in an oil batch. This
can be applied to bearings running at considerably
high speed. 
(3) Drip lubrication
This lubrication method is used where bearing runs at
comparatively high speed and medium and less loads
act on thereon. In this method, oil drips from an oiler
provided on the top of a bearing unit strikes the rolling
elements in its housing for atomizing lubrication (Fig.
8.3) or otherwise 
a small amount of oil passes through the bearing. In
many cases bearing is lubricated with several drips
per minute though the number of oil drips per specific
unit differs depending on bearing type and dimension.
8.1.8 Grease replenishment
Lubrication grease must be replenished at an proper
interval because its lubrication performance deteriorates
with elapse of the bearing running time. However, this
replenishing interval differs depending on bearing type,
dimension, rotational speed, bearing temperature, kind of
grease used, etc.  
Fig.8.2 gives the replenishing interval chart as a
guideline. This chart is subject to use of a grease for
ordinary rolling bearings under usual operating
conditions. 
Needless to say, the grease replenishing interval must
be the shorter as the bearing temperature gets higher. As
an approximate guideline, when the bearing temperature
is 80˚C or more, the replenishing interval shall be
shortened by 1/1.5 whenever the bearing temperature
rises by 10˚C.

Lubrication

(4) Circulating lubrication  
This circulating lubrication method is adopted to cool
down bearings or to lubricate automatically many
lubricating portions by a centralized lubrication
system. In more detail, as the features of this method
the oil feed line is equipped with a cooler to cool down
the lubrication oil and, in addition, provided with an oil
filter to purify the lubrication oil. 
Under this circulating lubrication system, the
lubrication oil must securely be discharged from each
bearing after having passed through it. For that, it is
important to provide an oil inlet and an oil outlet on
each bearing in opposite position and to make the oil
discharge port size as large as possible or otherwise
to discharge the oil compulsorily. (Fig.8.4) 
(5) Others
Jet lubrication, oil mist lubrication, air-operated oil
lubrication, etc. are available as other lubrication
methods.
Fig. 8.3  Drip lubrication
Fig.8.4  Circulating lubrication
8.2.2 Lubrication oil 
Mineral oils such as spindle oil, machine oil, turbine oil,
etc. are mostly used as the lubrication oil for bearings.
However, synthetic oils such as diester oil, silicone oil,
fluorocarbon oil, etc. are used under the operating
conditions wherein bearings are subjected to running at
high temperature of 150˚C and over or low temperature of
-30˚C and less. 
For lubrication oil, its viscosity is one of the important
characteristics that determine the lubrication
performance.  Too low viscosity of lubrication oil would
cause imperfect forming of an oil film and finally cause
damage of bearing surface, while too high viscosity of
lubrication oil would cause great viscosity resistance,
which would then lead to temperature rise and increase of
friction loss.  
Generally lubrication oil of lower viscosity is used for
the faster rotational speed of bearing, while lubrication oil
of higher viscosity is used for the heavier bearing load.  
Lubrication of bearings needs the oil viscosity every
each operating temperature which is specified in Table
8.4.  Fig. 8.5 shows the lubrication oil viscosity -
temperature characteristic chart, which is referred to in
selecting a lubrication oil of optimal viscosity under actual
operating temperature. 
Furthermore, Table 8.5 shows the criterion for selection
of the lubrication oil viscosity according to the actual
bearing operating conditions.

8.2.3  Oil quantity 
Under an forced oil lubrication system, heat value
generating from bearing, etc. is equal to the sum of heat
value radiated from housing and heat value carried away
by lubrication oil. 
Where a standard housing is used, the oil lubrication
quantity as a guideline can be determined by formula
(8.2).  The radiated heat value differs depending on the
shape /profile of a housing used. It is therefore desirable
to determine the lubrication quantity best-suited to an
actual equipment by adjusting it from a value
approximately 1.5 to 2 times as much as the lubrication
rate determined by formula (8.2).  In addition, Where the
lubrication quantity is calculated assuming that the
generated heat value is all carried away by the oil, with no
heat radiation from the housing, the oil quantity q can be
determined, assuming that the shaft diameter on 2nd
vertical line from the right side in (Fig. 8.6) Chart for
Determination of Oil Quantity q is d=0. 
Q= K・q ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯(8.2)

8.2.4 Fresh oil refilling interval
Although it depends on actual operating
conditions, oil quantity and the kind of lubrication oil
used, the fresh oil refilling interval as a guideline is
around one year where bearings are lubricated with
oil of 50˚C and lower temperature by the oil bath
method and is at least 3 months where bearings are
lubricated with oil of 80 to 100˚C.
For an important equipment it is desirable to
monitor periodically the lubrication performance,
cleanliness deterioration, etc. of the lubrication oil in
use and to specify the fresh oil refilling interval under
the monitor data.

Sealing Devices
NTN
9.1  Non-contact seal and contact seal
The purpose of using a seal is to prevent a lubricant
held in a bearing from leaking outside the bearing and to
prevent powder, water content, etc. from invading into the
bearing from outside. 
It is very important to design a sealing device with good
care, under full consideration of the operating conditions,
lubricating condition, environmental condition, economical
merit, etc., so that bearing running is not inversely
affected by the sealing device.
The bearing seals are mainly classified into non-contact
seal, contact seal, etc. as shown in Tables 9.1 and 9.2,
which must then be selected correctly according to each
application,under full consideration of the characteristics
of each sealing type.

<Oil groove seal> 
This seal is fitted at either one side of a housing or a shaft, or
fitted at the both sides for sealing action. In this case, this seal
has also an effect in preventing invasion of foreign matter from
outside by holding grease in the oil groove.
< Labyrinth seal > 
This seal having a high sealing effect due to its multi-stage
labyrinths and long passage is mainly used for grease lubrication.
Generally it is suited to high speed bearing running, but it has a
dust-proofing effect even under low speed running if the seal
grooves are filled up with grease. It is convenient if this seal is
provided with a grease nipple. 
 In oil lubrication, this seal has
an effect in slinging and returning
the oil flown out along its sleeve
by a centrifugal force if its sleeve
is provided with projections.

This seal type seals a fluid perfectly by pressing its elastic body

Generally the contact seals are more excellent in sealing
performance than the non-contact seals, but the friction torque
and temperature rise thereof are greater than those of the
non-contact seals.  
<Felt seal> 
This is the simplest of the contact seals, which is mainly used for
grease lubrication and suited to prevention of fine dust, but oil
penetration and outflow are occasionally unavoidable to some
extent. 
< Oil seal > 
This seal type intended to seal lubricant at the sliding portion
between its lip and a shaft has good sealing effect and is an
effective seal in the most frequent use.
The lip must be oriented outward to prevent invasion of water
content and foreign matter from outside and oriented inward to
prevent lubricant from leaking out of the housing. Furthermore,
another seal type with two or more lips is also available for
preventing lubricant leak and dust-proofing individually.

9.2  Combined seals
Several seal types are used in combination for a seal
application under an environment where dust, water

which are not allowed to be contaminated by lubricant
leak.
9.3  Clearance setting 
Oil groove seal and labyrinth seal have the better
sealing effect as the shaft - housing clearance gets the
smaller, but the actual clearance is generally selected
from the following clearance values, under consideration
of machining and assembling conditions, shaft
deformation, etc.
9.6  Seal types and allowable speed  
The allowable speed for the contact seal type depends
on the surface roughness, accuracy and lubrication
property of sliding surface, operating temperature, etc.
Table 9.6 shows the allowable speed every each seal
type, as a guideline.

For improving better the wear resistance of shaft surface
it is desirable to secure the shaft surface hardness at
least at HRC40 and over (at HRC55 and over if possible)
by heat treatment and hard chrome plating.

Bearing Handling
NTN
10.  Bearing Handling
A rolling bearing is a precision part. It must be handled
very carefully to keep its preciseness unchanged.
Particularly the handling instructions given hereunder
must be observed in handling.
[1] Keeping bearing and other related parts clean
Foreign matters such as mist, dust, etc. would cause
harmful affect on bearing running and life. To avoid
such harmful effect, bearing and other parts mounted
adjacent to the bearing must be kept clean and, in
addition, handling tools, lubricant, washing oil, work
environment, etc. must always be maintained in clean
condition respectively.
[2] Careful handling
Any shock to a bearing in handling would result in
surface flaw and indent of its raceway surface and
rolling elements and, in the worst case, result in
cracking and chipping. To avoid such defects and
trouble, bearings must be handled with good care.
[3] Use of proper handling tools
It should be avoided to use another inappropriate tool
as an alternative of the specific tool in installing and
removing.
Specific tools suited to the individual bearing types
must be used.  The special-purposed handling tools
must be used particularly when installing a drawn cup
needle roller bearing. 
[4] Protection of bearing from rusting
A rust preventive oil is coated on all of bearings, as a
rule. However, direct handling of bearings by the bare
hands would cause rusting of the bearings from
adhesion of hand sweat thereto. To protect bearings
from rusting, a pair of gloves must be put on or
otherwise mineral oil be coated on the hands in the
case of direct handling by the bare hands.
10.1  Bearing storage
Bearings are all shipped after coated with rust inhibitor
and packaged. It is desirable to store bearings at room
temperature and relative humidity of 60% and less. The
storage period of a grease-filled and sealed bearing is
limited to the specific lifetime of non-greased bearing.
10.2  Installation
Although depending on bearing type and fitting
conditions, the bearing installing methods described
hereunder are selectively available as the general
method.  However, refer to Commentary given in the
Dimensions Table for installation of the drawn cup needle
roller bearings. 
(1) Preparations prior to installing  
For installation of bearings it is desirable to prepare a
cleaned and dried work place. 
Contaminant, burr, chips, etc. must be removed
completely from all the parts related to a shaft and a
housing before installing.
Fig. 10.1  Press-fitting of inner ring 
Furthermore, the bearing mount must be inspected to
verify whether its dimensional accuracy, profile
accuracy and surface roughness are within the
respective specified tolerance ranges.
Bearings are all unpacked before installing. In the
case of using bearings with grease lubrication,
generally they may be installed as are without
washing off the rust inhibitor coated thereon. 
Where a bearing is used with oil lubrication or the
lubricating function of a grease-lubricated bearing is
impaired by a mixture of grease and rust inhibitor,
however, the bearing must be installed after complete
removal of the rust inhibitor by clean washing oil. 
It is not allowed to wash shield type and seal type
bearings and one-way clutch.
(2) Press-fit by a press machine
In general, the press-fit method using a press machine
is widely used for installation of bearings. In detail, the
bearing ring (inner ring or outer ring) is press-fitted
slowly via a backing strip as illustrated in Fig. 10.1. It
is not allowed to apply the press force to a bearing
via its rolling elements like a bad example
illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (page A-50).
Further, a small size bearing with small interference
may be installed by hammering the bearing ring with a
plastic hammer or the like. In that case, however, the
uniform hammering force must be applied to the
bearing side face via the backing strip as
illustrated in Fig. 10.1, because direct hammering
to the bearing end face or partial hammering by
use of a punch could impair the specific bearing
performance.
Fitting the inner ring on a shaft by hammering the
outer ring or fitting the inner ring by hammering itself
would result in surface flaw and indent of the raceway
surface and the rolling elements. Therefore, doing so
must be avoided absolutely. 
Also, friction of the fitting surface can be reduced by
coating high viscosity oil on the surface.

(3) Shrinkage fit 
This shrinkage fit method is to fit the inner ring on a
shaft after dipping it in hot oil for thermal expansion of
its bore. This method is also widely used for
installation of bearings. In heating the inner ring, low-
corrosive mineral oil or the like is used. In this case,
the heated inner ring is natural-cooled down after
shrinkage-fit, but simultaneously it shrinks in axial
direction, too. Therefore, the inner ring must be
pressed to the shaft shoulder until adequate cool-
down, so as not to allow a clearance between the
inner ring and the shoulder. 
In any case, however, it is not allowed to heat the
inner ring up to over 120˚C. 
Fig. 10.3 shows the relationship of inner ring bore
thermal expansion to heating temperature.

10.3 Post-installation running test  
Bearing running test must be conducted on an installed
bearing to check whether it was installed correctly. In this
case, accelerating immediately the running speed up to
the rated speed must be avoided absolutely. Doing so
could result in damage of the bearing in the case of
imperfect installation and seizure of the bearing in the
case of inadequate lubrication. In testing, therefore, the
shaft or the housing must first be rotated by hand and
thereafter the shaft be rotated at low speed under no-load
condition by the driving power, unless any failure is
detected upon checking. After that, the running speed
and load on the bearing must be accelerated and
increased gradually while checking the running condition. 
Running sound level and tone of a bearing can be
checked by a sound scope held in contact with the
bearing housing. The sound is normal if it is a pure sound
upon checking.  In this case, high metallic sound or
irregular sound from the bearing, if any, reveals
occurrence of somewhat failure.  In such a case, possible
cause of the failure can be presumed by measuring
quantitatively vibration amplitude and frequency using a
vibrometer.
Generally bearing temperature is presumed from the
circumferential temperature of a housing. However, it can
be judged more exactly if possible to measure directly the
outer ring temperature by utilizing the oil hole thereof, etc.  
Needless to say, bearing temperature rises with elapse
of the running time and reaches a constant level after a
certain time.  Rapid bearing temperature rise or continued
temperature rise in excess to the constant level or
abnormally high bearing temperature would reveals
occurrence of somewhat failure. In such a case, careful
check is required.  
Table 10.1 shows the required check items.

10.4 Bearing removal (dismounting)
Some related bearings are removed from each shaft,
incurred by periodic disassembly or incidental trouble of a
machine. In this case, these bearings must be handled
with good care similarly to the case of installation, when
they are reused or the condition thereof is examined after
removed (dismounted).  Too tight fit of a bearing would
incur difficulty in dismounting and, therefore, the bearing-
related construction must be fully considered in design of

the bearing fixing method.
Regarding the dismounting method, generally the press
method (Fig. 10.4) and the puller method (Fig.10.5) are
available for dismounting inner ring though depending on
bearing type and fitting conditions. 
When inner ring is dismounted from a shaft by heating,
good care must be exercised not to over-heat the inner ring.

ring on / from a shaft can be determined by formula
(10.1).
d
Ka＝fK fE ――――ΔdF……………………………………(10.1)
d+3
Where,
Ka
：Force required for press-fitting or pulling-out   N (kgf)
fK
：Resistance factor being determined by shaft to 
inner ring friction factor
For press-fitting……… 40 (4)
For pulling-out…………60 (6)
fE
：Coefficient depending on inner ring dimension
d
fE ＝B〔1－（――）
2 〕
F1
B
：Inner ring width    mm
d
：Inner ring bore diameter    mm
F1
：Mean outer diameter of inner ring    mm
ΔdF：Apparent interference    μm 
Actual press-fit force and pull-out force could eventually
exceed the respective calculate value due to installing
error. Hence, it is recommended to design the
dismounting tools so as to have the strength (rigidity)
resistible to a load 5 times as much as the calculated
press-fit force and pull-out force.
10.6  Washing
Rotating a bearing with foreign matter adhered thereto
could result in damage of the raceway surface, etc.
Therefore, any dismounted bearing is usually washed by
light oil or kerosene or the like for complete removal of
foreign matter. In this case, two washing vessels must be
used as follows; one for rough washing and another for
finish washing. Rough washing is done for removal of oil
and foreign matter from bearing, while finish washing is
done for fine washing of the roughly-washed bearing.
Further, any vessels used for washing must be provided
with a steel net as the middle bottom above the vessel
bottom, as illustrated in Fig. 10.6, to prevent the bearing
from coming in direct contact with the vessel bottom. 
Furthermore, rust preventive treatment must be applied
to the washed bearing immediately after washing, to
thereby protect it from a risk of corrosion. 
In addition, the legal requirements as applicable
(environmental preservation, industrial labor safety and
health, etc.) and the washing specification submitted from
a detergent manufacturer must be taken in consideration
in washing.

11. 1  HL Bearing 
The form of bearing separation life can be mainly
classified into the internal origin type and the surface
origin type. Bearing separation of the surface origin type
is said to occur in an inadequately lubricated area and it
is widely recognized that the bearing separation life
correlates to the oil film parameter that can be determined
by "Elastic Fluid Lubrication Theory (EHL Theory)". 
This oil film parameter must be increased for controlling
the surface origin type separation and, for that, the
bearing manufacturers have made possible effort for
better improvement of lubricant and for upgrading of the
bearing rolling raceway surface roughness.  
In recent years it has been proposed by the relative
field that the capability of forming an oil film on contact
surfaces could be improved better by changing the form
and directivity of surface roughness of machined parts. 
On the other hand, NTN developed successfully long
life HL (High Lubrication) bearings under "Micro EHL
Theory" as one of the countermeasures against surface
origin type separation. And these HL bearings have been
widely used in each field since developed. 
11.1.1 Basic concept of HL bearing  
Fig. 11.1 illustrates the basic concept of the HL
bearing. 
In this Figure, the hatched area shows a contact
portion deformed elastically and the dotted line shows the
lubrication flow, based on "Internal lubrication fluid flow
model in contact portion" disclosed by H.S. Cheng and
others.
Lubricant flow in (B) has a resistance greater than that
in (A).  This means that the quantity of a fluid existing
internally in the contact portion increases. In other words,
the thickness of an oil film formed on the rolling contact
surface increases with increase of the fluid quantity. 
11.1.2 HL surface   
Fig. 11.2 is a magnified photo showing roller surface. In
this Figure the blackened spots are micro recessed spots
and, as seen from this Figure, a number of micro oil pots
of around several tens mm exist at random. The recessed
spots on this surface can be modified into any optional
size and the number of spots by changing the machining
conditions.  Fig. 11.3 shows the bus line form of the HL
surface, from which the depth of the micro recessed spots
is nearly 1 mm.  
11.1.3  HL bearing application examples  
The HL surface-treated bearings are widely used in
various fields. For example, they are used for car
transmission, hydraulic devices, various reduction gears,
etc.  
As an example of special application, HL surface
treatment is applied to the special-purposed bearing for
the rocker arm of car engine. This is highly appreciated
as an effective seizure preventive measure.

11.2  Bearings with Solid Grease  
Bearings with Solid Grease means a bearing in which
thermal solidification type grease (mainly composed of
lubrication grease and resin) is filled as a lubricant
material. 
Once this thermal solidification type grease (referred to
as Bearings with Solid Grease) was heated and cooled
down (hereinafter referred to "heat treatment"), the paste-
like grease hardens as much lubricant held unchanged. 
The Bearings with Solid Grease is solidified after heat
treatment so that the lubricant does not leak easily even
in the case wide amplitude vibration and strong centrifuge
act on the bearing, thus contributing to prevention of
lubricant leak and longer bearing life.  
The spot pack specification in which Bearings with
Solid Grease was packed at multiple points on the cage
and the full pack specification in which Bearings with
Solid Grease was nearly full-packed in the spacing
volume of bearing are both available for the Bearings with
Solid Grease.  Further, the needle roller bearings are all
based on the full pack specification. 
11.2.1 Characteristics of Bearings with Solid Grease      
(1) Less lubricant leak
Bearings with Solid Grease holds much lubricant
internally in bearing because it is solidified after heat
treatment. This lubricant is gradually fed onto the
rolling surface by heat generating from the bearing
and centrifuge, whereby lubricant leak is minimized.
This serves to prevent the peripheral environment
from being contaminated, comparing with general
lubrication greases.  
(2) Good lubricating characteristic  
Even when wide amplitude vibration and strong
centrifuge act on a bearing, lubricant does not leak
easily and, in addition, Bearings with Solid Grease
does not emulsify and flow out easily, because of its
solid type, even in the case of water content inflow to
bearing.
Thus, the lubricating characteristic is more excellent
than general lubrication greases. 
(3) Sealing effect   
Bearings with Solid Grease acts as a preventive
barrier against foreign matters (water content, dust,
etc.) invading from outside, but does not function
perfectly as a seal. Therefore, use of the contact type
rubber seal (for deep groove ball bearing, bearing
unit) or another seal (for other bearings) is
recommended particularly when high sealing
performance is required. 
11.2.2 Attentive points in using Bearings with Solid Grease
(1) The needle roller bearing dimension to accept
Bearings with Solid Grease differs every each bearing
type. Feel free to contact NTN for the detail.  
(2) The allowable temperature range is -20˚C to 80˚C, but
60˚C and less for continuous long term running. Fully
note the operating temperature. 
(3) Allowable rotational speed Fw･n value (Fw = inscribed
circle diameter [mm]) × (n= operating rotational
speed [r/min]) is differs from that in use of general
grease and lubrication oil. 
Fully note this matter.  
Use any needle roller bearings on Fw･n value =
30,000 and less. 
(4) For the bearings of the full pack specification,
minimum load equivalent to at least around 1% of the
basic dynamic load rating is needed for enabling the
rolling elements to run without slipping. 
(5) Bearings with Solid Grease acts as a preventive
barrier against foreign matter invading from outside,
but does not function perfectly as a seal. Therefore,
combined use of Bearings with Solid Grease and
rubber seal is recommended particularly when high
sealing performance is required.

Grease bearings

：Housing inner diameter    mm  
T
：Roller diameter + plate thickness    mm  
D
：Outer diameter of drawn cup needle roller bearing   mm 
Li ：Post press-fit inscribed circle diameter    mm 
When the master ring is press-fitted, the dimension of
"roller diameter + plate thickness" remains unchanged.
Hence, the inscribed circle diameter Li is determined by
the following formula.
Li＝D－2T－λ（D－H）＝（1－λ）D－2T＋λH
……(11.2)
Determine the mean value of "roller diameter + plate
thickness" (=T) and standard deviation from formula
(11.2). The mean value of formula (11.2) is determined
as follows.
mLi＝（1－λ）mD－m2T＋λmH ……………………(11.3)
Standard deviation of formula (11.2)
σLi2＝（1－λ）
2・σD2＋σ2T 2＋λ2σH 2 ……………(11.4)
In the case of master ring, due to σH 2=0 the formula
(11.4) is expressed as follows.
σLi2＝（1－λ）
2・σD2＋σ2T 2 …………………………(11.5)
The unknown values in formulas (11.3), (11.5) are only
m2T and σ2T 2. Hence, substitute the known numerical
values for formulas (11.3), (11.5) to determine m2T and
σ2T 2.
[2] Even when bearing ring is press-fitted in the housing
on actual machine, consider the inscribed circle
diameter similarly to the master ring press-fit.  
Herein, the calculation formulas for press-fit in the
housing on actual machine can be discriminated as
follows from formula (11.3), (11.4) by adding " ' " to
each formula.
mLi'＝（1－λ'）mD－m2T＋λ'mH' …………………(11.6)
σLi'2＝（1－λ'）
2・σD2＋σ2T 2＋λ'2σH'2 …………(11.7)
[3] For m2T and σ2T 2 in formula (11.6), (11.7), substitute
the values determined previously for the respective
formula. 
[4] From the calculations, the inscribed circle diameter in
press-fitting in the housing on actual machine can be

……………………………………(11.8)
[5] Radial internal clearance can be determined
considering the mean value and standard deviation of
shaft in formulas (11.6), (11.7). 
[6] The aiming radial internal clearance value is generally
set up so an ordinary clearance can be got. However,
the recommended clearance values are available
every the individual portions in the case of bearing
application to automobile. Feel free to contact NTN for

11.3.2 Track load capacity of cam follower and roller
follower
The reference hardness (reference tensile stress) was
set up from the relationship between the follower
hardness and net tensile stress of the material and the
track load capacity was determined
from the relationship of the setup reference stress to
hertz stress.
How to set up the reference hardness (tensile stress)
differs a little bit depending on each bearing
manufacturer. Herein, the relevant Table appended to
"JIS Handbook for Irons and Steels" was used as the
hardness - tensile stress relationship.
(Approximate numerical value under JIS Z8413
Revised Conversion Table)  
For HRC40, σ= 1.245MPa (127kgf/mm2) was adopted
as the reference hardness (tensile stress). 
<Track load capacity adjustment factor> 
The tensile stress strength of the follower material
increases with increase of its hardness, and the track
load capacity of the follower increases incurred by
increase of the tensile strength strength. In this case, the
load capacity increase rate can be determined by
multiplying the track load capacity by applicable track
load capacity adjustment factor shown in Table 11.1.
Note) The track load capacity determined herein is based
on net tensile stress as the reference, not allowable
hertz stress. Generally stress (specific stress)
resulting in creep of follower material is greater than
the tensile stress. Particularly in the case of static
load, this track load capacity comes to a safety side
value.
[Ex.] Determination of load capacity Tc' of track with
certain hardness by use of track load capacity
adjustment factor.
Assuming track load capacity described in
Dimensions Table as Tc and track load capacity
adjustment factor at applicable hardness as G
respectively, the track load capacity Tc' can be
determined as follows.  
Tc'＝G・Tc
For hardness HRC50 at NATR15X,
Tc＝11 900N (1 220kgf)，
G＝1.987
∴Tc'＝1.987×11 900N (1 220kgf)
＝23 645N (2 424kgf)

11.3.3 Outer ring strength 
Generally any outer ring never breaks down as long as
the load acting it is a usual operating load. This
paragraph describes hereunder the strength calculation
method to be used when the outer ring strength under
shock load and heavy load is reviewed. 
The outer ring strength can be determined using the
formula given hereunder, assuming the respective outer
ring profiles as illustrated in Fig. 11.6.  In this case, the
outer ring rupture  strength means the bridged rupture
strength of roller.

Regarding how to set up breaking stress, in general
1760MPa (180kg/mm2) can be set up as the breaking
stress for bearing steel, but it is desirable to set up the
breaking strength with safety-side value (1170MPa
[120kgf/mm2]), where stress concentration is taken into
account.  Generally any outer ring never break down as
long as the load acting on it is usual operating load, but it
necessary to check the rupture structure of outer ring,
where shock load and heavy load act on it.

When load Fr acts on the center point of outer ring as

and consequently bending stress σ1 (deemed as tensile
stress) acts on the stud surface.  In addition to this
bending stress, tensile stress σ2 generates from screw
tightening because the stud itself is clamped to machine
body with nuts. The stud strength can be reviewed from
comparison of the sum (σ1 + σ2) of these two tensile

This needle roller and cage assembly is one of the
basic components for the needle roller bearing of a
construction wherein the needle rollers are fitted with a
cage so as not to separate from each other. The use of
this roller and cage assembly enables to design a
compact and lightweight construction by utilizing a shaft

or a housing as the direct raceway surface, without using
inner ring and outer ring. 
The needle rollers are guided by the cage more
precisely than the full complement roller type, hence
enabling high speed running of bearing. In addition, its
rigidity and load capacity are high for the specific space.

Inter-roller diameter deviation of needle rollers  
Inter-roller diameter deviation of needle rollers which
are built in one cage is within 2um. The respective
specified diameter tolerances for built-in needle rollers
are identified by identification colors on the package label,
as shown in Table 1. 
The standard identification colors marked on each label
are red, dark blue, blue, black and white, unless
otherwise specially indicated.  
Where two or more bearings are used in tandem, those
of same identification color must be used for equal
distribution of bearing load.
Radial Clearance 
When a shaft and a housing are used as the direct
raceway surface, the radial clearance is determined by
the shaft diameter and the housing hole dimension.
Where the diameter tolerances for needle rollers are
standard (tolerances color-identified in red, dark blue,
blue, black, white), the shaft diameters and housing hole
dimensions shown in Table 2 are used. 
Shaft and housing specifications
Where a shaft and a housing are used as the direct
raceway surface, the raceway surface must meet the
specifications described in Table 3.
Bearing installation related dimensions  
The tolerances for the nominal dimension  "Bc" of cage
specified in Table 4 are recommended as the guide width
b of cage.

NTN
These needle roller and cage assemblies are
specially designed so as to be adaptable to the
operating environmental conditions for the connecting
rods of small and medium reciprocal engines and
compressors. 
The connecting rods are used under a severe
operating condition wherein acting load magnitude and
Needle Roller and Cage Assemblies for connecting rod bearings
direction fluctuate rapidly as well as under an high
temperature and strict lubrication environment.
Therefore, special measures are manly undertaken for
the cage structure, material and machining method so
that the needle roller and cage assemblies are

Type KBK is intended to guide inner
ring, which of the guide surface is
designed as long as possible to
thereby reduce the surface pressure.
In addition, the roller length is so
designed as to be maximum against
the width of connecting rod, for high
load capacity.  On the other hand,
Type V･･S intended for outer ring

Radial clearance
Table 1 shows the recommended clearance values
though the radial clearance differs depending on bearing
clearance, load, revolutions and ambient temperature. 
The proper radial clearance can be got by proper
selection and combination of roller diameter, connecting
rod hole diameter and pin diameter. Table 2 shows the
examples of selection and combination of those.
Connecting rod and pin specifications
Connecting rod (bore surface), crank pin and piston pin
(outer surface) can be used as direct raceway surface.
However, these surfaces must be resistible to great load
while maintaining high accuracy. For that, connecting
rods and pins acting as the direct raceway surface must
comply with the specifications specified hereunder.  
Any connecting rods shall be made of cement steel,
e.g. chrome molybdenum steel (SCM415, etc.), nickel
chrome molybdenum steel (SNCM420, etc.) and any
crank pins and piston pins shall also be made of cement
steel, e.g. chrome steel (SCr420, etc.), all of which shall
be surface-hardened by carburizing. 
The surface hardness of each shall range from HRC58
to 64 and adequate depth of effective carburizing-
hardened layer shall be secured up to Hv550. The depth
of effective carburizing-hardened layer differs depending
on actual load and pin diameter.  
Feel free to contact NTN for the more detailed
information.

Needle roller and cage assemblies for connecting rod bearings

Regulation to connecting rod
Two methods are available as follows to regulate axial
motion of a connecting rod; one method is to make
smaller a clearance between the rod and crank web at
large end side (Method of regulating at large end side)
and another method is to narrow a clearance between the
rod and piston boss at the small end side (Method of
regulating at small end side).  
In general, the method of regulation at large end side is
mostly adopted to get accurate motion of a connecting
rod. 
On the other hand, the method of regulation at small
end side is adopted when regulation at large end side
disables to secure good lubrication to the bearing and the
guide surface at large end side due to short connecting
rod and comparatively high revolutions. 
Regulation at large end side
This method regulates axial motion of a connecting rod
by forming a sliding surface between the large end of the
connecting rod and the side face of crank web. For the
use of this method, however, the connecting rod must be
provided, on its bore surface, with oil hole, slot and oil
groove to feed lubrication oil in and onto the bearing and
guide surface at large end side. 
The crank web end face shall be surface-hardened as
necessary or otherwise a side washer of copper alloy or
hardened steel shall be fitted on the guide surface. 
On the other hand, the needle roller and cage
assembly at small end side shall be guided in axial
direction by the side face of piston boss.  A great play
shall be secured between the piston boss and the
connecting rod. 
Regulation at small end side
This method regulates axial motion at the small end
face of a connecting rod and the side face of a piston rod.
Generally a connecting rod is not provided with oil groove
and slot to lubricate the guide surface at small end side,
but on occasion it is surface-hardened and uses a side
washer. 
Usually a connecting rod shall be provided with a
through-hole (at its small end side) to lubricate the
bearing unit. 
On the other hand, at the large end side a free
clearance exists between the connecting rod and the
crank web and, therefore, generally special measures
such as oil groove to lubricate, etc. 
may be omitted.

Drawn cup needle roller bearings
NTN
This bearing type is composed of an outer ring drawn
from a thin steel plate by precision drawing, needle rollers
and a cage assembled in the outer ring after the raceway
surface thereof was hardened.  Of the bearings with outer
ring, this bearing type is a bearing with the smallest
section height which enables space-saving and cost-
saving.  
Drawn Cup Needle Roller Bearings
Usually design is so made as to use a shaft as the
direct raceway surface without using inner ring.  The
outer ring of this bearing type is of such a construction
that the needle rollers and the cage are not separated
from one another, so that the bearing is only press-fitted
in a rigid housing with proper fit torque.  Thus, this
bearing type needs no snap ring, etc. to fix itself in axial
direction and, in addition, is easy to handle.

Bearing Fits
It is common that drawn cup needle bearing is press-
fitted in a housing by shrinkage fit so post press-fit
inscribed circle diameter (Fw) comes to ISO Tolerance
Rang Class F8. The post press-fit inscribed circle
diameter (Fw) depends on the housing material and
rigidity. It is therefore desirable to decide the interference
based on the data measured in pre-testing. 
Where the housing rigidity is adequately high, the post
press-fit inscribed circle diameter (Fw) is secured in nearly
F8 range and nearly ordinary radial clearance can be got
by adopting the data of bearing fit in housing and on shaft
as shown in Table-1.
Accuracy of housing bore
Because of its thin-walled outer ring, the performance
of drawn cup needle roller bearing is greatly affected by
the dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy and bore
surface roughness of a housing in which the bearing is
press-fitted. To avoid such an inverse affect, the housing
bore(hole) must have the accuracy as specified in Table
2.  For the shaft accuracy refer to Subsection 7.3
"Accuracy of Shaft and Housing" (on page A-39).
Bearing installation
Any drawn cup needle roller bearings must be press-
fitted in the housing in specific position by holding a
specific jig in perfect contact with the mark-stamped side
face of the bearing, without fail. 
Further, hammering directly the bearing ring in
installing (press-fitting) is not allowed absolutely. In
installing, it is recommended to use a mandrel with O-ring
as illustrated in Fig.1 as a press-fitting jig.  The use of this
mandrel would enable to insert easily any drawn cup
needle bearing in a housing without risk of twisting and
fall-down. 
Drawn cup needle roller bearing needs no a snap ring
and a shoulder for positioning itself in a housing, but the
bearing must be press-fitted so carefully as not to
allow its side face to strike the shoulder for
preventing it from deforming, where press-fitted in a
housing with shoulder.
Oil hole dimension in outer ring
The outer rings of double-row (Tail code : ZW) needle
roller and cage assembly Type HK and Type BK are
provided with an oil hole to facilitate oil lubrication to the
bearing. Table 3 shows the nominal oil hole diameter.
The Type HCK for application to universal joints is fixed
to the joint yoke by caulking, using a special-purposed
assembler. Feel free to contact NTN for any inquiry about
the special-purposed assembler (IPH Machine).

Drawn cup needle roller bearings
NTN
Table 4  Dimensional tolerance for inscribed circle diameter (Type HK and BK)
Table 5  Dimensional tolerance for inscribed circle diameter (Type HMK)
Bearing Tolerances and Measuring Methods  
The outer ring of drawn cup needle roller bearing is so
thin-walled that deformation thereof to a certain extent is
unavoidable in the manufacturing processes, particularly
in the heat-treating process. However, the outer ring is so
designed that it is reformed normally from such
deformation when being press-fitted in a housing with
specific dimensional accuracy and, as a result, it can
have the accuracy required to fulfill its specific function. 
Hence, it is meaningless to measure the
dimensional accuracy of bearing itself before being
press-fitted. So, the following measuring method is
used; a bearing to be measured is press-fitted in a
linkage of specific dimension (20mm or more in wall
thickness) and thereafter the inscribed circle
diameter (Fw) is measured using a plug gauge or a
taper gauge to evaluate the bearing accuracy.  
Tables 4 to 7 show the dimensional tolerances for the
bore diameter of each ring gauge and the inscribed circle
diameter (Fw) each of standard metric series drawn cup
needle roller bearings Type HK and BK, heavy load
series Type HMK (metric series), inch series Type DCL,
and inch series HCK for application to universal joints.
When measuring the inscribed circle diameter of roller,
the low tolerance for the inscribed circle diameter shall be
applied to the dimension at  "GO" side and the value of
the high tolerance for the inscribed circle diameter plus
(+) 2μm shall be applied to the dimension at "NOT GO"
side in compliance with the relevant ISO standard.

Machined Ring Needle Roller Bearings

Machined ring needle roller bearings
NTN
The machined ring of this bearing type contains needle
rollers and a cage. And the outer ring and the needle
rollers are inseparable from each other by means of
double-side ribs on the outer ring or side plates.
Because of its machined (solid) outer ring enabling to
make it more rigid and to thereby upgrade the bearing
accuracy, this bearing type is suitable for an application
Machined Ring Needle Roller Bearings
requiring high speed, high load and high running
accuracy. These machined ring needle roller bearings are
available in two types -- one without inner ring and
another with inner ring -- considering the case of using a
shaft as the direct raceway surface without using inner
ring.

Bearing Tolerances 
The dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy and
running accuracy of machined ring needle roller bearings
are specified in JIS B 1514 (Accuracy of Rolling
Bearings). (Refer to Section 4 "Bearing Tolerances",
Table 4.3 on page A-26.) Although the accuracy of NTN
standard bearings conforms to JIS Class-0, NTN can also
supply bearings conforming to JIS Class-6, -5 and -4. 
Feel free to contact NTN for the further detail of these
bearings. 
The dimensional tolerances for the roller inscribed
circle diameters (Fw) of bearing type NK, RNA and MR
conform to ISO Tolerance Range Class-F6. Refer to this
ISO Tolerance Class 
in selecting shaft diameter and radial clearance.
Radial clearance and bearing fits 
NTN machined ring needle roller bearings (with inner
ring) are all manufactured within the radial clearance
range specified in Table 5.1 of Subsection 5.1 "Radial
Clearance in Bearings" (page A-30). Because of the
narrow non-interchangeable clearance range, the
bearings shipped after adjusted to a specific non-
interchangeable clearance must be installed with the
clearance remained unchanged. 
The respective dimensional tolerances for shaft and
housing bore sizes on/in which bearing with inner ring is
press-fitted are per Table 6,3 of 6.4 "Recommended
Bearing Fits" (page A-34) which specifies them
according to load characteristic, load magnitude, and
shaft and housing bore sizes.The profile accuracy and

surface roughness of shaft and housing to be applied are
as specified in Table 7.3 of 7.3 "Shaft and Housing
Accuracy" (page A-39). 
A shaft is used as the direct raceway surface for a
bearing without inner ring and, in this case, the shaft
diameter (raceway diameter) tolerance is per Table 1
specifying the tolerances according to each running
clearance. And K7 tolerance generally in broad use is
applied as the dimensional tolerance for the housing
bore. Feel free to contact NTN for application of housing
bore tolerance other than K7.  
For the profile accuracy, surface roughness and
hardness of a shaft acting as the raceway surface, refer
to Table 7.4 of 7.4 "Raceway Surface Accuracy"(page
A-39). 
Dimension of oil hole in outer ring  
The outer ring is provided with an oil hole and an oil
groove to facilitate oil lubrication to bearing.  (but
excluding Type NK with roller inscribed circle diameter
(Fw) of 12mm and less.) 
Table 2 shows the oil hole dimension every outer ring
diameter.
Mounting relations 
In the case of raceway with an oil hole, the bearing
must be installed so the oil hole locates within the non-
load area. In addition, any bearing with inner ring must be
used within the allowable stroking value (s) (with the
rollers retained within the effective contact length range of
inner ring). 
For the allowable stroking value (s), refer to Fig. 1 and
applicable "Dimensions Table". 
The inner ring and outer ring of machined ring needle
roller bearing must be positioned in axial direction by
shoulder or snap ring in this case. For the shoulder
dimension and corner roundness (ra) of the shaft and the
housing are as specified in applicable "Dimensions
Table".

Machined ring needle roller bearings, separable Type
NTN
The machined ring of this bearing type has no rib or
side plate and, hence, the outer ring and the needle roller
and cage assembly are separable from each other. 
The outer ring can’t regulate axial displacement of the
needle roller and cage assembly and, therefore, the
bearing construction must be so designed that the needle
roller and cage assembly can be guided by a shaft or a
housing.  Furthermore, the outer ring, the needle roller

Bearing with tail code T2 uses a
polyamide resin cage and,
therefore, it shall be used at
allowable temperature 120˚C and,
under continuous running, at
100˚C and less.  
For an application requiring high
running accuracy, manufacture of
the bearings conforming to JIS
Class-6, -5 and -4 is also available
on special request.

and cage assembly separable from one another, and the
inner ring can be press-fitted individually in a shaft or a
housing. This could facilitate the bearing mounting work.  
This bearing type is suitable for an application requiring
high running accuracy because the resultant radial
clearance can be retained in a narrow range by selection
and combination of appropriate inner ring, outer ring and
needle roller and cage assembly.

Machined ring needle roller bearings, separable Type
NTN
Table 1  Oil hole dimension    
Accuracy of bearing
The dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy and
running accuracy of machined ring needle roller bearing,
separate type (with inner ring) are specified in JIS B 1514
(Accuracy of Rolling Bearings). (Refer to Table 4.3 of
Section 4. "Bearing Tolerances" on page A-26.)
Although the accuracy of NTN standard bearings
conforms to JIS Class-0, NTN can also supply bearings
conforming to JIS Class-6, -5 and -4. Feel free to contact
NTN for the further detail of these bearings.
The dimensional tolerances for the roller inscribed
circle diameters (Fw) of the bearing type without inner ring
conform to ISO Tolerance Range Class-F6.  The outer
ring and the needle roller and cage assembly are
supplied in set and, therefore, the bearing must be
installed with the combination of these two in set
remained unchanged. 
Particularly when high bearing accuracy is required, a
bearing with grinding allowance for its inner ring raceway
surface can be supplied upon request from a client. In
that case, however, the client is requested to finish the
inner ring to the intended dimension after having installed
on a shaft.  
Radial clearance and bearing fits
Table 5.1 of Subsection 5.1 "Radial Clearance in
Bearings" (page A-30) shows the radial clearance of
bearings with inner ring.  Because of the narrow non-
interchangeable clearance range, the bearings shipped
after adjusted to a specific non-interchangeable clearance
must be installed with the clearance remained
unchanged.
The respective fitting tolerances for shaft and housing
bore on/in which bearing with inner ring is press-fitted are
per Table 6.3 of 6.4 "Recommended Bearing Fits"
(page A-34) which specifies them according to load
characteristic, load magnitude, and shaft and housing
bore sizes. 
The profile accuracy and surface roughness of shaft
and housing to be applied are as specified in Table 7.3 of
7.3 "Shaft and Housing Accuracy" (page A-39).
A shaft is used as the direct raceway surface for a
bearing without inner ring and, in this case, the shaft
diameter (raceway diameter) tolerance is per Table 1
specifying the tolerances according to each running
clearance. And K7 tolerance generally in broad use is
applied as the dimensional tolerance for the housing
bore. Feel free to contact NTN for application of housing
bore tolerance other than K7.
For the profile accuracy, surface roughness and
hardness of a shaft acting as the raceway surface, refer
to Table 7.4 of 7.4 "Raceway Surface Accuracy" (page
A-39).

Dimension of oil hole in outer ring
The outer ring of bearing Type ZW is provided with an
oil hole and an oil groove to facilitate oil lubrication to
bearing.
Table 1 shows the oil hole dimension every outer ring
diameter. 
Mounting relations 
The inner ring and outer ring of any machined ring
needle roller bearing, separable type must both be
positioned in axial direction by shoulder or a snap ring. 
For the shoulder dimension and corner roundness (ra)
of the shaft and the housing are as specified in applicable
"Dimensions Table".  The cage must be guided by the
shaft or the side face of the housing shoulder, but the
guide surface must be finished by, at least, grinding for
deburring.

Inner Rings
Many of the needle roller bearings use a shaft as the
direct raceway surface without using inner ring. However,
it is recommended to use any of the inner rings described
hereunder, together with needle roller bearing, where
applicable shaft can not be surface-hardened and
surface-finished by grinding.  Any inner rings are made of
high carbon chrome bearing steel and finished by
grinding after heat-treated. 
It is desirable to use an inner ring of wide width, where
the axial displacement of a shaft is great and also a seal
is used at the outer side of bearing.
Types and Designs
NTN inner rings are available in both of IR type with
boundary dimensions of metric system and MI type with
boundary dimensions of inch system. The both ends of
inner ring raceway are chamfered in taper form to
facilitate fitting of the inner ring.  On the other hand, any
inner rings with an asterisk ※-mark are fine-chamfered
so as to allow greater axial displacement.  In addition to
these inner rings, manufacture of special inner ring type
(with tail code: D) with oil hole on its center is also
available.
Particularly where high running accuracy is required, on
occasion the raceway surface of inner ring is finished by
grinding after fitted on a shaft. In such a case, an inner
ring with grinding allowance for its raceway can be
supplied. Feel free to contact NTN for the detail of such
an inner ring.
Composition of nominal number
Nominal number comprises type code (IR or MI),
dimension code [bore dia. (d)×raceway dia. (F)×width
(B)] and tail code.
The dimension of inch series MI type is expressed at
the unit of 1/16 inch.
Inner Rings
Dimensional accuracy for inner ring
The dimensional accuracy (bore diameter "d", width "B"
and chamfer dimension "rs min"), profile accuracy and
running accuracy of the inner rings are as shown in
Tables 4.3 and 4.5 of Section 4 "Bearing accuracy"
(page A-26).  And the standard accuracy class of these
items conforms to JIS Class-0, but other inner rings
conforming to JIS Class-5 and -4 are also offerable on
request.
For the dimensional tolerance for raceway diameter (F)
shown in applicable Dimension Table, the inner ring is
finished so the radial clearance comes to ordinary
clearance (refer to Table 5.1 of 5.2 "Running clearance"
(page A-30) when it is combined with needle rollers.
Feel free to contact NTN for use of an inner ring
subjected to radial clearance other than ordinary
clearance.

Note 1) Dimensional tolerance to secure ordinary clearance when any of these inner rings is combined with needle roller bearing with no inner ring. 
2) Allowable minimum chamfer dimension r .
Remarks: 1. Nominal number plus code "D" represents inner ring with oil hole.
2. Nominal number plus ※-mark represents inner ring with fine-chamfered outer surface.

Adjustable-Clearance Needle Roller Bearings

B-134
Clearance-adjustable needle roller bearings
NTN
This bearing type comprises a solid outer ring with
special machined section and needle rollers and cage
built in the outer ring.  The outer ring, needle rollers and
cage are inseparable from each other. The raceway
diameter of the outer ring is shrunk and the roller
inscribed circle diameter (Fw) is reduced correspondingly
by pressing the outer ring in axial direction.
Clearance-Adjustable Needle Roller Bearings
The radial clearance is fine-adjustable by an load to be
applied to the bearing in axial direction, that is, axial
shrinkage of the outer ring.  This bearing type is mainly
applied to the work spindle of a machine tool etc. which
require high running accuracy, whose accuracy class is
JIS Class-4.
RNA 49 05 S
φ30～φ125
φ25～φ110
The dimensional accuracy, profile
accuracy and running accuracy
conform to JIS Class-4 so as to be
available for applications requiring
high running accuracy. 
Another inner ring type with
grinding allowance for its raceway
surface can also be supplied upon
request.

Bearing accuracy 
Application of this bearing type is limited to the portions
of a machine which require high running accuracy.
Therefore, the dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy
and running accuracy of this bearing type conform to JIS
Class-4. Higher running accuracy can be achieved by
finishing the inner ring raceway surface with grinding
allowance by grinding, after the inner ring was press-fitted
on a shaft.  Feel free to contact NTN for the more detailed
information.   
Radial clearance and bearing fits 
The Type NA49･･S with inner ring has a radial
clearance smaller than the specific ordinary clearance,
while the radial clearance of Type RNA49･･S without
inner ring is determined by shaft diameter being selected
per applicable "Dimensions Table" which specifies the
dimensional tolerances for the roller inscribed circle
diameter (Fw). 
The outer ring must be fitted in a housing by "close fit"
or "tight fit" (interference of approximately 5μm) to shrink
the raceway diameter by pressing the outer ring in axial
direction. 
Bearing fit on a shaft and in a housing shall be per
Table 1.

Shaft and housing accuracy  
This bearing type which is applied to the portions of a
machine requiring high running accuracy is clamped with
the outer ring inclination in installing restrained as less as
possible. Therefore, the profile accuracy of the shaft and
the housing must be made higher than that for general
machined ring needle roller bearings. (Table 2)

How to adjust radial clearance  
The ratio of outer ring axial shrinkage to shrinkage of
roller inscribed circle diameter (Fw) is nearly 3:1. In other
words, the outer ring must be tightened by 3 mm in axial
direction to make the radial clearance smaller by 1 mm. 
For adjustment of the radial clearance, the outer ring
must be tightened uniformly in parallel to the shaft center.
In the case of adjustment by the method illustrated in
Fig.1, a specific axial tightening value can be obtained by
changing the thickness of a spacer, which was inserted
between the housing and the lid, by lapping the spacer or
replacing it with another spacer.  In the case of
adjustment by the method illustrated in Fig.2, the fixed
ring 2 is fitted in the housing and, thereafter, the threaded
lid 1 is screwed in until it comes in contact with the outer
ring for zero setting. Then, the threaded lid 1 is further
screwed in by the required value, after the fixed ring was
loosened, and thereafter the fixed ring 2 is retightened.
Further, it is recommended to use a saw-toothed
tightening screw as illustrated in Fig. 3 because
accuracy-down can be minimized by use of such a screw.

Complex Bearings
Complex bearings
NTN
NTN complex bearing is composed of a radial needle
roller bearing to support radial load and a thrust ball
bearing or a thrust roller bearing to support axial load
which are integrated into one bearing unit. Comparing
with individual use of a radial bearing and a thrust bearing
for the same purpose, this complex bearing saves the
required installation space and thereby can contribute to
making the overall construction of an equipment more
compact.

Integral thrust plate 
With dust-proof cover
This type is identical to NKZ, but its thrust bearing is
provided with dust-proof cover to prevent grease scattering. 
Furthermore, the handling characteristic is good because
the dust-proof cover makes the thrust plate non-separable
integral. 
Due to the use of needle roller bearing as its thrust bearing,
this type can support greater axial load than NKX.  
This type is identical to NKXR, but its thrust bearing is
provided with dust-proof cover to prevent grease scattering.
Furthermore, the handling characteristic is good because
the dust-proof cover makes the thrust plate non-separable
and integral.  
This type is composed of needle roller bearing and angular
bearing which were integrated into one unit. The angular
bearing supports axial load. Hence, this type can support
one-way axial load only. Best-suited to high speed and light
load application. 
This type is composed of needle roller bearing and
three-point contact angular bearing which were integrated
into one unit. Unlike KN1A, this type can support
bi-directional axial load.
This type is a special-purposed bearing to support a
precision ball screw.  This type uses the side face of the
radial bearing as the raceway surface of thrust bearing. 
This can support axial load from both directions.  
This type is a special-purposed bearing to support a
precision ball screw. This can support bi-directional axial
load. This type is identical to AXN, but its axial load capacity
is greater.

Calculation of rated life  
The rated life (L) of any complex bearing is determined
as follows. Determine individually the rated life (Lr) of
radial needle roller bearing from radial load acting thereon
and the rated life (La) of thrust bearing from axial load
acting thereon. And determine the rated life (L) from
these determined rated lives (Lr, La) using the following
formula
Bearing Accuracy
Regarding the dimensional tolerances for radial needle
roller bearing, refer to Table 4.3 of 4. "Bearing
Tolerances" (page A-26) for others than the
characteristics described in Dimensions Table and to
Table 4.4 (page A-26) for thrust bearing tolerances
respectively.  Manufacture of bearing Type AXN and
ARN is limited to those of JIS accuracy class-5 and -4
only. (Allowable radial run-out values for Type AXN and
ARN is as specified in Table 1.) 
Life La of thrust bearing
Life Lr of radial bearing
Radial clearance 
The respective radial clearances of Type NKX+IR,
NKXR+IR, NKIA and NKIB shall comply with the
interchangeable clearances specified in Table 5.1 (1) of
5.1 "Radial Clearances of Bearings" (page A-30).  The
standard bearings are manufactured subject to the
regular clearances.
The radial clearances of Type AXN and ARN is special
clearance, as specified in applicable Dimensions Table. 
Bearing fits  
Radial needle roller bearings shall be fitted on shaft/in
housing in compliance with Table 2. The thrust bearing
washers of Type NKX and NKXR shall be fitted in a
housing with hole diameter larger by 0.5mm or over than
the washer outer diameter D1 or D2.  For Type NKIA and
NKIB it is not allowed to make the interference greater
than k5/M6.

NTN Yoke Type Track Rollers is the rolling
mechanisms whose outer ring rolls on a track. For
example, these track rollers are applied to eccentric roller,
guide roller, rocker arm roller, cam roller and pressure
roller. For that, the outer ring is designed to such a wall
thickness as to be resistible to high load and shock load.
Both of spherical outer surface (rolling surface) and
cylindrical outer surface are available for the outer ring.
The spherical outer ring can damp edge-load acting on
the contact surface between the track and the track roller,
while the cylindrical outer ring (Tail code: X)  has track
load capacity greater than the spherical outer ring.

¡Labyrinth is formed between the outer ring and the thrust washer.
¡Greater rated load, best-suited to applications subjected to high load and shock load.  
¡A steel plate is press-fitted in the outer ring to form labyrinth between the plate and  
　the side plates at both sides of the inner ring, whereby the required sealing 
　performance is secured and the side plates are held so as not to separate from 
　one another. 
¡The inner ring and the side plates are tightened together in axial direction for
　 non-clearance. 
¡The outer ring is guided in axial direction by the outer ring ribs and the end faces of  
　cylindrical roller.  
Particularly Type NUTW provides the following features. 
¡The greatest rated load, of the roller followers. 
¡Due to the outer ring with inner ribs, this type is excellently resistible to axial load and 
　moment load and, in addition, runs smoothly, though depending on actual 
　operatingconditions. 
¡Good lubrication effect and longer life are expectable by increasing thegrease fill volume.

Bearing Tolerances  
The respective dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy
and running accuracy of the bearing bore diameter (d),
cylindrical roller outer diameter (D), and outer ring width
(C) are as shown in Table 4.3 of Section 4. "Bearing
Accuracy" (page A-26). (Conforming to JIS Accuracy
Class-0) 
On the other hand, the dimensional tolerances for
spherical roller outer diameter (D) and the roller inscribed
circle diameter (FW) of Type RNA22 are as shown in
applicable Dimensions Table.  
Bearing fits and radial clearance    
The tolerance range class of shaft against bearing with
inner ring shall be g6 (h6) and, where a shaft is used as
the direct raceway surface (Type RNA22), the tolerance
range class of the shaft shall be k5 (k6). In general, the
outer ring is not fitted in a housing. Mounting relations

(1) The side face height in the roller follower mount must
be made larger than “e” dimension described in
applicable Dimensions Table. (Fig.1)  In mounting,
chamfer the mounting surface at R as small as
possible (around 0.5×45˚) and bring the inner ring
and the end face of side plate in precise contact with
one another.

For D and e dimensions refer to applicable Dimensions Table. 
(2) Where the roller follower is mounted, locate the inner
ring oil hole within the non-load area (load free side).
(Fig. 2) 
If the oil hole locates within the load area, it would
cause shorter life.
(3) Type NA･･22LL and RNA22 are of separable type
and, hence, the outer ring is guided by flange or thrust
washer mounted on shaft (pin). Therefore, the guide
surface must be finished more precisely than by lathe-
turning and deburred completely for surface
smoothing. In addition, when the guide surface is not
hardened the outer ring must be guided at A-
dimension shown in Fig.3.  When it is hardened, even
a little smaller guide surface can be used.
In assembling this bearing, it must be handled with
good care to protect the seal lip from bending and flaw.
Where any of NTN roller followers was stub-
mounted, non-uniform load (bias load) could act
on the bearing, inversely affected by fitting
loose arising from further continued running. 
Good care must be exercised of such fitting
loose, for stable running of the equipment.

The outer ring outer surface of bearing and
the track surface must both be lubricated.
Failure to lubricate could result earlier in
damage of the bearing.
Lubrication  
The roller followers with synthetic rubber seal (with tail
code : LL) and the full complement roller type followers
are filled up with lithium soap base grease so that they
can be used in the temperature range of -25 to +100˚C.
Lubricant feeding and replenishing into the bearing are
done through an oil hole provided on the inner ring. In this
case, the inner ring must be fitted so the oil hole locates
within non-load area. For the full complement roller type
roller followers NATV, NACV, NUTR and NUTW with no
cage, it is necessary to shorten the grease replenishing
interval.  
Further, a roller follower with cage and without seal is
not filled up with lubrication grease. When needing a
follower with grease-filled cage, feel free to contact NTN.
Track load capacity 
Statically allowable maximum radial load on the contact
surface of track to track roller is referred to as "track load
capacity", which differs depending on the track hardness.
The track load capacity described in applicable
Dimensions Table is subject to track hardness HRC40. If
the hardness value is other than HRC40, multiply the
track load capacity in the Dimensions Table by the
adjustment factor G in Table 2, for determining the track
load capacity.  However, the track load capacity shall be
C0r if the calculated track load capacity exceeds the basic
static load rating C0r of bearing.  
Refer to page A-55 for the detail.

Cam followers stud type truck rollers
NTN
This is a track roller complete with stud instead of inner
ring, which of the outer ring rolls on the track. These NTN
stud type track rollers are applied to eccentric roller, guide
roller, rocker arm roller, etc. similarly to the roller
followers.  One end of the stud is so threaded as to
facilitate mounting thereof. And the outer ring is guided in
Cam Followers (Stud Type Track Roller) 
axial direction by the side plates which are press-fitted in
the flange end of the stud and the stud itself. 
The outer ring has a thick wall and both of spherical
outer profile and cylindrical outer surface (tail code: X) are
available for it similarly to the outer ring of the roller
follower.

Fitting relations 
(1) Make the face height at the cam follower mount
greater than "e" dimension given in applicable
Dimension Table. (Fig.1) 
Furthermore, chamfer the stud mounting hole at R as
small as possible (around 0.5×45˚) and bring the side
faces of side face in precise contact.

(2) Don't hammer directly the cam follower rib. Doing
so would cause breakdown and rotation failure of
the rib.
(3) The oil hole position on the stud raceway surface is
shown with NTN mark stamped on the stud rib
surface. Mount the stud so the oil hole locates within
the non-load area (non-load side). (Fig. 3)  If the oil
hole locates within the load area, it would cause
shorter life of the follower.

Cam followers stud type truck rollers
NTN
(4) Particularly where loose of the mounting screw is
forecast due to wide amplitude vibration during
running, the mounting methods as illustrated in Fig. 4
are available. 
(5) The stud is subjected to bending stress and tensile
force arising from bearing load. Tighten the stud screws
with tightening torque which does not exceed the
torque value specified in applicable Dimension Table. 
Too tight tightening torque could result in rupture
of the threaded portion.  
(6) A hole is provided on the stud center at right angle to
the shaft axial center, as illustrated in Fig. 5.  Use this
hole for locking or grease replenishment.
How to feed and replenish grease  
Feed and replenish grease through a grease nipple
provided on the flange end face or threaded-side end
face of the stud.  In this case, plug the grease-feed hole
or the tapped hole at non-greasing side (with a special-
purposed plug or a threaded plug with hexagon socket.) 
These grease nipple and plug are enclosed in each
cam follower package. Screw-in them in specific position
before mounting the cam follower. 
Special grease nipple and that specified in JIS
Standard as applicable are available for use. The
dimensions thereof and the applicable bearing types are
as specified in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. 
Furthermore, special press-fit type plug and threaded
plug with hexagon socket are available for use. The
dimensions thereof and the applicable bearing types are
as specified in Tables 5-1, -2 and Table 6 respectively.
When using the special-purposed press-fit plug, press-
fit it in the grease feed hole using a mandrel of applicable
dimension shown in Table 7.
(7) For mounting and adjusting the eccentric stud type
cam follower, follow the sequence given hereunder. 
1. Insert the stud in the mounting hole so that the NTN
mark (showing oil hole position) locates in relative to
load acting direction as illustrated in Fig. 3. 
2. Turn the stud using the recessed slot for screwdriver
on the stud head or the accessory threaded plug with
hexagon socket, to adjust a clearance from the mating
contact surface. 
3. After adjustment, tighten the stud nut with specific
tightening torque described in applicable Dimensions
Table.
[a] Use JIS B 1181 Class-3
     thin type nut as double
     nut for tightening. 
[b] Use a specific washer
      with standard nut. 
Fig. 4
Fig. 5
NTN cam follower is generally stud-mounted so
that non-uniform load (bias load) could act on the
bearing, inversely affected by fitting loose arising
from continuous running. 
So, good care must be exercised of fitting loose
for stable running of an equipment. 
The outer ring outer surface of bearing and the
track surface must both be lubricated. Failure to
lubricate could result earlier in damage of bearing.
Lubrication and how to feed and replenish
grease into the follower 
Lubrication 
The cam follower type with synthetic rubber seal (with
tail code LL) and the full-complement roller type are pre-
filled up with lithium soap base grease so they can be
used in the operating temperature range of -25 to
+100˚C. 
The type with cage and with no seal is not filled up with
grease. If a grease pre-filled type is needed, feel free to
contact NTN. 
Further, NTN Bearings with Solid Drease using solid
lubricant of less leakage is also available on request. Feel
free to contact NTN for the detailed information.

Track load capacity  
Maximum radial load which is statically allowable on
the track roller to track contact surface is referred to as
"track load capacity", and the track load capacity subject
to track surface hardness HRC40 is as described in
applicable Dimensions Table.
Where the track surface hardness is other than HRD40,
adjust the track load capacity using the adjustment factor
shown in Table 11.1.

Note 1) For bearing with cylindrical outer surface, the nominal number is followed by "X" code.  In this case, the cylindrical bearing is manufactured with the tolerance for outer ring 
outer diameter D which conforms to JIS Class-0.  Ex. KR22XLL
2) Grease replenishing hole is provided at front side only (on left side-face in the above sketch). However, in the case with "hexagon hole" no grease replenishing hole is provided.

Thrust roller bearings
NTN
This thrust roller bearing composed of a thrust roller
and cage assembly, wherein needle rollers or cylindrical
rollers are configured radially in the cage, and a bearing
ring of disc form is intended to support one-directional
axial load. 
In mounting, it is possible to use a shaft or a housing
as the direct raceway surface without using the bearing
Thrust Roller Bearings
ring, whereby design of a low height and lightweight
compact construction is enabled.
This type of thrust roller bearing results in slipping on
raceway surface because theoretically it can’t roll
perfectly, but in most cases it is practically trouble-free
and can rotates at comparatively high speed.

Because of its 1mm thick steel plate ring, this
thrust bearing needs adequate rigidity and
profile accuracy of machine parts adjacent to
the bearing. 
As an individual, on occasion this thrust bearing
results in slight camber, but it is flattened when
specific thrust load acts thereon, having no
problem in practical use.

Bearing accuracy
The respective dimensional accuracy, profile accuracy
and running accuracy of thrust cylindrical roller bearings
811, 812 and 893 are as shown in Table 4.4 of Section 4
"Bearing Accuracy" (page A-28). 
The thrust roller and cage assemblies (AXK, K811,
K812, K893) are machined with dimensional tolerance
E11 for the bore diameter (De1) (E12 for bearing number
with T2 code) and with dimensional tolerance c12 for the
outer diameter (De) of Type AXK and a13 for the
diameter (De) of K811, K812 and K893. 
Raceway surface requirements:
Where the plane portion of a shaft/a housing is used as
the direct raceway surface of thrust roller and cage
assembly, the raceway surface must meet the
requirements specified as a guideline in Table 1.
Cage guiding 
The thrust roller and cage assemblies (AXK, K811,
K812 and K893) must be guided at either the bore side
(shaft side) or the outer surface side (housing side) for in-
running centering. 
In general, the bore-side guide of low relative speed
against the cage is mostly used. It should be used
particularly for high speed running. The dimensional
tolerances for shaft and housing, when the cage is guided
thereby, shall be h8 for shaft diameter (bore guide) and
H9 for housing bore diameter (outer surface guide)
respectively, which of the guide surface shall be fine-
finished by grinding.
Bearing fit in bearing ring
Table 2 shows the tolerances for fitting of the thrust
bearing rings (AS, WS and GS) on shaft or in housing.
Mounting related dimensions
The dimensions related to fitting of WS and GS bearing
rings on shaft and in housing are as described in
applicable Dimensions Table.  
The fitting surface of AS bearing ring must be flat and
have the rigidity sufficient to support thrust load
throughout its entire surface.

Needle rollers
NTN
NTN needle rollers are all made of high carbon chrome
bearing steel, fine-finished by grinding and polishing after
heat-treated, and the hardness thereof ranges from
HRC60 to 65. These needle rollers are supplied as not
only rolling element but also pin and shaft individuals. 
End face profile of needle roller 
F-type needle roller bearing with flat end face is
standard type, while A-type with round end face is semi-
standard type.  In addition to these two types, another
needle roller type (nominal number with tail code E)
capable of damping edge load is also available. Feel free
to contact NTN for the detail thereof.
Needle Rollers
Needle roller tolerances 
Any needle rollers are manufactured with dimensional
accuracy and profile accuracy conforming to JIS B 1506
(Rollers for Roller Bearings). (Table 2)
The needle rollers are delivered contained in same
package after the mutual deviation of diameter Dw was
assorted to 2μm and less.  Before being delivered, the
needle rollers are identified by label colors such as red,
dark blue, blue, etc. according to the respective
dimensional tolerances.  
Further, mixed use of needle rollers contained in
packages of different label colors is prohibited.

Needle rollers
NTN
Application of needle rollers  
When composing a full-complement roller type needle
roller bearing using standard needle rollers, shaft
diameter (d), housing hole diameter (D), circumferential
clearance (∆C)
and radial clearance (∆r) must be determined
respectively.  These can be calculated as follows from
needle roller diameter (Dw) and number of rollers (Z).
(Refer to Fig. 2)
Determine the minimum value of circumferential
clearance (∆C) using formula (1).  And select radial
clearance (∆r) according to applicable shaft diameter and
operating conditions, in reference to Table 5.1, as the
guideline, of 5.1 “Bearing Radial Clearance” (page A-
30).  In general, full-complement roller type bearing needs
radial clearance larger than that in needle roller and cage
assembly type roller bearing. 
∆C＝(0.005～0.020) ×Z mm (minimum value) (1)
Then, determine the minimum value of housing bore
diameter (D) and the maximum value of shaft diameter
(d) using the formulas (2) and (3).

The maximum value of housing bore diameter (D)
required to retain needle rollers in a housing by a
keystone can be determined from the minimum diameter
value (Dw min) of the roller and the number of rollers using
formula (4). The coefficient K to be used in that time is as
shown in Table 4.

Snap rings
NTN
These snap rings are used exclusively for fixing or
guiding a needle roller bearing ring or cage in axial
direction. Furthermore, these snap rings have the profile
identical to C-type concentric snap ring specified in JIS B
2806 and, in addition, snap rings with smaller section
height (b) and also available in smaller dimension range
are manufactured according to application of needle roller
bearings.  These snap rings are manufactured using hard
steel wire rod and, after manufactured, chemical
conversion treatment is applied to the surface thereof.  
Types of snap ring  
Two types of snap ring are available; one is Type WR
designed for application to shaft and another is Type BR
for application to bearing housing. 
Snap Rings
Composition of nominal number
The snap ring nominal number is composed of type
code (WR or BR) and dimension code. The dimension
code represents applicable shaft diameter in Type WR
and applicable housing bore diameter in Type BR.
Allowable running speed
The allowable running speed for Type WR for shaft
application is as described in applicable Dimensions
Table. This means the running speed when snap ring
begins to get loose with opening of its cut ends.
Mounting relation 
It is recommended to insert a spacer between snap ring
and cage for guiding the cage in axial direction. On
occasion, snap ring is difficult to remove, but limited to a
portion in which a pull-out
tool can not be inserted easily. In such a case, it is
necessary to consider the use of general snap rings
specified in JIS B 2804 (C-type snap rings) or B 2806 (C-
type concentric snap rings).

Seals
NTN
Seals   
These are the special-purposed seals for needle roller
bearings whose cross sectional height is designed so
small as to match applicable needle roller bearings.
These contact seals are made of synthetic rubber
reinforced with steel plate, being then used in operating
temperature range of -25 to +120˚C and, under
continuous running, at 100˚C and less.  Further, feel free
to contact NTN for the use of these seals under special
operating condition, e.g. operating temperature of over
120˚C. 
Types of seal
Two different seal types are available; one is Type G
with one lip and another is Type GD with two lips. In
addition to these two, sliding rubber seals (LEG, LEGD),
wherein lubrication property was assigned to a rubber
material fulfilling low torque under an non-lubrication
environment, are also manufactured. Feel free to contact
NTN for the detail of these seal types.

Type code

Fig. 3
Fig. 1  Type G (LEG)
Fig. 2  Type GD (LEGD)
Where seal contact surface and lubricating condition
are good, Type G with one lip can be used up to 10m/s
maximum at peripheral speed and Type GD with two lips
used up to 6m/s maximum.
This seal is intended to hold grease and to
prevent dust invasion from outside. It has no
function to hold lubrication oil, etc. unlike oil
seal.
Composition of nominal number 
Nominal seal number is composed of type code (G,
GD) and dimension code (bore dia.×outer dia.×width).
Fitting relations
The seal contact surface must be finished by grinding,
after hardened, to get its good sealing performance. In
addition, harmful flaw and indent are not allowed to exist
on the seal contact surface. Where the inner ring raceway
surface is used as seal contact surface, a wide inner ring
must be used. 
When fitting a seal in a bearing, it is desirable to taper
the shaft end face or the housing end face so as to
protect the seal lip and outer surface from damaging, as
illustrated in Fig. 4. Where shaft end is not tapered or
chamfered (rounded), it is recommended to a fitting jig as
illustrated in Fig.5.  Regarding the seal to housing
interference, a adequate interference can be got in the
usual housing tolerance range of G7 toR7.  
Furthermore, it is recommended to apply pre-coat
of a lubricant to the seal lip before fitting seals G and
GD, for better lubrication.  Further, when fitting a seal
and inserting it through a shaft, take good care to
protect its lip from deforming. 
Seal application examples  
Figs.6 to 8 illustrate design examples using these seals.

Due to its resin cage, this bearing shall be used at allowable
temperature 90˚C and, under continuous running, at 80˚C
and less. The double-row type has an elastic joint on the cage
center so double rows of flat rollers can be bent to any
optional angle along the elastic joint by heating them in oil of
70 to 90˚C. By cooling down the double-row rollers with the
bent angle held unchanged for several seconds after having
bent them to any optional angle, the bent shape of the double
rows can be held unchanged so that the double-row rollers
can be mounted on a V-shaped surface as illustrated.  
Where the resin cage RF is used, the bearing shall be used at
allowable temperature 90˚C and, under continuous running, at
80˚C and less.  
The standard length of the bearing unit with BF cage is
1000 mm. 
The standard length of the bearing unit with RF cage is 705 mm.
Two or more bearings of this type can’t be jointed with each
other, but it can be supplied at any desired length on request. 
The operating temperature shall be held within the range of
-25 to 100˚C, to prevent deterioration of seal and grease.

Linear Ball Bearings, Solid and Drawn Cup Types  
Four to nine rows of balls are configured equally in the
outer ring (outer cylinder). The ball rows circulate in axial
direction while being guided by the cage. Thus, these
bearing types move infinitely on a shaft in axial direction.
However, these bearing types can't rotate.

Dimensional accuracy 
The respective accuracy of the boundary dimensions ,
inscribed circle diameter (Fw) , outer diameter (D), and
width (C) of Type KLM (solid type bearing) are as
described in applicable Dimensions Table. Same bearing
with higher dimensional accuracy is offerable on special
request. Feel free to contact NTN when such a bearing is
needed.  
For Type KH (drawn cup type), its outer ring is so thin-
walled that it deforms inevitably to some extent in the
manufacturing processes, particularly heat-treating
process, but it is so designed as to be restored normally
from such deformation and fulfill its specific function with
the required accuracy by being press-fitted in a housing
with the required dimensional accuracy.
Feel free to contact NTN for the method of measuring
the dimensional accurracy.
Bearing fit  
The use of a shaft or a housing with the dimensional
tolerance shown in Table 1 would ensure proper radial
clearance.  Where further small radial clearance is
wanted or preload is applied, the radial clearance is
adjusted using a split housing or otherwise bearing fit
required for smaller clearance or preload is selected.
Shaft and housing requirements  
Any shaft /housing on/in which these bearing types are
fitted must meet the requirements specified in Table 2.
How to mount  
The housing for Type KLM (solid type) canﾕt be fixed
perfectly with interference only and, therefore, must be
fixed in axial direction using a snap ring.  
On the other hand, Type KH (drawn cup type) needs
no axial fixing by a snap ring because it is press-fitted in a
housing with interference. For press-fitting, press the
outer ring at its stamped mark side(hardened side) using
a mandrel illustrated in Fig.2.
Accessories  
Shafts, shaft support stands and housings exclusive for
NTN linear ball bearings are also offerable. Feel free to
contact NTN for the detailed information.

Linear ball bearings, stroke type
NTN
The bearing cage with multiple ball rows (several balls
per row) configured circumferentially therein can move
within the outer ring in both circumferential and axial
directions. Thus, this bearing type can rotate and
reciprocate (but at a limited stroke) on a shaft. 
Bearing construction  
Maximum available length of the reciprocal stroke is
two times as long as the stroke at which the cage can
reciprocate within the outer ring. The outer ring is
provided at its both ends with a snap ring acting as a
stopper and a wave spring is provided between the snap
ring and the cage to damp a shock acting on the cage as
well as to prevent wear of the cage.  
In addition to the standard type, a special type with
synthetic rubber seal (Tail code: LL) on the both ends of
its outer ring is also available.

Bearing fit and radial clearance  
Any linear ball bearings must be used with radial
clearance as less as possible. Particularly where linear
ball bearing is applied to a vertical shaft or high accuracy
is required, it is desirable to select and combine
appropriate bearing and shaft for securing radial
clearance in the range of 0 to -10μm (by preloading).
Table 2 shows the bearing fits on shaft and in housing.

How to mount  
This bearing type can't be fixed perfectly to a housing
with interference only and, therefore, it is fixed in axial
direction using a snap ring. (Refer to Fig. 1)

For adjusting the cage so it locates at the outer ring
center after a shaft was mounted, push the cage in the
arrow direction in Fig. 2 by inserting the shaft into the
outer ring that was press-fitted in the housing. (Fig. 2)  
In this condition, insert slowly the shaft up to the center
point of the reciprocating stroke and, thereafter, further
push-in the shaft by 1/2 of the stroke. (Fig. 3)  Then,
return the shaft by 1/2 of the stroke to thereby locate the
cage at the outer ring center and the shaft at the center
point of the reciprocating stroke. (Fig. 4)
The outer ring must be press-fitted so its
grease feed hole locates at load non-acting side.  
Where moment load acts on a bearing due to
use of a vertical shaft, the load could act on the
grease feed hole. Caution it.

Linear flat rollers
NTN
Linear Flat Rollers  
This bearing type composed of a needle roller and flat
cage assembly (needle rollers are configured in the flat
cage) ensures smooth reciprocating motion with less
friction coefficient. 
Types  
For Type FF, the polyamide resin cage has a dovetail
joint groove on its both ends so that several cages can be
jointed together into one unit. 
For Type FF‥ZW, two rows of needle rollers are
configured in the cage and the cage has an elastic joint
on its center so as to enable to bend two rows of flat
rollers to any optional angle at the elastic joint by heating
them in oil of 70 to 90˚C. The two roller rows bent to any
optional angle can hold the bent shape unchanged, even
under normal operating temperature, by being cooled
down for several seconds, with the bending angle held
unchanged. 
For Type BF, the cage is press-formed from steel plate
and the standard length of the bearing unit is 1000 mm.
For Type RF, the cage is of polyamide resin and the
standard length of the bearing unit is 705 mm. The both
are unavailable for cage to cage inter-jointing, but a
bearing unit of any desired length is offerable upon
request. Feel free to contact NTN for the detailed
information.  
Needle roller tolerance 
The needle rollers contained in the flat roller cage are
manufactured within the dimensional tolerance range of 0
to -2 mm against the nominal diameter (Dw). 
Raceway surface requirements

applied to the linear flat roller bearings.

How to mount  
Theoretically the linear flat roller bearing moves by 1/2
of table moving stroke in same direction as the table
moving direction. The relationship of bed length (L) -
stroke (S) - cage length (L1) can be expressed in formula
(1).  (Fig. 2)  
L＝S/2+L1 …………………………………………（1）
The linear flat roller bearing results in moving deviation
due to profile deviation of raceway surface, uneven load
or vibration. Therefore, the table or the bed must be
equipped with a stopper at its end portion to prevent over-
run of the flat roller bearing. (Fig. 5)  
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate application examples of the
linear flat roller bearing unit.

Note 1) The dimensional tolerance for needle roller diameter Dw is 0 to -2 μm.
2) The standard length L1 of the cage shall be 1000 mm for Type BF and 705 mm for Type RF. 
Where special cage length is required, the nominal bearing number is followed by the numerical length value as exemplified below. 
Ex. Where L1 = 500 mm is required for BF3020,  BF302/500
3) The listed basic load ratings are subject to use of 10 flat rollers. Calculate the basic load ratings for any optional cage length L1 by the
following formula.
C = f17/9・Cr
C0 = f1・C0r
Herein, f1=0.1 (L1＋l－2a) / l
4) The listed weights are subject to L1 = 100 mm. 
Remarks: For Type BF
1. On occasion, the length of an ordered unit could be shorter by l dimension shown in each Dimensions Table because the roller and
cage assy is cut at the minimum unit of each pocket so as to match the required length.
2. Where this bearing unit is used frequently at various lengths, it is more economical to cut the standard bearing of 1000 mm length to
each desired length at your side.

Linear roller bearings
NTN
This roller bearing with cylindrical rollers having the
function capable of circulating within the raceway block
ensures smooth infinite linear motion on a flat surface.
The cylindrical rollers are retained and guided by the
cage and the ribs of the raceway block. 
The cage is of such a construction as not allow
adjacent rollers to contact with one another. Hence, the
friction coefficient is low.

Bearing accuracy   
All the linear roller bearings are manufactured within
the dimensional tolerance range of 0 to -2.5μm for
bearing height (H). And these bearings are delivered
classified into 5-stepped tolerance classes. (See Table 1)
Requirements and tolerances for raceway
surface and mounting surface  
Table 2 shows the requirements and tolerances for the
raceway surface, on which linear roller bearing rolls, and
the bearing mounting surface.  Where adhesion of a hard
foreign matter to the raceway surface is forecast, the
raceway surface must be protected with a proper
protective cover. 
The reference surface for mounting is the back face
and opposite face to NTN mark.
How to mount   
Fix linear roller bearing using the tapped holes which
are provided on the mounting reference surface. (See
Fig. 4)

One-way clutches
NTN
This is a compact and roller type one-way clutch which
formed a cam face on its outer ring. (Available shaft
diameter range: 6 to 35 mm)  When the outer ring is
going to rotate counterclockwise against shaft rotation
(arrow →direction on outer ring widthay surface), the
rollers advance to the position of engagement with the
outer ring cam face by spring action and drive the shaft
by acting as a wedge between the outer ring cam face
and the shaft.  (See Fig. 1) When the outer ring rotates
clockwise against the shaft, the shaft rotates
counterclockwise relatively to the outer ring and, as the
result, the rollers get away from the outer ring cam face
and simultaneously the outer ring idles against the shaft.
(See Fig. 2)

One-way clutch HF composed of an outer ring drawn from
a thin steel plate by precision drawing has the clutching
function only.  
This one-way clutch must be provided with a bearing
at its both sides to support radial load acting thereon
and to ensure smooth rotating motion. 
One-way clutch HFL has an outer ring drawn from thin
steel plate by precision drawing, a clutching function, and
an integral needle roller and cage assembly capable of
supporting radial load at its both ends respectively.
Thus, this HFL can function as clutch and, in addition,
support radial load.

Both of Type HF and HFL use a polyamide resin cage
and press the needle rollers to a wedge, which is formed
between the outer ring cam face and the shaft, by action
of a plate spring supported with the cage. 
Clutch fit 
Table 1 shows the one-way clutch fits on shaft and in
housing. Both of Type HF and HFL are only press-fitted in
a housing, needing no axial fixing by use of a snap ring,
etc. 
However, due to the outer ring drawn from thin steel by
precision drawing, the performance of the both is directly
affected by the dimensional and profile deviations of the
shaft/housing.  To avoid such an inverse affect, shaft and
housing accuracy must be controlled with good care. Any
housing is required to have the wall thickness of a
specified value or more. Table 2 shows the
recommended value.

Table 3 shows the shaft and housing requirements.
Lubrication  
Oil lubrication is optimum for these one-way clutches,
but generally grease lubrication is mostly applied to this
type of one-way clutch. NTN one-way clutches are filled
up with a suitable grease. These clutches need no further
grease replenishment, but subject to general applications. 
In replenishing, good care must be exercised of too
much grease filling. Too much filling could cause
interference with smooth clutching. 
Allowable operating temperature   
For Type HF and HFL…Oil lubrication : -10 to 120˚C 
Grease lubrication : -10 to   70˚C 
However, consult with NTN for application under
temperature exceeding the said temperature range. 
How to mount 
It is convenient to use a press-fitting mandrel as
illustrated in Fig. 3 for assembling and mounting these
one-way clutches. In that case, press-fit the outer ring,
with its stamped mark side kept in contact with the
mandrel shoulder. 
In assembling, be careful to prevent the outer ring
from twisting. Avoid to hammer directly the outer ring
and, in press-fitting, bring a proper jig in contact with
the outer ring side face without fail. Furthermore,
when press-fitting in an housing with shoulder, good
care must be exercised to prevent the bearing side
face from coming into contact with the housing
shoulder and to thereby avoid deformation of the
bearing.
Also, shaft can be easily assembled by turning it in
clutch idling direction. Where impossible to do so, provide
the shaft end with a tapered (chamfered) guide to
facilitate assembling-in.
Precautions in selecting 
NTN makes it a rule to conduct functional verification
tests on its manufactured one-way clutches under various
test conditions. However, be noted that the clutch lifetime
could reduce  depending on the following factors;
application to high load torque, high oscillation cycle and
fine oscillation, etc., large radial load acting on one-way
clutch unit, and use of a shaft with lower hardness. 
Furthermore, lock failure could occur in the cases of
fast idling speed, frequent use in idling, and application
incurring vibration.  
When using these one-way clutches under the special
conditions stated above, feel free to contact NTN for
further instructions.
When it is forecast that clutching function
failure of one-way clutch(ex. clutch slip in
engaging) could result in serious damage to
person or equipment, appropriate safety devices
must be provided separately.

Bottom roller bearings for textile machinery
NTN
These bottom roller bearings for textile machinery are
grease-prefilled needle roller bearings intended to support
the bottom rollers (fluted rollers) of a fine spinning
machine, a roving frame or a drawing frame. Type FRIS
is applied to a fine spinning machine and a roving frame,
and Type FR applied to a drawing frame. 
Types and construction  
Bottom roller bearing FRIS is used to support the
bottom rollers of a fine spinning machine and a roving
frame. The outer ring outer profile of this bearing type is
spherical, which can allow, to some extent, mounting
error in the bottom rollers. On the other hand, the inner
ring is provided with a rib at its both ends and a clearance
between the outer ring and each inner ring rib is
minimized.  Furthermore, the rib outer surface is knurled
to prevent invasion of cotton pieces into the bearing. 
These bottom roller bearings are classified into
internationally interchangeable A-series bearings with
bearing fixing saddle (to fix a bearing to a support stand)
and B-series bearings adaptable to the dimensions of JIS
Fluted Rollers. 
A-series bearings are further classified into one
bearing type (bearing number + tail code SA) wherein
inner ring and outer ring are separable from one another
according to saddle type and another bearing type
(bearing number + tail code SB) wherein inner ring and
outer ring are non-separable. Of course, these bearings
can also be supplied without saddle.
On the other hand, B-series bearings are further
classified into bearing type with grease nipple (bearing
number + tail code N) , bearing type with knock pin on its
outer ring (bearing number + tail code P) and bearing
type with knock hole on its outer ring (bearing number +
W) (latter two types---classified by the fixing method
applied). 
These bearings can be supplied with saddle thereon on
request, similarly to A-series.
Type FR is used to support the rollers of a drawing
frame. This bearing type is composed of two drawn cup
type needle roller bearings which are configured in a
housing. These have no inner ring and use a shaft as the
direct raceway surface. Synthetic rubber seal is fitted in
the both ends of the housing. This bearing type is fixed to
a support stand with knock pins press-fitted in the
housing.  The knock pin is provided with an grease hole
to enable grease replenishing.

Tensioner pulleys for textile machinery
NTN
These pulleys are used to guide and tension the tapes
and belts driving the spindles of a fine spinning machine,
a roving frame, a false twister, etc.
A pulley drawn precisely from steel plate by precision
deep drawing is press-fitted in the outer ring of shaft
bearing in in place of inner ring. 
Types and construction    
Single-row or double-row ball bearing is built in this
pulley, which is internally prefilled with lithium soap base
grease. Grease is replenished through a grease hole
which is internally provided in the stud. Two different
mounting methods are available as follows for these
pulleys; one method is to bolt a pulley to the roller carrier
of machine with holder bolt using a special-purposed
holder (Type code: JF‥S) and another method is to bolt
directly a pulley to machine frame using the bolting hole
drilled in the stud and a corresponding hexagon head
bolt. A knock pin press-fitted in the stud end face is to
lock the bolt after tightened. 
When a pulley is directly bolted to machine frame,
provide the hexagon head bolt center with a grease
through-hole for grease replenishing and screw a grease
nipple in its end face. 
In mounting a double-row ball bearing type tension
pulley, insert the stud directly into machine frame and
tighten it with nut, without using the special-purposed
holder. Replenish grease using the box nut.
Tensioner Pulleys for Textile Machinery
Composition of nominal number
Nominal number comprises type code (JPU‥S) ,
dimension code (Pulley outer dia. (D) and tail code.
Tension pulley with special-purposed holder is
represented by nominal number + tail code (holder
nominal number).

(How to read this table) 
For example, for conversion from 38˚C to ˚F read 38 in 4th row box (10th line from the top) and then read the right-side ˚F box.
38˚C is equivalent to 100.4˚F upon reading.  Furthermore, for conversion from 38˚F to ˚C read the left-side ˚C box.
˚F38 is equivalent to 3.3˚C upon reading.
C＝5/9（F－32）
F＝9/5C+32

[How to read the table]
For example, for conversion from 10kgf to N read 10 on center stage of 1st row box and then read the right-side N.
10kgf is equivalent to 98.066 upon reading.  Furthermore, for conversion from 10N to kfg read the right side kgf box.
10N is equivalent to 1.0197kg upon reading.
1kgf＝9.80665N
1N＝0.101972kgf
