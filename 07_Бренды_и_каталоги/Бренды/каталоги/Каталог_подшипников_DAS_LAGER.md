Every bearing type has some different specific
features, that make it suitable for certain specific
applications. For this reason many bearing types
and models have been developed, in order to
satisfy many different necessities for rolling
bearings. As there are so many factors to be
considered when choosing the right bearing
type, it's impossible to provide a general rule.
We will now provide the most important criteria
that need to be considered in order to select the
right bearing type.
Selection of bearing type,
considering the load magnitude
and direction
Radial load
In case of light and moderate pure radial loads,
deep groove ball bearings are the most adequate
types of bearings. In case of heavy radial loads,
or where large-diameter shafts are used, double
row cylindrical bearings are the most suitable
choice. In case of limited space and heavy loads,
needle roller bearings are recommended.
Axial load
In case of pure axial loads, when loads are
acting in only one direction, the use of single
direction thrust ball bearings is reccomended.
When loads are acting in both directions, then
double directionthrust ball bearings are to be
used. The choice of angular contact thrust ball
bearings and single or double row angular
contact ball bearings is to be done in case of light
or moderate pure axial loads at moderate speeds.
Deep groove ball bearings are adequate
in case of light axial loads at high speeds. In
these bearings, under the axial load a contact
angle different from 0° is generated, making
Selection of bearing type
them operate as angular contact ball bearings.
Therefore, in order to achieve a superior capacity
of load carrying, a larger clearance (C3, C4, etc...)
should be chosen.
In case of moderate axial loads at high speeds,
the most adequate choice is to use angular
contact ball bearings in tandem arrangement,
in order to make them take over loads acting in
both directions.
Another option is to use four-point contact ball
bearings of the QJ type.
Combined load
In case of combined radial and axial loads acting
simultaneously, bearings with a contact angle
different from 0° are to be used. In such case, the
axial load carrying capacity is proportional to the
contact angle.
Also self-aligning ball bearings, spherical roller
bearings or cylindrical roller bearings of the NJ,
NUP and NJ+HJ type can be used in order to carry
combined loads of certain values. But a special
attention should be given to some limit values
of the ratio Fa/Fr, that are shown in the bearing
tables and should never be exceeded. Cylindrical
roller bearings can carry axial loads by means of
the sliding friction on ribs.
Bearings accomodating only one direction axial
loads should always be mounted in pairs, in order
to carry axial loads in both directions.
Selection of bearing type
considering the alignment
between shaft and housing
When the operating load makes the shaft bend,
or the bearings' adjoint parts have shape or
position deviations, angular misalignments can
occur.
In similar cases, the use of self-aligning ball
bearings, cylindrical roller bearings or spherical

-- 10 of 792 --

11
roller thrust bearings is reccomended.
Errors of alignment can be compensated by
certain bearing bent angles; maximum angles for
each tipe are indicated in the introductory texts
of the table sections.
When the aim is to compensate misalignments,
then great importance must be given to radial
and axial clearance, because the possibility of self-
aligning is directly proprtional to the clearance.
If the misalignment exceeds the maximum
values indicated in the introductory texts of the
bearing tables, the result is a decrease in the
bearing rating life.
The greater the ratio Fr/C0r, the shorter the rating
life. If 0,1 < F 0r/C0r < 3, the rating life decreases
with about 25%.
Selection of bearing type
considering the operating
temperature
The use of normal bearings is reccomended
only up to a tempeature of maximum 120°C. In
case of higher tempeatures, the use of bearings
with special heat treatments is reccomended,
in accordance with the specifications indicated
on page 23.
The use of sealed bearings, 2RS type, is
reccomended only up to temperatures of
80°C, because when this temperature is
exceeded there is a considerable reduction in
the efficacy of lubricants.
Selection of bearing internal
clearance
When operating, bearings should almost
always be provided with a small radial
clearance, definable as "the possible value
of displacement in radial direction of one
bearing ring in relation to the other without
deformation of the parts".
While in use, the internal clearance of
bearings is different from the one at delivery,
becuase the latter is reduced when bearings
are mounted with a certain tight fit.
While operating, a change in the internal
clearance of bearings occurs also because
of the different temperatures between the
outer and inner ring. Bearings are generally
delivered with a normal radial or axial
clearance according to the values indicated for
each roller bearing group.
The decrease in radial clearance caused by
operating temperature and tight fit is generally
estimated to be 60-80% of the tightening
value, according to the bearing series and size.
After a decrease in the clearance in bearings,
the maintenance of a large enough operational
clearance is recommended, in order to avoid
the destruction of the lubricant film.
The operational clearance of deep groove
ball bearings should be close to zero. Often
there may be a light preload, because of the
point-contact between the rolling elements
and raceways.
The operational clearance of small-sized
cylindrical roller bearings should be between
5-10 μm, while the operational clearance of
larger-sized bearings should be around 10-30
μm.
On 	request, 	bearings 	can 	also 	be
manufactured with radial and axial clearance
smaller (C1 and C2) or larger (C3, C4, C5) than
normal, in order to assure the most favoruable
operating conditions.
It's 	also 	possible 	to 	manufacture
cylindrical and needle roller bearings with
interchangeable rings (suffix NA).
In case of bearings with non interchangeable
parts, it is not allowed to change rings from one
bearing to the other, and the radial clearance
is smaller than bearings with interchangeable
parts.
In bearings with interchangeable parts, rings
may be changed without altering the values of
radial clearance.
Bearing types and technical
characteristics
DAS LAGER can manufacture different types and
sizes of bearings, in order to meet the customers'
needs and assure an adequate reliability in
different cases of application.
Table 1.1 shows quantitative results of each
group of bearings, exposing their main technical
characteristics.
Each bearing should be selected according
to the technical characteristics required by the
specific application.
A range of graphic symbols has been developed
in order to represent the main technical
characteristics of bearings, thus making simpler
the selection of an adequate bearing for each
different purpose. Using this catalogue as
a reference, the adequate type and size of
bearing can be selected according to its specific
manufacturing and technical characteristics.

When selecting the size of a bearing, what must
be considered is the load to be endured, as well
as the operational rating life and the prescribed
operating safety.
Basic load ratings
In order to calculate bearing dimensions when
rotating under load, what is used is the basic
dynamic load rating Cr, which expresses the
bearing admissible load assuring a basic rating
life up to 1000 000 revolutions.
The basic dynamic load ratings of DAS LAGER
bearings have been calculated according to
international standard ISO 281. The values are
given in bearing tables.
The rating life is determined by considering
the basic dynamic load rating and calculating
the service time until the fatigue of the material
appears.
In case of low speeds, low oscillating movements
os stationary conditions, the basic static load
rating Cor is considered.
The basic static load rating is defined according
to international standard ISO 76, as the load acting
upon the stationary bearing. It corresponds to
a calculated contact in the center of the contact
area between the most heavily loaded rolling
element and the raceway, of:
- 4600 MPa for self-aligning ball bearings,
- 4200 MPa for all other ball bearings,
- 4000 Mpa for all roller bearings.
This amount of stress determines a permanent
deformation of the rolling element and raceway
which is about 0,0001 of the rolling element
diameter. The loads are purely radial for axial
bearings and purely axial for thrust bearings.
Selection of bearing size
Bearing life
The life of a rolling bearing is defined as the
number of revolutions or the number of operating
hours, that the bearing is capable to endure,
before the first sign of fatigue occurs on one of
its rings, on the raceway or the rolling elements.
When considering only the fatigue on the
bearing 	operating 	surfaces, 	the 	following
conditions have to be observed:
1. The forces and speeds considered in the
calculation of the bearing should correspond to
the real operating conditions.
2. During the entire operating period, adequate
lubrication should be assured.
3. If the bearing carries a light load, its failure is
due to the wear.
4. Often the failture of bearings happens to be
caused by reasons different than fatigue, such
as: selection of an improper bearing type in a
bearing joint, improper operation or lubrication,
presence of outer particles in bearing etc...
Basic rating life
The basic rating life of a single bearing or a
group of apparently identical bearings operating
under the same conditions, is the life associated
to a reliability of 90%.
The average life of a group of bearings is
approximately five times longer than the basic
rating life.
Basic rating life is marked with L 10 (millions of
revolutions) or L 10h (operating hours).
L 10 can be calculated using the equation:
L P
C

p
= ` j , where:
L10 	- basic rating life, milions of revolutions,

-- 12 of 792 --

13
C 	- basic bearing load, kN,
P 	- equivalent dynamic bearing load, kN,
p 	- exponent of the life equation with
the following values:
p=3 	- for ball bearings
p = 10/3 	- for roller bearings
The 	equivalent 	dynamic 	bearing 	load,
respectively the radial and axial load, acting
simultaneously can be calculated using the
following equations (applicable to ball and roller
radial bearings):
Pr = Fr , kN, 	- for pure radial load
Pr = XFr + YFa, kN, 	- for combined load
In case of thrust ball bearings, the following
equations can be used:
Pa = Fa, kN, 	- for pure axial load
Pa = XFr + YFa, kN, 	- for combined load
where:
Fr = the radial component of the load, kN
Fa = the axial component of the load, kN
For some groups of bearing, the details
necessary to determine the equivalent load have
been provided In the texts preceding the bearing
tables. Values for the coefficients X and Y can be
found in tables.
In the case of bearings operating at constant
speed, the basic rating life expressed in operating
hours can be calculated using the equation:
L 60 n
1000000 C/P	10h 	p
	= 	^ 	h or L n
1 	C/P	6666
10h 	p
	= 	^ 	h
where:
n = rotational speed, r/min
Values of the basic rating life L10 (milions of
revolutions) as a function of the ratio C/P can be
found in the table 2.1.
Values of the basic rating life L10h (operating
hours) as a function of the ratio C/P and speed
n can be found in table 2.2 for ball bearings and
table 2.3 for roller bearings.
When determining the bearing size, the
calculations should be based in accordance with
the rating life corresponding to the purpose of
operation.
Important factors to be considered are the
machine type, service life and the requirements
concerning operational safety.
Approximate values of the service life for
different classes of machines and equipments for
general purposes are provided in table 2.4.
The basic rating life L10h of the bearings can be
determined as a function of service life, using the
life calculation chart on page17.
The basic rating life for road and rail vehicle
bearings, for wheel-axle bearing, is expressed as
a function of the wheel diameter and covered
distance (km), using the equation:
, respectively:
where:
L10 	- 	basic 	rating 	life, 	millions 	of
revolutions
L10s 	- service life distance, millions of
kilometers
D 	- wheel diameter, m
For light loaded cars and rail vehicles,
approximate values for the service life distance
(kilometers covered) are provided in table 2.5.

Example:
1. It is required to determine the size of a deep groove ball bearing single row, considering the following conditions:
- Basic rating life L10h = 25000 operating hours
- Rotational speed n = 1000 r/min
- Load in bearing Fr = 5 kN
The chart shows that C/P = 11,6; C = 11,6, P = 11,6 x 5 = 58 kN. In the catalogue on page 100, you can select the bearing 6310
type with the following characteristics: Cr = 61,8kN; n = 7000 r/min.
2. What is the basic rating life o the bearing NU 210E which is operating under a radial load of 7,7 kN at rotational speed
n = 750 r/min?
See page 219 in the catalogue and you will find for the bearing, NU 210E type, the following values: C r = 63,7 kN,
n = 8000 r/min. From the chart, for a bearing operated at a rotational speed of 750 r/min and Cr/Pr = 63,7/7,7 = 8,3, a basic
rating life L10h = 25000.

In 	case 	of 	bearings 	which 	do 	not
rotate 	but 	oscillate 	from 	a 	central
position through an angle, as shown in
fig. 1, basic rating life can be determined as
follows:
, where:
L10sc 	- bearing rating life, millions of cycles
δ 	- oscillation 	amplitude 	(angle 	of
maximum deviation from center
position), degrees.
If the amplitude of oscillation is very small, it can
be ignored for basic rating life determination.
Fluctuating dynamic load and
speeds
Often, during operation, there can be a
fluctuation in operation speed and/or magnitude
of load. In such cases, it's necessary to calculate a
mean dynamic load.

The load acting on the bearing can vary as
shown in fig. 2-a and 2-b.
Fig. 2
In this case, the mean load can be determined
using the equation:

where:

F 1, F2, ... Fn 	- constant load during n1,
n2, ... nn revolutions, kN
n 	- total 	number 	of 	revolutions
(n=n1+n2+...) during which loads
F1, F2, ... act
p 	- exponent - 3 	- for ball bearings,
-10/3 - for roller bearings.
If the bearing speed is constant and the
magnitude of the load is between the minimum
value Fmin and a maximum value Fmax as shown
in fig. 3a and b, the mean load can be obtained
from:
F 3
F 	2F , kN	m 	min 	max

Fig. 3
If the external radial load consists of a load F1
which is constant in magnitude and direction
and a load F2 which is variable in direction and
constant in magnitude (F1 and F2 acting in the
same plane) as shown in fig. 4, the mean load can
be determined using the equation:
Fm = fm (F1+F2), kN
Fig. 4
Values for the factor f m can be obtained from
fig.5.
In case of sinusoidal movement as it is shown in
fig 6, the mean load can be obtained from:
F 3

Fm ≈ 0,75 Fmax, kN, for ball bearings

In case of oscilating movements with oscillating
angle γ , as shown in fig. 7, equivalent mean load
can be calculated with the equation:
If the fluctuating load acts in a pure radial
direction for radial bearings and in a pure axial
direction for thrust bearings, the equivalent
dynamic bearing load will be: Pr = Fm .
For combined loads, with radial load Fr and axial
load Fa constant in direction and magnitude, the
equivalent dynamic load can be calculated using
the equation
Pr = XFr + YFa, kN
Fig. 5
Fig. 6
Fig. 7
In case of combined loads, with radial and axial
loads changing in time, ratio Fr/Fa being constant,
the equivalent dynamic load can be calculated
by:
Pm = XFrm +YFam ,
where:
Pm 	- equivalent mean dynamic load, kN
Frm 	- radial mean load, kN
Fam 	- axial mean load, kN
X,Y 	- factors of radial and axial load.
In case the direction and magnitude of the load
change in time and speeds fluctuate in time, the
equivalent mean dynamic load will be calculated
using the equation:

Basic dynamic load of a bearing
group
In case of ball and roller bearings especially, a
bearing group of the same type mounted close
together is required, so that heavy radial loads
can be carried.
In order to take over the load uniformly these
bearings should be mounted in order to equal the
diameter deviations to the radial clearances.
These deviations must be kept below 1/2 of the
admitted tolerance class.
Basic dynamic load for a bearing group, as a
function of the basic load of the single bearing,
can be calculated using the equation:
Cri = Cr in ,
where:
Cri 	- basic dynamic load of the bearing
group, kN
Cr 	- basic dynamic load of the single
bearing, selected from the tables,
i 	- number of bearings of the same
type, mounted close together,
n 	- exponent depending on the bearing
type:
0,7 - for ball bearings
7/9 - for roller bearings
Values of i n are given in table 2.6.

Adjusted rating life
Basic rating life L10 h is often satisfactory
for bearing performances. This life means a
reliability of 90% for material and a modern and
usual manufacturing technology, as well as for
conventional operating conditions.
For a reliability over 90% (100-n)%, ISO
recommends 	steels 	elaborated 	in 	better
conditions, 	high 	level 	manufacturing
technologies and specific operating conditions.
In this case, adjusted rating life can be calculated
as follows:

where:

revolutions
a 1 	- life adjustement factor considering
reliability
a 2 	- life adjustement factor considering
the material and manufacturing
conditions
a 3 	- life adjustement factor considering
the operating conditions.
In case of life adjustment factors a1, a2, a3
greater than 1, when calculating adjusted rating
life, prudence and familiarity with bearing
manufacturing 	and 	operating 	conditions,
including shaft bending and housing stiffness are
recommended.
Life adjustement factor a1 for reliability
The bearing failure, caused by fatigue, is
subjected to certain statistic laws. Therefore, this
fact is recommended to be considered when
calculating the bearing life.
Values of the life adjustment factor a 1 for
eliabilities over than 90% are given in table 2.7.

Life adjustment factor a2 for material
Life adjustment factor a2 takes into account the
properties of the material, heat treatment of the
steel and maufacturing technologies. For DAS
LAGER bearings, a 2=1 is recommended.
Life adjustment factor a23 for operating
conditions
In order to achieve the longest life of a bearing,
the best possible condition is hydrodynamic
lubrication, that is when there is no direct
contact between rolling elements and raceway
due to the lubricant film. World leading bearing
manufacturing companies have accomplished
many researches in this field, showing that there
is a relationship between life adjustment factor
a2 for material and life adjustment factor a3 for
operating conditions. These factors can thus be
preferably unified, obtaining factor a23. In such
case, the adjusted rating life would be:
L na = a1 a23 L10 or Lna = a1 a23 L10h
These values of a23 coefficient depend on the
lubricant used for bearing lubrication, namely
on the ratio of the oil viscosity at +40°C, ν (initial
value) to the viscosity required for adequate
lubrication at the operating temperature ν 1. The
values are given in table 2.8.
Values for factor a23

The values of viscosity ν 1, as a function of the
mean bearing diameter and operating speed, are
given in the diagram fig. 8.
Kinematic viscosity ν at the temperature of
+40°C can be determined from the diagram fig.
9 in accordance with ISO, if the bearing operating
temperature is known.

In case of grease lubrication, calculation should
be done considering the basic oil viscosity and
the value of the life adjustment factor a 23 will be
smaller than 1.
Example of oil kinematic viscosity calculation for bearing
lubrication:
The bearing 6212 operates at a speed of 3500 r/min and a
temperature of +70°C.
Mean diameter will be:
0,5 (d+D) = 0,5 (60+110) = 85 mm
From the diagram fig. 9, at a temperature of +70°C, for a
viscosity ν 1 = 8 mm 2/s, the viscosity at +40°C is 20 mm 2/s
(cSt).
In this case should be selected an oil in accordance with
ISO VG22 with kinematic viscosity limits: ν min = 19,8 mm 2/s
(cSt) and νmax = 24,2 mm2/s (Cst)
In case of bearing operating at temperatures
higher than +150°C, an adjustment factor f t
for temperature should be added to the life
adjustment factor a23. Adjusted rating life will be:
Lna = a1 a23 f t L10 or Lna = a1 a23 f t L10h
Values for the life adjustment factor ft for
temperature are given in table 2.9.
material fatigue but by permanent deformation
caused at the rolling element/raceway contact.
It is also the case of rotating bearings, when
they have to sustain heavy shock loads which act
during a fraction of their revolution.
Generally, the value of the load may increase up
to the value of the basic static load C0, without
altering the bearing operating properties.
Equivalent static load
Combined static load (radial and axial load
acting simultaneosly on bearing) must be
converted into an equivalent static bearing
load. This is defined as the load (radial for radial
bearings and axial for thrust bearings) which
is applied, would cause the same permanent
deformation in the bearing as the real load
operating upon it.
Equivalent static load is obtained from the
general equation:
P 0 = X0 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN,
where:
P0 	- equivalent static bearing load, kN,
Fr 	- radial component of the heaviest
static load, kN,
Fa 	- axial component of the heaviest
static load, kN,
X 0 	- radial load factor of the bearing,
Y0 	- axial load factor of the bearing.
Data needed to calculate equivalent static load
can be found in text and in bearing tables.
Requisite basic static load rating
When determining bearing size on the basis of
the static load, a static safety factor s0 is used.

f t 	1 	0,73 0,42 0,22
Static load
When the bearing is stationary or rotates at slow
movements or very low speeds (lower than 10 r/
min), basic static load is not determined by the 	Fig. 9

-- 22 of 792 --

23
The requisite basic static load is calculated using
the equation:
Cr0 = s0 Pr0, kN,
where:
Cr0 	- basic static load rating, kN,
s 0 	- static safety factor, table 2.11,
Pr0 	- equivalent static load, kN.
At high temperatures, life of the material
decreases and the static load carrying capacity of
bearings is reduced.
For high temperatures, basic static load is
calculated using the equation:
Cr0 = f0t s0 Pr0, kN,
The 	values 	of 	factor 	f 0t 	depending
on 	temperature 	is 	given 	in 	table 	2.10.

Non-rotating bearings
In case of non-rotating bearings, the values of
static safety factor s0, for certain applications are
given in table 2.11. These values are also valid for
bearings with oscillating movements.

Rotating bearings
In case of fluctuating or oscillating loads and
especially when heavy shock loads are acting
during a fraction of revolution, it is necessary to
check if the bearing has the proper static load
carrying capacity.
Heavy shock loads, higher than the basic static
bearing load, produce permanent deformations
not uniformly distributed on raceway, which
influence negatively upon bearing running.
Generally, heavy shock loads cannot be
exactly calculated and in certain cases they
produce deformations of bearing housing and
consequently an unfavorable load distribution in
bearing.
When a bearing rotates under maximum load,
raceway becomes uniformly deformed on all its
outer surface without any imprint.
For various operating conditions, maximum
load acting upon the bearing is calculated with
static safety factor s 0, depending on the vibrations
and shock loads.
The values of static safety factor are given in
table 2.12.

If the value of s 0 is less than recommended in
table 2.12, then a bearing with a higher basic

Basic static load for a group of
bearings
Where more bearings of the same type are
mounted close together to take over a static load,
the load magnitude supported by these bearings
will be calculated from:
C0ri = C0r i,
where:
C 0ri 	- basic static load of the bearing
group,
C 0r 	- basic static load of the single bearing
(from tables),
i 	- number of bearings.

ISO 492, ISO 199, ISO 582 and ISO 1132 are
the international standards defining bearing
tolerances.
In 	general 	conditions, 	bearings 	are

but upon request, in case of special applications
such as very accurate shaft guidance or very
high speeds, they can be manufactured to the
tolerance classes P6, P6X, P5, P4 e P2.

Locating bearings and non-locating
bearings
Radial and axial loads in bearing units can
be transmitted by locating and non-locating
bearings.
A locating bearing is generally used for
medium and large-sized shafts that can reach
high temperatures during operation. It needs to
support radially the shaft assembly and to locate
it axially in both directions.
A non-locating bearing supports the shaft
assembly only radially, while allowing axial
displacement in relation to the housing, in order
to avoid additional axial loading.
Axial displacement can take place either in the
housing bore seating or in the bearing itself.
If the shaft is supported by more than two
bearings, only one of them will be a locating
bearing and it will be the one with the lightest
radial load.
In case of small-sized shaft, it's possible to
use two non-locating bearings with limited
displacement. Each of them can accommodate
axial loads in a single direction, having this
mutual location.
Fig. 4.1 shows a few of the most representative
applications 	of 	locating 	and 	non-locating
bearings, as follows:
a) The locating bearing is a single row deep
groove ball bearing and the non-locating one
is a cylindrical roller bearing with both rings
tightly fitted on the shaft and into the housing,
respectively.
b) Both bearings are supported by spherical
roller berings. The locating bearing is tightly fitted
both on the shaft and into the housing. The non-
locating bearing has the outer ring mounted with
clearance into the housing and thus allows axial
displacement in both directions.
The locating bearing consist of a cylindrical
roller bearing, NUP type and the non-locating
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU

type.
d) The locating bearing consist of a cylindrical
roller bearing, NUP type. The non-locating
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU
type.
e) The locating bearings consists of a cylindrical
roller bearing, NU type which takes over radial
loads and of a four-point contact ball bearing
(unloaded on the outside). The non-locating
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU
type.
f ) The locating bearing consists of a needle roller
bearing, NA type which takes over radial loads
and of a single row deep groove ball bearing
(unloaded on the outside) which takes over axial
loads in both directions. The non-locating bearing
consists of a needle roller bearing, NA type.
g) The shafts bearings can also be X-type
arrangement of two tapererd roller bearings
which can be considered mutual located bearing.
Recommendation for bearing fit
selection
When selecting the bearing fit, three main
criteria should be considered:
1. Firm loaction and uniform support of rings
2. Location and dismounting
3. Axial displacement of non-locating bearing
The most common location is assured by a tight
fit.
A high tightening is recommended for roller
bearings and large- sized bearings in comparasion
to ball bearings of the same size.
In case of a tight fit, the inner ring is supported
by the entire shaft contact surface, ensuring that
the bearing is used at full load carrying capacity.
The tolerance classes given in table 4.1 and 4.3
are available for bearing fits which do not exceed
+120°C during operation.
As a general rule, the selection of the tolerance
class "H" is recommended for bearings of
separable design and tolerance class "J" for
bearings of non-separable design.
When selecting a fit, the load of rotating ring
has to consider, namely:
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is
stationary, the outer ring should be mounted
with clearance fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is
stationary, the outer ring should be mounted
with tight fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the direction of
load is not determined, both rings should be
mounted with tight fit.
In table 4.1 one can find recommendations to
select the tolerance class for shaft as a function of:
bearing type, loading and shaft diameter. In table
4.3 there are given reccomendations to select the
tolerance class for housing.
Figure 4.2 shows schematically the tolerance
classes for shaft and housing and their influence
over fit type i.e. clearance, transition or tight fit
for housing and transition fit or tight fit for shaft,
respectively.
In tables 4.2 and 4.4, the deviations of the shaft
diameter (4.2) and of the housing diameter (4.4)
are given, considering the following:
- upper and lower limits
- theoretical minimum and maximum values of
tightening (+) or clearance (-) in the fit
- the minimum and maximum values of the
probable tightening or clearance in the fit (99%
of fits are between these limits).
The tolerances of bore diameter dmp and
outside diameter Dmp are valid for all metric
sized bearings, except tapered roller bearings
with d<30 mm and D<150 mm and thrust ball
bearings with D≤150 mm, (see table 3.15 and 3.16

Bearing axial location
Axial location of bearings is necessary in order
to assure a proper guiding of assembly in an
assembly under operation.
A tight fit is inadequate for the axial location of
bearings. Axial location for both rings is generally
needed when locating bearings. In Fig.4.4 it's
possible to see some relevant solutions of bearing
axial location, on shaft or into the housing.
In case of bearings with light axial loads,
bearings can be located using a lock nut and a
lock washer (a), an end plate fastened by a screw
at the shaft end (b) and, for bearings carring light
axial loads, by lock rings mounted in shaft and
housing grooves (c).
In case of bearings with NR design, with groove
and snap ring on the outer ring, can be easily
located by supporting the inner ring on the shaft
shoulder and the outer ring with a threaded ring
and a safety plate fastened by a screw (e).
Tapered bore bearings can be mounted and
axially located by adapter or withdrawal sleeves
(f,g).
The axial load carrying capacity of the bearings
mounted with adapter or withdrawal sleeves is
determined by the friction between shaft and
sleeve (g).
In order to locate radial bearings, where axial
adjustment of the shaft is required, setting
washers (i) or spacer rings (i) are used between
the outer rings, determining experimentally,
during the mounting operation, the width of the
spacer ring.
Bearing sealing
Seals are used in most of bearing arrangements,
in order to ensure the best conditions for proper
operation, that is: retaining the lubricant in the
bearing and preventing solid contaminants (like
water, dust, hard particles, aggressive substances,
etc...) from penetrating into the bearing.
The classification of seals for rolling bearings is
done considering some important criteria like:
design, operation, type of lubricant, etc...
Concerning issues of design and operation,
seals can be defined as: stationary seals between
the stationary bearing elements (housing and
cover), rotary seals between the rotating bearing
elements, or they can also be rubbing or non-
rubbing seals, used in special applications
(surrounding conditions and loading stress).
Rotary non-rubbing seals are often used
because of their simple design. They are specially
used at high speed or temperatures, both for
grease and oil, as they have practically no friction
and they do not wear.
When using grease lubrication, the bearing
operating temperature must be 20°C lower than
the melting temperature of the grease (dropping
point).
The main constructive types of rotary non-
rubbing seals have narrow gaps and labyrinths;
their combinations are shown in fig.4.5 a-c.
Gap seals constitute the simplest constructive
solution for a rotary non-rubbing seal that
must retain grease in the bearing housing. The
efficacy of sealing is linked to the gap length (L)
and the clearance between shaft and housing.
It's possible to improve it providing one or more

-- 61 of 792 --

62
In case of rotary rubbing seals, there is direct
contact between a seal elastic element and the
rotating element, as shown in fig.4.8.
When selecting the proper rotary rubbing,
one should consider the following factors: the
material and its elasticity (felt, rubber, plastic,
leather, graphite, etc...), the resistance at various
temperatures, the maximum peripherical speed
on sealing surface, the sealing direction, etc...
The sealing properties of these systems are
higher than those corresponding to non-
rubbing seals. Because of their simple design and
cheapness, felt ring seals (a) are often used in case
of grease lubrication at peripheral speeds higher
than 4 m/s and temperatures over +100°C.
In order to improve their sealing properties and
reduce the friction, before mounting, felt rings are
impregnated with a mixture of mineral oil (66%)
and paraffin (34%) at a temperature of +70-80°C.
In case of higher temperatures and peripheral
speeds over 12 m/s, surface roughness is Ra = 1,6
μm, therefore the space between the ends of the
seal should be filled with grease. Two felt rings
can be used for sealing.
In case of oil lubricated bearings which ae
operated under peripherical speeds of 5-10 m/s
and temperature between -40°C and +20°C,
it is preferable to use rubbing seals with an
incorporated spring, which in most cases are
made of synthetic rubber and have a metallic
hardering fixture.
When operating at peripheral speeds over 8
m/s, inclined sealing surfaces are reccomended to
be ground Ra = 0,8 μm and hardened at 45 HRC.
The rubbing seal with incorporated spring can
be mounted with the edge inwards (c) in order
to prevent the lubricant outflow, or outwards (d)
if sealing has to prevent dust or other impurities
form penetrating into the bearing.
circular grooves on the shaft or in the housing,
which are to be filled with grease (b). If oil is used
for lubrication, then the grooves on the shaft
must be helical (c) and their direction and the
direction of the shaft rotary movement must be
the same.
It has been experimentally proved that in order
to achieve the most favorable clearance the limits
of the fit should be A11/h10, the geometrical
deviations should be IT6, and the gap surface
roughness Ra = 12,6 μm.
Labyrinth seals are generally used at high
peripheral speeds, within impure surroundings.

-- 62 of 792 --

63
It's also possible to use a double sealing with
these rubbing seals.
V-ring seals are used to prevent the penetration
of dus or other contaminants into the bearing,
providing best results in case of oil or grease
lubrication. The elastic rubber lip of the V-ring
seal is notched on the plane sealing surface,
drawing the fluids in centrifugal motion. V-ring
seals can be used at temperatures between -40°C
and +100°C, with a sealing surface roughness Ra
= 1,5-3 μm. At peripheral speeds up to 15 m/s, the
V-ring seal operates as a rubbing seal (as the seal
lip reaches the sealing surface), while in case o
fperipheral speeds over 15 m/s the seal lip ends
up lifting from the sealing surface, operating as a
centrifugal sealing.
The use of V-ring seals is also suggested in case
of angular misalignments (2-3°), as they are made
of high quality, elastic rubber, and they are easy
to be mounted.
The efficacy of sealing depends on the fact that
the ring body acts as a flinger for dirt and fluids.
For this reason, in case of oil lubrication the seal
is generally placed inside the housing, while in
case of grease lubrication it is arrenged outside
the housing.
Pressed sheet washers provide a simle, space-
saving and inexpensive sealing, specially for
grease lubricated deep groove ball bearings. The
washers are clamped against either the outer of
the inner ring, exerting a resilient pressure axially
against the rubbing ring. In usual applications,
the types of seals mentioned above, or their
combinations shown in fig 4.9, are used, some
of them becoming standard seals for rolling
bearings (e.g. Labyrinths, felt rings, V-rings, etc...).
Better sealing can thus be obrained if felt ring
(a) or V-ring (b) are combined with radial or axial
labyrinth non-rubbing seals.
In case of unusual surroundings and loading
conditions (e.g. helm of ocean-vessels, rolling
mills, main shaft of grinding machines, etc...)
special seals are generally used.
Sealed bearings of the type 2RS (2RSR) (a) or
shielded bearings of the type 2Z (2ZR) (b) shown
in fig. 4.10 a-b provide simple and inexpensive
sealing, with superior operating results. These
roller bearings are delivered ready greased, and
no provision for relubrication and maintenance
is needed. They are generally used in case of
bearings with a small free space available, where
other seals cannot be used.

The safe operating and long rating life of
bearings are dependant on the type and quality
of lubricant, and on the method of lubrication.
The lubrication of bearings is necessary for
several purposes, like:
- to reduce friction between rolling elements
and raceway, rolling elements and cage, cage and
guiding ribs of rings during operation;
- to ensure the protection of bearings against
corrosion;
- to reduce within certain limits the noise
produced during bearings' operation;
- to distribute heat in an uniform way in contact
areas, and to remove it outside thanks to lubricant
circulation.
Lubricants used for the lubrication of bearings
should satisfy these conditions:
- physical and chemical stability;
- absence of foreign mechanical substances
(abrasive, metallic substances, etc...);
- minimal coefficient of friction;
- non-corrosivity;
- good lubricating capacity.
The lubricants used for bearing lubrication can
belong to two categories:
- fluid lubricants (oils);
- plastic lubricants (greases).
A comparison between fluid and plastic
lubricants can be seen in table 5.1.
Although fluid lubricants have generally better
characteristics than plastic lubricants, they cannot
be used in all case because of sealing problems.

Selection of lubricants
When selecting lubricants, a special attention
is needed, in order to consider all lubricant
properties and operating conditions. There is
no lubrication system that can be considered
universally valid.
So the most important criteria to be considered
when selecting a lubricant are the following ones:
- size of bearing
- load
- bearing operating temperature
- speed
The effects of these characteristics on the
lubricant viscosity are as follows:
- the higher the size of bearing, value of load and
temperature, the higher the viscosity
- the effect of bearing speed is determined using
the product Dmn, as shown in table 5.2.

equivalent to 500x10³, offering the following
advantages:
- it is more easily retained in the bearing;
- it assures anti-corrosive protection to the
bearing thanks to its water-resistant properties;
- it has low expenses for sealing.
One should not exceed in the supply of grease
quantity, because otherwise the effect will be a
braking in rotation, and an increase in friction and
operating temperature, without positive effects
on the bearing rating life.
The quantity of grease to be inserted in
the bearing seating should be as follows, in
accordance with the free space inside the
housing:
- 1/2... 3/4 of the free space in the housing, in
case of normal speeds;
- 1/3 of the free space in the housing, in case of
high speeds and speed limit;
- the whole housing space should be free, in
case of low speeds and product Dm n < 10x103.
The quantity of grease can be calculated as
a function of bearing bore diameter using the
equation:
G = K d2.5 , (g).
where:
K = 1/900 - for ball bearings
K = 1/350 - for roller bearings
d = bore diameter, mm
Relubrication intervals in most cases can be
experimentally determined and depend on:
- bearing type
- bearing size
- operating temperature
- grease properties

From the diagram fig. 5.1, the value of the relubrication
interval will be of 13500 operating hours.
The grease quantity to be supplied can be
determined using the equation:
G = K D B, (g),
where:
G = grease quantity, g
K = coefficient depending on the relubrication
interval, table 5.6
D = bearing outside diameter, mm
B = total bearing width for radial bearings, mm and
total bearing height for thrust bearings, mm
The chart in fig. 5.1 applies to operating
temperatures which do not exceed +70oC. For
operating temperatures over +70oC, see table 5.4.
Grease service life can be defined as the
period of time when it preserves physical and
mechanical characteristics in time and oxidizing
due to temperature and vaporization of base oil
doesn’t occur.
A more accurate calculation of grease service life,
considering grease quality and bearing operating
conditions (load, size, speed, temperature etc.)
can be done using the equation:
L = 10a-(m1 + m2 + m3)
where
L = service life, operating hours
a = exponent depending on the grease quality
(a = 5,8... 6,1)
m 1... m3 = exponents which take into account
the following factors:
m1 = 4,4 x 10-6 Dm n,

n = bearing speeds, r/min,

t = bearing operating temperature, 0C
When calculating the values of t, Dm n and P/C,
the following have to be considered:

-- 67 of 792 --

- when bearing operating temperature is lower
than +500C, then t = +500C
- when speed factor D m n < 125000, then D m n
= 125000
- when ratio P/C < 0,05, then P/C = 0,05
Grease service life, as a function of operating
temperature can be approximately determined
using the diagram fig. 5.2.
Example 1
A bearing 6210 operates under a load Pr = 5 kN,
speed n = 3000 r/min at an operating tempera-
ture t = 50 0C. What is the service life of the grease
used for bearing lubrication?
Cr = 35,2 kN, tables on page 100. bearing 6210
L = 10 a-(m1+m2+m3) = 106,1-2.273 = 6214 hours
a = 6,1, for Mobil grease,
Dm n = 65x3000 = 195x103
Pr/Cr = 5/35,2 = 0,143
m1 = 4,4 x 10-6 Dm n = 0,858
m 2 = 2,5 (Pr/Cr - 0,05) = 0,23
m 3 = (0,021 - 1,80 x 10-8 Dm n) 65 = 1,119
m 1 + m2 + m3 = 2,273
Example 2
For the same bearing and operating conditions
as in Example 1, it is required to find the service
life of the same grease at a temperature of
t = 95oC.
m3 = 1,66
m1 + m2 + m3 = 2,794
L = 106,1-2,794 = 103,306 = 1774 operating hours
From the diagram fig. 5.2, we can find
approximately the same value, respectively 6000
operating hours at + 650C and 1700 operating
hours at +950C.
Table 5.7 shows technical characteristics of usual
grease, which are recommended for lubrication
of sealed and shielded bearings, 2RS and 2Z types

Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication can be used in any operating
condition, but this kind of lubrication is
compulsory when the value of the product n
from table 5.2 is exceeded for grease, namely
D m n>500 x 10 3 and when high temperatures
occur in bearing. Then, oil has to lubricate and to
remove heat from bearing.
Oils used for bearing lubrication can be:
- mineral oils, used up to a temperature of
+1500C.
- synthetic oils, used up to a temperature of
+2200C.
For a proper lubrication of bearings, low
quantities of lubricants to reach the rolling
elements are needed.
The lubricating systems must provide the oil
quantity necessary to prevent oil draining from
bearing and heat removal in case of high speeds.
Most usual oil lubricating systems depending
on factor Dm n are given in tables 5.8.

Diagram fig. 5.7 shows kinematic viscosity
classes at 400C in accordance with ISO, its variation
depending on the operating temperature (t 0C)
in relation to speed and bearing mean diameter
(D m).
Example
A bearing 6204 is to operate under a speed n =
2 000 r/min at a temperature t = +650C. Dm = 0,5
(d+D) = 35,5 mm.
The viscosity of the oil for bearing lubrication is
required.
From the diagram, for D m = 35,5 mm, we can
find viscosity at +65 0C, ν1 = 13 cSt and viscosity
at + 400C, ν = 32cSt.

by ISO for bearing lubrication. Values of kinematic
viscosity at +400C, mm2/s are also given.

Bearing designation
A precise designation is necessary in order
to identify bearing, so that bearings with the
same designation can be interchangeable both
dimensionally and operationally, no matter if they
are produced by different companies in different
countries. The designation system of DAS LAGER
rolling bearings are in accordance with those
The 	basic 	designation 	consists 	of 	an
identification of the bearing type (letter or figure),
the series designation in accordance with ISO,
and the bore diameter identification.
The designation of the bearing type and
dimension series, for the main standardized
bearing types, are given in fig. 6.1.
Bore diameter identification consist of one, two
or more figures as follows:
- bore diameter 	- one figure, representing
from 1 to 9 mm 	the 	bore 	diameter
(e.g. 623, 608);
- bore diameter 	- two figures, as follows:
from 10 to 495 mm 	00 for 10 mm, 01 for 12
mm, 02 for 15 mm, 03 for
17 mm, 04 and up to
99 	for 	bore 	diameter
from 20 to 495 mm.
(bore diameter = bore
diameter identification x 5,
used by world-known bearing companies: SKF,
FAG, INA, KOYO etc.
The complete designation of a bearing is
composed by a basic designation, possibly
followed by one or more supplementary
designations (prefixes and suffixes), as shown in
fig 6.1.
e.g. 6230, d = 150 mm);
- bore diameter 	- 	is 	stated 	directly
of 500 mm and 	separated by a slash, the
over 500 mm 	same 	applies 	to 	the
values 	which 	are 	not
perfect multiples of 5,
or 	if 	they 	include 	a
decimal 	point 	(e.g.
610/560, 62/32, 62/1,5).
Tapered roller bearings with inch dimensions
listed in this catalogues make an exception from
this rule.
Prefixes
Prefixes are letter-based identifications, used
to indicate the material, other than steel for
bearings or component parts of bearing. The
prefix identificating the material is separated
form the rest of designation by a horizontal line.

Suffixes
Suffixes are used to identify various constructive
modifications of the bearing in comparison to
normal design. They are classified in four different
groups, as follows:
Group I 	- Modifications of internal design,
design with increased basic load
(e.g. A, C, E etc.), contact angle (e.g.
A, B, C) and others.
Group II 	- Modifications of external design,
tapered bore, groove on outer ring
etc. (e.g. 30205A, 1210K, 6210NR,
6310-2RS)
Group III 	- Modifcations 	of 	cage 	design,
material, guiding surfaces etc. (e.g.
6205TN, NU310MA)
Group IV 	- Modifcations of normal design
regarding 	tolerance 	classes,
bearing radial or axial clearance,
stability of dimensions at high
temperatures, bearing matching
etc. 	(e.g. 	6206P5, 	6310P53,
NU210SO, 7010CDB).
These suffixes for bearing designation are listed
considering the groups they belong to, at the
beginning of each bearing group.

-- 73 of 792 --

74
The good operation of rolling bearings is also
influenced by the properness of their mounting
and dismounting, considering the type and size
of bearing fit, adequate tools for these operations,
performance, etc...
As they are precision components, rolling
bearings must be handled carefully when
storing or mounting, observing the following
precautions:
- storing bearings in their original package on
special shelves, in a dry room, with temperature
of +18/+20° and maximum moisture degree of
60%;
- handling bearings carefully when storing
or mounting, in order to protect the original
package;
- unpacking bearings only when they are to be
mounted;
- as the adjoint parts of bearings are very
accurate, without burrs, chips or hits, a special
care should be taken;
- they shouldn't be washed if the original
package hasn't been destroyed.
Mounting of bearings with
cylindrical bore
Bearings with cylindrical bore which need to
have a tight fit on shaft or in housing, shall be
mounted by mechanical, thermic or hydraulic
means.
The pressing force should be transmitted only
by the ring which is pressed on the shaft or into
the housing bore, avoiding the transmission
by rolling bearings, which could be deformed
causing a premature damage.
Special sleeves with one or two ribs, fig. 7.1,
a and b are used when mounting small and
medium-sized bearings, which are to be mounted
with transition fit. In case of self-aligning ball
bearings or spherical roller thrust bearings, a
plate is mounted for a proper location of the
outer rings, as shown in fig. 7.2.
Mechanical or hydraulic presses are used as
shown in fig. 7.3, in case of serial production so
that force can be continuously and gradually
applied.
For the mounting of bearings with clearance
fit into the housing or on the shaft, the ring with
transition or tight fit should be mounted first,
after which the shaft-bearing assembly will be
mounted into the housing as shown in fig. 7.4, a
and b.
In case of dismountable bearings, rings can be
mounted separately - fig. 7.5, even if an tight fit is
required for both rings.
Mounting and dismounting

-- 74 of 792 --

75
For the bearings heating, oil bath, electric range,
heating device with thermic ring or induction
heating device etc. can be used as shown in fig.
7.6, a-d.
The device with thermic ring - fig. 7.6 c consists of
a split aluminium ring with three grips and cuts
which make it be elastic.
Thermic ring bore diameter is equal to inner
ring raceway diameter of dismountable bearings.
The ring outside diameter can be calculated
using the equation:
D 	4d 	3d , mm	ex 	1
2 	2
	= 	-
where:
D ex = outside diameter of the thermic ring,
d 1 = diameter of the inner ring raceway, mm
d = bearing bore diameter, mm
The mounting of medium (d > 50 mm) and
large-sized bearings with tight fit, requires much
greater pressing forces. That’s why in this case
heating of bearings up to +800C...+1100C should
be used instead of pressing, excepting shielded
bearings, 2Z (2ZR) type and sealed bearings, 2RS
(2RSR) type.

-- 75 of 792 --

76
The weight of the thermic ring is approximately
equal to the weight of the bearing inner ring.
In case of large-sized cylindrical roller bearings,
heating is done with induction devices. These
devices consist of a coil inductor, thermal relays
for temperature adjustment and timers. 380 V
voltage and 50 - 60 Hz frequency inductors are
used for bearings with bore diameter up to 200
mm. For larger-sized bearings, 20... 40 V voltage
and 50 - 60 Hz inductors are used.
This device is schematically shown in fig. 7.6.d.
Mounting of bearings with
tapered bore
Tapered bore bearings can be mounted directly
on the shaft, on adapter sleeve or withdrawal
sleeve. These bearings should always be mounted
only with a tight fit. The tight fit can be done by
an axial displacement of the bearing inner ring
which is mounted directly on the tapered spindle
of the shaft or by an axial disaplacement of the
adapter or withdrawal sleeve.
The values of reduction in radial clearance
are given in tables 7.1 and 7.2, as function of
axial displacement on shaft of self-aligning ball
bearings and spherical roller thrust bearings.
After mounting the initial radial clearance is to be
considered.
After mounting, radial clearance of radial and
self-aligning ball bearings are in accordance with
table 7.1.
The values of tightening are estimated by the
values of the radial clearance reduction or of axial
displacement. Axial displacement of the mounted
bearings is measured by means of a limit gauge,
as shown in fig. 7.7, a and b. The thickness of the
limit gauge can be calculated from:
m = S - a
where:
m = thickness of the limit gauge, mm
S = distance initially measured, mm
a = axial displacement, from table 7.1, mm
Example
A bearing 22252, d = 260 mm, taper: 1:12, distance s = 10
mm, distance “a“ from table 7.2 = 1,90 mm, m = 10 - 1,9 =
8,10 mm
Small-sized bearings with tapered bore which
are to be mounted directly on the shaft or with
adapter or withdrawal sleeves can be axially
displaced by means of a nut as shown in fig. 7.8,
a, or by means of a special sleeve as in fig. 7.8 b,c.
Medium-sized bearings can be axially displaced
by means of a special nut as shown in fig. 7.9 and
some screws. Then, the nut is to be dismounted
and replaced with a nut for axial fastening.
Special hydraulic presses - fig. 7.11 are used to
mount medium and large-sized bearings.
To reduce the bearing displacing force in case
of large-sized bearings, pressurized oil is to be
introduced between the tapered surfaces of the
shaft spindle, bearing and adapter or withdrawal
sleeves, as shown in fig 7,11 a and b, by means
of an oil pump - fig. 7.10 or oil injector - fig. 7.12.
One or more grooves, should be provided
as shown in fig. 7.13, a and b so that oil can be
distributed between the mounting surfaces.

Bearing dismounting
When bearings with tapered bore are to be
dismounted from the shaft or housing, the
succession of operations is inversely done than in
case of mounting.
Thus, the assembly mounted with clearance fit
or small tightening is to be dismounted first and
then the parts mounted with greater tightening,
as shown in fig. 7.14 and fig. 7.15.
To use mechanical or hydraulic instruments,
when dismounting bearings, a special design of
the shaft and housing is required, as shown in fig.
7.16, a-c: withdrawal grooves (a) and (b), threaded
bores (c), grooves for oil distribution, fig. 7.13.

-- 78 of 792 --

79
Medium and small-sized bearings which are
mounted with a tight fit are dismounted from the
shaft by means of a soft steel or copper mandrel
or by means of mechanical or hydraulic presses -
fig. 7.17, a-c.
To reduce the frictional force when dismounting
largesized bearings which were mounted on
shaft with tight fit, pressurized oil should be
introduced, as in case of mounting - fig. 7.11.
To dismount bearings with tapered bore which
were mounted directly on the shaft or bearings
which were mounted with withdrawal or adapter
sleeves, the nut axially fastened should be first
stripped. Then, dismounting is to be done by light
hammering on the inner ring by means of a soft
steel or copper mandrel, as shown in fig. 7,18 a
and b.
In case of bearings mounted with withdrawal
sleeves, a nut is to be screwed up to the threaded
part provided for this purpose, as shown in fig.
7.19, a and b.
In case of large-sized bearings, hydraulic devices
are used as in case of mounting.
Some solutions for dismounting bearings with
tapered bore mounted direclty on the shaft
spindle, with adapter or withdrawal sleeve are
given in fig. 7.20, a and b.

Deep groove ball bearing
Deep groove ball bearings consist of inner ring,
outer ring, cage and balls. They are manufactured
wide range, both of standard and special design.
Single Row Ball Bearings
Single row deep groove ball bearings are
particularly multi purpose. They are simple in
design, non-separable. Deep groove ball bearings
can take double direction radial and axial loads
and also allow good operation at high speeds. If
they are produced with precision class, They are
suitable for very high speeds. They are requiring
little maintenance.
Therefore, single row deep groove ball bearings
are the most widely used bearing type.
Deep groove ball bearings are classified as follows:
• Miniature ball bearings : to 3.175 mm
(including) inner bore diameter
• Extra small ball bearings : from 3.175 mm
(over) to 9.525 mm (including) inner bore
diameter
• Deep groove ball bearing : from 9.525 mm
(over) inner bore diameter.
Single row deep groove ball bearings are
manufactured in many constructive versions as
shown below.
• Open Basic Design Type
• Shielded Types
• Sealed Types
• Bearings with snap ring groove, with or
without snap ring types
• Paired Type
DAS LAGER can produce inch-
size bearings and bearings with/or
without a tapered bore (See figure1).
These variants are not included in
this General Catalogue. Information
will be provided on request.
Open Basic Desing Type
DAS LAGER basic design single row deep grove
ball bearing are open. They are simple design
without any seal, shield, snap ring groove and
snap ring. (See figure 2)
Sometimes for manufacturing reason, open
desing bearing's rings are also produced UG
design, with grooves on the outer ring and WL
design, with grooves on both rings are also used
for the purpose of mounting seals or shields on
the bearings. (see figure 2-(a)(b) )
Shielded Type Single Row Deep Groove Ball
Bearings
Bearings with shields, designation suffix Z or
2Z. Depending on the bearing series and size are
produced in one of two designs (see figure 3). The
shields are made of sheet steel and normally have
a cylindrical extension in the shield bore to form
a long sealing gap with the inner ring shoulder
(see figure 3a). Some shields do not have the
extension (see figure 3b).
In 	case 	of 	bearings 	with 	non-rubbing
shields,there is a small interstice between the
shield and the rib of the inner ring. Both sides
sheilded single row deep groove bearings are
manufactured in series and delivered filled with
lithium base grease and used at temperatures
between -30oC and +110oC, in accordance
with the specifications.(see Bearing lubrication
section). Bearings can also be greased with
special greases. The bearings with shields on both
sides are lubricated for life and are maintenance-
free. They should not be washed or heated to
temperatures above 80 °C.

Bearings with shields have been designed first
of all for cases when the inner ring rotates.When
the outer ring rotates, the lubricant can flow
out of the bearing at a certain speed. In such
cases, please consult DAS LAGER engineering
service
Shealed Type Single Row Deep Groove Ball
Bearings
Bearings with shields, designation suffix RS
or 2RS. Depending on bearing application are
produced in one of two designs (see figure 4). The
seal made of synthetic rubber (Nitrile-Butadiene-
Rubber, in short NBR) and are suitable for
operating temperatures from –30°C to +120°C.
The gasoline and oil resistant elastic rubber lip
that/these are rubs on the groove on the inner
ring side (see figure 4a) or directly on the outside
surface (see figure 4b). The seals have integrated
steel washers to increase their rigidity.
Both sides sealed single row deep groove
bearings are manufactured in series are delivered
filled with lithium base grease and used at
temperatures between -30oC and +110oC, in
accordance with the specifications.(see Bearing
lubrication section). Bearings can also be greased
with special greases, The bearings with shields or
seals on both sides are lubricated for life and are
maintenance-free. They should not be washed or
heated to temperatures above 80 °C.
For special applications, however, seals are also
available in other materials.(see table 1).
For more information, please consult DAS
LAGER engineering service
Single Row Deep Groove Ball Bearing With
Snap Ring Grove:
Deep groove ball bearings, with snap ring
groove on the outer ring can be located in the
housing with snap rings. Because of their simple
and space saving mounting, these bearings
simplify the assembly design. The groove for the
snap ring and the snap rings are in accordance
with ISO 464 and tables 7 and 8 respectively.
DAS LAGER deep groove ball bearings with a
snap ring groove are supplied as:
• Open bearings, designation suffix N (see figure
5-a)
• Open bearings with a snap ring designation
suffix NR (see figure 5-b)
• Bearings with a Z shield at the opposite side
and a snap ring, designation suffix ZNR (see
figure 5-c)
• Bearings with a Z shield at the same side and a
snap ring, designation suffix ZNRB (see figure 5-d)
• Bearings with Z shields on both sides and a
snap ring, designation suffix 2ZNR (see figure 5-e)
Pair Single Row Deep Groove Ball Bearing
For 	bearing 	arrangements 	where 	the
load carrying capacity of a single bearing is
inadequate, or where the shaft has to be axially
located in both directions with a given amount of
axial clearance, DAS LAGER can supply matched
pairs of single row deep groove ball bearings to
order.
These bearings can be delivered matched in
pairs in three versions, as follows: DB (back-to-

values of clearance or preload are given in table
2. The producer marks "V" on the bearing outside
surface as shown in the next
figure, so that pired bearings
to be correctly mounted.(see
figure 7)
The multiple speed limit of
these bearings can be calculated
multiplying the speed of the
basic bearing by 0,8. Paired
bearings are packed and delivered in the same
box.
Stainless steel deep groove ball bearings
Deep groove ball bearings can made of stainless
steel
Dimensions
The overall dimensions of deep groove ball
bearings are in accordance with the stipulations
of ISO 15.
Misalignment
Single row deep groove ball bearings have only
limited ability to accommodate misalignment.
The permissible angular misalignment between
the inner and outer rings, which will not produce
inadmissibly high additional stresses in the
bearing, depends on
• The radial internal clearance of the bearing in
operation,
• The bearing size,
• The internal design and
• The forces and moments acting on the bearing
Because of the complex relationship between
these factors, no generally applicable specific
values can be given. However, depending on the
various influences of the factors, the permissible
angular misalignment lies between 2 and 10
minutes of arc. It must be considered, however,
bearings which run misaligned are subjected to
considerable additional forces that will shorten
their service life and generate high running noise.
Tolerances
Deep groove ball bearings are generally
manufactured to the normal tolerance class P0.
DAS LAGER single row deep groove ball bearings
are also available with accuracy completely to P6
or P5 tolerance class specifications. The values of
tolerances are given in on page 24.
Radial and axial clearance
"Deep groove ball bearings are generally
manufactured with normal radial clearance.
On request, they can also be manufactured
with radial clearance different from the normal
one, according to ISO 5753. The values of radial
clearance are given in table 1.
Paired bearings can be manufactured with axial
clearance (suffix A) or preloaded (suffix L). Values
for axial clearance and preload are given in table 2.

Cage
Deep groove ball bearings are generally fitted
with cages of pressed steel sheet.
Cages of glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 are
also suitable if the operating temperature doesn't
exceed +120ºC. They have reduced weight,
low coefficient of friction and are noiseless in
operation. Large-sized bearings are fitted with
machined brass cages.
Cage design and some technical data are given
in table 3."
Bearing minimum radial load
A minimum load must be applied on a deep
groove ball bearing so that they can operate
correctly, especially in case of operating under
heavy loads.
The forces of inertia which occur in bearing
as well as the friction in lubricant influence
negatively the operating conditions and can
cause detrimental sliding movements between
balls and raceways.
Minimum radial load depends on the bearing
size, speed and lubricant viscosity at operating
temperature. It can be roughly calculated from
the equation:
Frmin = 0,01 Cr, (Cr = basic dynamic radial
load)."

Equivalent dynamic radial load
Deep groove ball bearing can take also radial
and axial combined loads.
For deep groove ball bearings, single
or paired in tandem arrangement DT,
equivalent dynamic radial load can be
calculated using the equation:
Pr = Fr , kN, when Fa/Fr ≤e
Pr = XFr +YFa, when Fa/Fr>e
The greater the axial load, the greater
the contact angle of these bearings.
Factor e, X and Y depend on the ratio
f0Fa/C0r. Factor f 0 can be determined
using the diagram in the bellow figure,
as a function of dimension series and
mean diameter (d+D)/2. Fa is the axial
and C0r is the static basic load of the
bearing.
The values of factors e, X, Y which
depend on the bearing clearance can be
determined from table 4, coresponding
to the values of the ratio f 0Fa/C0r. The
values in table 4 apply to bearings
mounted with normal fit, i.e. shaft manufactured
to tolerance class j5 or k5 and housing in J6,
respectively.
Table 3

-- 85 of 792 --

86
For bearings matched in DB or DT arrangement,
equvalent dynamic radial load can be calculated
using the equation:
Pr=Fr+Y1Fa, kN when Fa/Fe ≤e
Pr= 0,75Fr + Y2Fa, kN when F1/Fr>e.
The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2, as functions of
ratio Fa/C0r are given in table 5.
Equivalent static radial load
For deep groove ball bearings, single or
matched in tandem (DT), equivalent static load
can be calculated using the equations:
P 0 = Fr, kN, when Fa/Fr≤0,8
P0 = 0,6Fr+0,5 Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr>0,8
For bearings matched in DB or DF arrangement,
it can be calculated from
P0 = Fr+1,7 Fa, kN.
Axial load
If deep groove ball bearings are purely axial
loaded, the axial load should not exceed 0,5 C 0r, In
case of small-sized bearings and bearings of light
series (diameter series 8, 9, 0 and 1), the axial load
should not exceed 0,25 C0r.
Heavy axial loads cause a significant decrease of
bearing rating life. In such cases, we recommend
you to consult our experts

General
DAS LAGER produce small and medium sized
deep groove ball bearing, including thin section
bearing in stainless steel.
These bearing have rings and balls made from
high - chromium alloy stainless steel.
The cage material for bearings with pressed cages
is also stainless steel.
The DAS LAGER stainless steel bearings feature
similar load ratings as the standard bearings made
from normal bearing steel.
DAS LAGER Stainless steel bearings are resistant
to humidity, water, steam and many alkaline
solutions.
The resistance to acids, however, is limited. It is
dependant upon the individual operating conditions
(i.e. acid concentration and its temperature).
In some applications, using sealed stainless steel
bearings also the resistance of the lubricant used
and the seal material must be considered.
Design variants
DAS LAGER stainless steel deep groove ball
bearings are standard open design.
Sealed (suffixes RSR or .2RSR) or Shield versions
(suffix ZR or .2ZR) are also produced to order request.
Single Row Deep Groove Ball
Bearing - Stainless Steel Series
Tolerances
DAS LAGER stainless steel deep groove ball
bearings are produced to normal tolerance class
(PN) as standard.
The dimensional tolerance values are listed in the
chapter “Bearing tolerances” on page 27.
Cages
DAS LAGER stainless steel deep groove ball
bearings are fitted with pressed stainless steel cages
are standard.
There are several bearing types, cage designs and
materials available on request.
Internal clearance
The DAS LAGER range of stainless steel deep
groove ball bearings are produced with normal
internal clearance (CN) as standard.
Other internal clearance groups may be produced
upon request (i.e. C2 or C3 etc).
The values of internal clearance groups are as for
standard deep groove ball bearings according to DIN
620/part 4 and ISO 5753-1981, respectively.
Designation
DAS LAGER - Stainless Steel Deep groove ball
bearing are identified by a prefix “SS” (SS stands for
“Stainless Steel”).

A single row deep groove ball bearing with filling
slots has a filling slot in both the inner and outer rings
enabling more and larger balls to be incorporated
than in standard deep groove ball bearings. (see
figure 1). Because of that they have special cage
design. Filling slot bearings have a higher radial load
carrying capacity than bearings without filling slots,
but their axial load carrying capacity is small.
They are also unable
to operate at such high
speeds 	as 	bearings
without filling slots. The
standard assortment of
DAS LAGER deep groove
ball bearings with filling
slots comprises
DAS LAGER single row
deep groove ball bearing
with 	filling 	slot 	are
manufactured 	following
constructive versions.
• Basic design open bearings
• Shielded bearings
• Bearings with a snap ring groove.
Basic design bearings
Basic design bearings with
filling slots are open without any
seal and shield. Those bearings
that are also produced in shielded
version may have seal recesses in
the outer ring, for manufacturing
reason.(see figure 2).
Shielded bearings
DAS LAGER deep groove ball bearings with filling
slots are available with shields on one side designation
suffixes ZR (see figure3-a) or both sides, designation
suffixes 2ZR (see figure3-b). The shield forms a narrow
gap to the inner ring shoulder (see figure 3).
Single Row Deep Groove Ball
Bearing - with filling slots
Bearings up to and including sizes 217 and 314 are
filled with a high-quality NLGI class 2 grease with
polyurea thickener, for a temperature range of -30°C
to +150°C. The base oil viscosity is 115 mm2/s at 40°C
and 9,4 mm2/s at 100°C.
The quantity of grease fills some 25 to 35% of the
free space in the bearing. The bearings are lubricated
for life and are maintenance-free. They should
therefore not be washed or heated above 80°C
before mounting.
Bearings with a snap ring groove
For easy, space saving axial location of the bearing
in the housing, DAS LAGER deep groove ball
bearings with filling slots are available with a snap
ring groove in the outer ring, designation suffix N
(see figure 4-a). The appropriate snap ring is shown in
the product table with designation and dimensions
and may be supplied separately or already mounted
on the bearing, designation suffix NR (see figure 4-b).
DAS LAGER deep groove ball bearings with filling
slots and a snap ring groove can also be supplied with
a shield on the side opposite the snap ring groove (see
figure 5-a) or with two shields (see figure 5-b).

Dimensions
The boundary dimensions of DAS LAGER deep
groove ball bearings with filling slots are in
accordance with ISO 15:1998.
The dimensions of the snap ring groove and snap
rings follow ISO 464:1995.
Tolerances
DAS LAGER deep groove ball bearings with
filling slots are produced to Normal tolerances. The
tolerances are in accordance with ISO 492:2002 and
can be found in table 3.1/3.2 on page 27.
Internal clearance
DAS LAGER single row deep groove ball bearings
with filling slots are manufactured with Normal
radial internal clearance. The values for radial internal
clearance are provided in tab. 1 on page 83. They are
in accordance with ISO 5753:1991 and are valid for
unmounted bearings under zero measuring load.
Misalignment
The conditions concerning misalignment of the
outer ring with respect to the inner ring are the
same for deep groove ball bearings. However, the
filling slots limit the angular misalignment may
lead to the balls running over the edges of the
filling slot. This will cause increased bearing noise
and reduced bearing service life.
Cages
DAS LAGER deep groove ball bearings with
filling slots are fitted with a pressed riveted steel
cage, ball centred, no designation suffix (see
figure 6).
Minimum load
In order to provide satisfactory operation, deep
groove ball bearings with filling slots, like all ball
and roller bearings, must always be subjected to
a given minimum load, particularly if they are to
operate at high speeds or are subjected to high
accelerations or rapid changes in the direction of
load. Under such conditions, the inertia forces of the
balls and cage, and friction in the lubricant, can have
a detrimental influence on the rolling conditions in
the bearing arrangement and may cause damaging
sliding movements to occur between the balls and
raceways.
The requisite minimum radial load to be applied
to deep groove ball bearings with filling slots can be
eatimated using
where
Frm 	= minimum radial load
k r 	= minimum load factor
0,04 for bearings in the 2 series
0,05 for bearings in the 3 series
ν 	= oil viscosity al operating temperature,
mm 2/s
n 	= rotational speed, r/min
dm 	= bearing mean diameter
= 0,5 (d+D), mm
When starting up at low temperatures or
when the lubricant is highly viscous, even greater
minimum loads may be required. The weight of the
components supported by the bearing, together
with external forces, generally exceeds the requisite
minimum load. If this is not the case, the deep groove
ball bearing must be subjected to on additional
radial load.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
P = Fr + Fa
provided Fa/Fr≤0,6 and P≤0,5 C0.
If the axial load Fa>0,6 Fr then deep groove ball
bearings without filling slots should be used instead.
Equivalent static bearing load
P 0=Fr + 0,5 Fa
provided Fa/Fr≤0,6.

Double row deep groove ball bearings (see figure1)
have similar constructive design to single row
deep groove ball bearings. They have two deep
raceways and high conformity between the balls and
raceways. They are able to carry axial loads acting in
both directions in addition to radial loads. Double
row deep groove ball bearings
are very suitable for bearing
arrangements where the load
carrying capacity of a singlerow
bearing 	is 	inadequate. 	For
the same outside and bore
diameters, double row bearings
are slightly wider than single row
bearings but have considerably
higher load carrying capacity
than single row bearings in the
62 and 63 series.
Design:
DAS LAGER Double Row Deep groove ball bearings
have the latest design (suffix B) without filling slots.
Thus they are able to support thrust loads equally
well in both directions.
But, it must be considered that some of these
bearings may have filling slots which limit the ability
to support thrust loads in the direction of these
filling slots.
Tolerances
DAS LAGER double row deep groove ball bearings
are produced to Normal tolerances. The values for
tolerances correspond to ISO 492:2002 and can be
found in table 3.1 on starting page 27
Internal clearance
DAS LAGER double row deep groove ball bearings
have Normal radial internal clearance as standard.
The clearance limits are as specified in ISO 5753:1991
and can be found in table 1on page 83.
Double Row Deep Groove Ball
Bearing
Misalignment
Misalignment of the inner ring relative to the outer
ring of a double row deep groove ball bearing can
only be accommodated by force, which leads to
increased ball loads and cage forces and a reduction
in bearing service life. For this reason, the maximum
permissible angular misalignment is two minutes of
arc. Any misalignment of the bearing rings will result
in increased noise during operation.
Cage
DAS LAGER double row deep groove ball bearings
are fitted with two glass fibre reinforced polyamide
6,6 cages, designation suffix TN
These bearing sizes are also available with pressed
steel cages.
Minimum load
In order to obtain satisfactory operation,
double row deep groove ball bearings, like all
ball and roller bearings, must be subjected to a
given minimum load, particularly if they are to
operate at high speeds or are subjected to high
accelerations or rapid changes in the direction
of load. Under such conditions the inertia forces
of the balls and cages, and the friction in the
lubricant, can have a detrimental effect on the
rolling conditions in the bearing arrangement
and may cause damaging sliding movements to
occur between the balls and raceways.
The requisite minimum load to be applied to
double row deep groove ball bearings can be
estimated using
Figure 1

-- 135 of 792 --

136
where
Frm = minimum radial load, kN
kr = minimum radial load factor (from product table)
v = oil viscosity at operating temperature, mm2/s
n = rotational speed, r/min
dm = bearing mean diameter = 0,5 (d + D), mm
When starting up at low temperatures or when the
lubricant is highly viscous, even greater minimum
loads may be required.
The weight of the components supported by the
bearing, together with external forces, generally
exceeds the requisite minimum load. If this is not the
case, the double row deep groove ball bearings must
be subjected to additional radial load.
Axial load carrying capacity
If double row deep groove ball bearings are
subjected to a purely axial load, this axial load
should generally not exceed the value of 0,5 C0.
Excessive axial loads can lead to a substantial
reduction in bearing life.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
For dynamically loaded double row deep
groove ball bearings
P = Fr 	when Fa /Fr ≤ e
P = 0,56 Fr + YFa 	when Fa /Fr > e
The factors e and Y depend on the relationship
f 0 Fa /C0 where f0 is a calculation fact or (see
product table), Fa the axial component of the
load and C 0 the basic static load rating.
If the bearings are mounted with the usual fits
(shaft tolerance j5 or k5, depending on the shaft
diameter, and housing bore tolerance J7) the
values for e and Y given in table 1 can be used to
calculate the equivalent load.
Equivalent static bearing load
For statically loaded double row deep groove
ball bearings
P 0 = 0,6 Fr + 0,5 Fa
If P0 < Fr , 	P0 = Fr should be used.

Four-point contact ball bearings, also called
“Duplex Bearings”. Four-point contact ball bearings
are radial single row angular contact ball bearings
with raceways that are designed to support axial
loads acting in both directions.Therefore require
significantly less space in an axial direction than
double row designs.
The bearings consist of solid outer rings, split inner
rings and ball and cage assemblies with brass or
polyamide cages. Due to the two-piece inner rings,
a large number of balls can be accommodated. The
halves of the inner ring are matched to the specific
bearing and must not be interchanged with those
of bearings of the same size. The outer ring with the
ball and cage assembly can be fitted separately from
the halves of the inner ring.
DAS LAGER four-point contact ball bearings of the
QJ design have a contact angle of either 35° or 45°.
The inner ring is split. This enables a large number of
balls to be incorporated in the bearing thus giving
the bearing high load carrying capacity.
Design variants
Four Point contact ball bearings are frequently
used to accomodate thrust loads only.
To avoid unforeseen radial loading to the bearing
they used to be mounted either reduced outside
bearing ring diameters or to oversized housing seats.
To prevent the outer ring from rotating with the
shaft, four point contact ball bearing outer rings are
often produced with locating slots.
For this reason, DAS LAGER four point contact
Four Point Contact Ball Bearings
bearings with outer diameters of more then ф160
mm are produced with two locating slots in their
outer ring (suffix N2).
Special series of four point contact ball bearings
are available on request represented by the series
QJ 10 and four point contact ball bearings with split
outer ring (Series Q).
Misalignment
Four point contact ball bearings are less suitable to
operate with misaligments.
When there are used in combination with a radial
bearing as pure thrust bearings, however, they must
not be exposed to any misalignment.
Tolerances
DAS LAGER four point contact ball bearings are
produced to normal class tolerance (PN) as standard.
Upon request they can produce more precision P6
and P5 class. The values of tolerances are given in on
page 27.
CAGE
DAS LAGER four-point contact ball bearings are
can produce following cages designs
• Machined solid brass cages with suffix MA
• Moulded polyamide cage suffix TN
• Machined light metal alloy solid cage suffix L
Internal Clearance
Four point contact ball bearings are produced to
axial clearance group CN (Normal) as standard.

Special clearance
For applications not covered by the standard
clearances groups or where bearings with standard
clearances do not achieve optimum perform, DAS
LAGER four point contact ball bearings may also be
supplied with special internal clearances.
Example:
A80.150 	Special axial internal clearance.
Axial clearance of;
80 to 150 microns (μm)
If required, the range of internal clearance values
may be grouped to a specific part within a clearance
group.
Example:
C2L 	axial clearance reduced to the
Lower part of the C2 clearance
group.
Minimum load
Four point contact ball bearings are suitable to
operate at high speeds. For optimum contacting
behaviours, however, four point contact ball bearings
should be mainly exposed to axial acting loads.
An effective function is given, when
Fa ≥ 1,27 * Fr
If this ratio is not attained or achieved high sliding
friction may occur in the bearing and thus generate high
noise and excessive wear.
To function effectively, four point contact bearings
should run under minimum bearing load of
approximately 2 per cent of the dynamic load rating (Cr).
Equivalent dinamic bearing load
In the case of four point contact ball bearings the
following formula should be used:
when
Fa/Fr ≤ 0,95 then P = Fr + 0,66 * Fa
or, when
Fa/Fr > 0,95 then P = 0,6 * Fr + 1,07 * Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
P0 = Fr + 0,58 * Fa
Abutment and fillet dimensions
Four point contact ball bearings are often used
to accommodate thrust loads, so they do require
optimum support of the bearings rings by the
machine components surrounding the bearing.
To gain adequate support the shaft and housing
shouders required a certain minimum height.
The bearing rings, however, must only contact
adjacent parts with there side faces.
DAS LAGER also produce four point contact ball
bearings with enlarged (axial clearance groups C3 or
C4) and/or with reduced axial clearance (Clearance
group C2) on request.
Values for these clearance groups are listed in
table below.

-- 142 of 792 --

143
The radii of bearings corners must not touch
the corner fillet radii of either the shaft or housing
shoulders. Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg or
rg1, respectively) must always be smaller than the
minimum fillet dimensions of the bearing rings (r s).
Recommandations for the dimensions of adjacent
parts listed in DIN 5418, the values for the bearing
fillet dimensions are stated in the bearing tables.

Double Row Angular Contact Ball Bearing
Single row angular contact ball bearings are
rigid, non-separable radial bearings. They have
raceways in the inner and outer rings that are
displaced with respect to each other in the
direction of the bearing axis. They are suitable for
high-speed applications and can accommodate
both radial and thrust forces including combined
loads and tilting moments.
In case of single row angular contact ball
bearings, the efforts between rings and rolling
elements (contact points of rolling elements /
outer or inner ring) are transmitted at an angle
α (<90°) to a plane perpendicular to the bearing
axis.
The value of this angle depends on the
magnitude of the raceway radius, rolling element
diameter and radial clearance in bearing, when
the curvature centres of the raceway in the outer
or in the inner ring are in the same plane.
As single row angular contact ball bearings
accept thrust loads in one direction only, they
must be used in pairs where there are both side
thrust load. The axial load carrying capacity of
angular contact ball bearings increases with
increasing contact angle. The higher contact
angle the better the ability for accepting thrust
loads.The contact angle α is defined as the angle
between the line joining the points of contact
of the ball and the raceways in the radial plane,
along which the load is transmitted from one
raceway to another, and a line perpendicular to
the bearing axis (see figure1).
DAS LAGER single row angular contact ball
bearings are produced with several different
contact angles, these contact angles are
identified by the suffixes (see table 1)
Single row angular contact bearings are
manufactured in various constructive versions,
with various contact angles, depending on the
application(see figure 2). Bearings series 72B and
73B for general applications have a contact agle
α= 40°.
Bearings series 718, 719, 70 and 72 generally
used for tool-holders. Those with bore diameters
up to d = 100 mm are manufacturedto tolerance
classes P5, P4 and P2 and have a contact angle
of 15° suffix code (C) and 25° suffix code (AC)
respectively. Standard bearing have a contact
angle is 30 o and suffix code (A). Therefore the
code "A" will usually be omitted.

BE Desing: (see figure 3)
DAS LAGER single row angular contact ball
bearings, series 72 and 73 are also produced with
a reinforced internal design, suffix code BE.
The use of larger ball sizes in BE-design bearings
allows for significantly higher load ratings when
compared to “conventional” design bearings
white maintaining the same overall dimensions
Bearing Pair
Single row angular contact ball bearings in
universal design usually used in pairs or sets(see
Figure3). Paired mounting is used when the load
carrying capacity of a single bearing is inadequate
(tandem arrangement) or when combined or
axial loads act in both directions (back-to-back
and face-to-face arrangements).
DT: Tandem arrangement (see figure 4-a)
When arranged in tandem the load lines are
parallel and the radial and axial loads are equally
shared by the bearings. However, the bearing
set can only accommodate axial loads acting in
one direction. If axial loads act in the opposite
direction, or if combined loads are present, a
third bearing adjusted against the tandem pair
must be added.
DB: Back to Back Arrangement (see figure 4-b)
The load lines of bearings arranged back-to-
back diverge towards the bearing axis. Axial loads
acting in both directions can be accommodated,
but only by one bearing in each direction.
Bearings mounted back-to-back provide a
relatively stiff bearing arrangement that can also
accommodate tilting moments.
Bearing pairs arranged back-to-back are not
able to compensate for misalignments.
DF: Face to Face Arrangement (see figure 4-c)
The load lines of bearings mounted face-to-
face (fig) converge towards the bearing axis.
Axial loads acting in both directions can be
accommodated, but only by one bearing in each
direction. This arrangement is not as stiff as the
back-to-back arrangement and is less suitable for
the accommodation of tilting moments.
The contact lines of DF arrangement converge
towards the bearing axis and form letter “X“. Axial
loads are taken in the same way as in case of DB
arrangement, but the arrangement is not so stiff
and it is less suitable for taking tilting moments.
For 	bearing 	pairs 	arranged 	face-to-face
temperature increase of the shaft causes a
reduction of axial internal clearance or an
increase of preloading forces, respectively.

Internal Clearance and Preload
DAS LAGER single row angular contact ball
bearings in universal design, with normal
bearing mounting fits, are matched in sets or
pairs, respectively, to give a defi ned axial play or
preloading, respectively.
The “normal” fits are:
- Shaft fits: j5
- Housing fits: J6
DAS LAGER universally matchable bearings
are produced in three different clearance and
preload classes each. The classes for bearing sets
with clearance are
– CA - smaller than Normal axial clearance
– CB - Normal axial clearance (standard)
– CC - larger than Normal axial clearance.
DAS LAGER universally matchable bearings
with clearance can be combined in sets of any
number of bearings.
The classes for bearing sets with preload are
– GA - light preload (standard)
– GB - moderate preload
– GC - heavy preload.
Internal clearance in single row angular contact
ball bearings is only obtained after mounting and
is dependent on adjustment against a second
bearing, which provides axial location in the
opposite direction.
Designs of single row angular contact ball
bearings with clearance or initial preload are
given in the figures below.

Dimensions
Main dimensions of bearings given in tables
are in accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
In case of single row angular contact ball
bearings the conditions regarding the permissible
error of alignment of the outer ring relative to the
inner ring are as complex as for single row deep
groove ball bearings.
When 	the 	bearings 	are 	paired 	in 	DB
arrangement, angular misalignments of the
outer ring in relation to the inner ring can only be
accommodated between the balls and raceways
by force, leading to a reduction in bearing life.
Tolerances
Single row angular contact ball bearings of
series 72B and 73B, with a contact angle α= 40°
Cages
Single row angular contact ball bearings series
72B and 73B are generally fitted with pressed
sheet cages.
High precision single row angular contact ball
bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A are fitted
with textolite cages (textile fibre reinforced
phenol resins).
At special request (high speeds, large sizes),
bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A are fitted
with machined brass cages. Cages of glass fibre
reinforced polyamide 6.6 are also used with good
results if operating temperature doesn’t exceed
+120 °C.
Cages design and some technical data are given
in table 5
(B) are generally manufactured to the normal
tolerance class.
On request, they also can be manufactured to
normal tolerance classes P6 and P5.
Single row angular contact ball bearings of
high accuracy, series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A,
with a contact angle α= 15° (C) and α= 25° are
manufactured to tolerance classes SP, P4, UP
and P2.
The deviations of bore diameter, outside
diameter and width of high accuracy single row
angular contact ball bearings of universal design
(UL) are given in table 4.
In case of single row angular contact ball
bearings manufactured and delivered in sets of 2,
3 or 4 bearings, outside and bore diameter should
be chosen considering the mean tolerance
values, which are given on the package.

Equivalent dynamic radial load
For single row angular contact ball bearings
series 72B and 73B, single and in tandem
arrangement the following equations are used:
Pr = Fr , kN, 	when Fa/Fr ≤ 1,14,
Pr = 0,35 Fr + 0,57 Fa , kN, when Fa/Fr > 1,14
For bearings in DB or DF arrangement
Pr = Fr + 0,65 Fa , kN when Fa/Fr ≤ 1,14
Pr = 0,57 Fr + 0,93 Fa , kN, when Fa/Fr > 1,14
In case of paired bearings, Fr and Fa are the loads
acting upon the bearings pair.
As the load is transmitted from one raceway to
the other under a certain angle to the bearings
axis, the actual load will cause an axial load.
This has to be considered when calculating the
equivalent dynamic load, in case of two single
bearings or tandem arrangements. The equations
needed for calculation are given in table 6, for
various arrangements and loading versions.
These equations are available for bearings
mounted without clearance and without preload
(clearance equal to zero).
For single row angular contact ball bearings
series 70C and 72C with a contact angle α =
15 °(C), single or in DT arrangement, the following
equations are available:
Pr = Fr , kN, 	for Fa/Fr ≤ e,
Pr = 0,44 Fr + Y Fa , kN, 	for Fa/Fr > e
The values of factor Y depend on the values
of the ratio f 0 i Fa/C0r and are given in table 7.
Factor f 0 can be found in diagram in page 156 as
a funtion of dimensions series and bearing mean
diameter. “i“ represents the number of bearings
or bearings pairs in a bearing stack.
For bearings in DB and DF arrangements, the
following equations are available:
Pr = Fr + Y1 Fa, kN, 	for Fa/Fr ≤ e,
Pr = 0,72 Fr + Y2 Fa , kN, 	for Fa/Fr > e
The values of factors Y 1 and Y 2 depend on the
ratio f 0iFa/C0r and are given in table 7 (f 0 from
diagram below).

equation is available:
P 0r = 0,5 Fr + 0,38 Fa , kN
For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the
following equation in available:
P0r = Fr + 0,76 Fa , kN
Two “V“ scratches are marked on the outside
surface where the runout is maximum, i.e. where
the outer ring thickness is maximum, so that
the bearings of a set can be mounted in the
manufacturing order. The place of maximum
runout is marked on the chamfer between the
inner ring bore and side face. Thus, the possible
fit ovalnesses on the shaft can be compensated.
Every set is delivered as an unit, separately
packed.
If distance rings are necessary to be mounted
between bearings, they have not to be adjusted
when being mounted. There is only one
condition to be observed: the inner distance
ring width should be equal to that of the outer
ring, the side faces being parallel to each other.
This can be easily done if both distance rings are
simultaneously ground on a grinding and lapping
machine. If bearings are mounted with distance
rings, the mounting is also done observing the
“V“ marked as mentioned above. The cone vertex
should be on the ring side oposite to that one on
which the load acts (see next figure).

Basic dynamic load of paired bearings
Basic dynamic load given in bearings tables
is valid for each single bearing. Basic dynamic
load of a paired bearings set can be determined
according to the specifications on page 20.
Basic static load of paired bearings
Basic static load of paired bearings can be
similarly determined, multiplying the values of
C 0r in the tables by 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
Bearing speed limit
Single row angular contact ball bearings are
used at high speeds.
High precision bearings allow operation at
higher speeds than those in the catalogue,
depending on the oil lubrication system (oil bath,
dropping lubrication, oil spot, with oil cooling).
The values of speeds for bearings series 72B and
73B, normal tolerance class, without preload are
given in this catalogue.
In case of preloaded bearings, for single
mounted bearing and bearings in DB, DF or DT
arrangements, speed should be multiplied by the
coefficients in table 8.
For bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A,
speeds are given for the tolerance class P4 and
light preload.
In case of bearings with other values of
preloads or arrangements of 3 or 4 bearing sets,
the speeds of the bearing of basic design should
be multiplied by the values of the coefficients in
table 8.

Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on the
shaft and housing shoulder respectively, shaft
(housing) maximum connection radius r u max
should be less than bearing minimum mounting
chamfer r 1min., r2min.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
The values of the connection radii and support
shoulder height are given in table 9.

Double Row Angular Contact Ball Bearing
DAS LAGER double row angular contact ball
bearings correspond in design to two single row
angular contact ball bearings in the back-to-
back arrangement but take up less axial space.
There is a narrower profile for the same bearing
size. They can accommodate radial loads as well
as axial loads acting in both directions. They
provide stiff bearing arrangements and are able
to accommodate tilting moments.
Bearing Series 52xx & 53xx
Standard design of 32xx & 33xx series identical to
corresponding bearings in the 52xx & 53xx series.
They have same performance characteristics and
dimentional features (except for the widht of size
5200). But they have different grease. Series 52xx
& 53xx use a mineral oil based high temperature
grease with polyurea thickener.
Desing Variants
Double row angular contact ball beairngs
with Filling Slot: (see figure 1-a)
Double row angular contact ball bearings have
a contact angle of 32° and a pressed steel cage
and filling slots on one side.
These bearings must be mounted in such a
way that the large thrust force acts towards the
raceways without the filling slots. These designs
are designated by the suffix E
Angular contact ball
bearings, double row
Standart Double row angular contact ball
bearings : (see figure 1-b)
Standard Double row angular contact ball
bearings do not have such filling slots and are
capable of accommodating thrust forces equally
well in both directions.
They have contact angles of 32° and are
fitted with polyamide cages; these designs are
designated by the suffix (B-TN).
Standard design are available with shields suffix
B-TN-2Z (see figure 1-c) or with two contacting
seals, (suffix B-TN-2RSR), (see figure 1-d) fitted on
both sides.
Double row angular contact ball bearing
with two-piece inner ring: (See figure 1-e)
In addition to the basic design bearings,
double row angular contact ball bearings are
also available with a two-piece inner ring. These
bearings incorporate a large number of large
balls and have a high load carrying capacity,
especially in the axial direction.
These bearings provide a very rigid bearing
arrangement, and are capable of accommodating
thrust forces equally well in both directions. This
bearing design is identified by the suffix D.

Dimensions
Main bearing dimensions given in tables are in
accordance with ISO/R15.
Misalignment
Double row angular contact ball bearings must
not be exposed to any misalignment. Angular
misalignment of the outer ring, relative to the
inner ring, is accommodated by force between
the balls and raceway. This leads to a shortening
of bearing life.
Tolerances
Double row angular contact ball bearings are
generally manufactured to the normal tolerance
class. Upon on request they can produce P6, P5
tolerans class. Bearing tolerance are given on
page 27.
Axial clearance
Double row angular contact ball bearings
series 32 and 33, with a contact angle α= 32 0
are generally manufactured with normal axial
clearance. They can also be manufactured with
smaller or larger axial clearances.
Double row angular contact ball bearings series
33D, with a contact angle α= 450 are generally
mounted on the shaft with greater tightening
than those of series 33. For this reason, the axial
clearance is larger.
The values of axial clearance of the double row
angular contact ball bearings are given in table 1.
Cages
Double row angular contact ball bearings series
32, 33 are fitted with machined brass cages.
Glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages are
also used with good results.
Large-sized bearings are fitted with pressed
sheet cages.
Cage design and some technical data are given
in table 2.
Minimum Load
Bearings require a minimum load under all
operating conditions to ensure kinematically
correct rolling element function.
For DAS LAGER double row angular contact ball
bearings the minimum load must be 1% of the
dynamic load rating.

Angular contact ball bearings, double row

191
Self aligning ball bearings are non-separable
double row radial bearings. Both rows of balls
rotate, in parallel, within the spherical outer
ring. This feature allows angular misalignment of
the shaft relative to the housing. Therefore self-
aligning ball bearings are particularly used in
case of bearings where misalignment can occur
from errors in mounting or from shaft bending.
Self aligning ball bearings are suitable for low to
medium radial loads and low amounts of thrust
forces.
Additionally, the self-aligning ball bearing has
the lowest friction of all rolling bearings, which
enables it to run cooler even at high speeds.
Double row self-aligning ball bearings are
manufactured both with cylindrical bore (see
figure 1-a) and tapered bore (taper 1:12) (see
figure1-b).
Upon request self-aligning bearings with
tapered bore can be delivered with adapter
sleeves (see figure 1-c) and extended inner ring
(see figure 1-d).
Self-aligning ball bearings
Self -aligning Ball Bearings with Extended
Inner Ring: (see figure 1-d)
Self -aligning ball bearings with extended inner
ring of series 112 and 113 are used in applications
where high accuracy is not necessary and
generally, they can be mounted directly on rolled
shafts. The bore manufactured to tolerance class
J7 allows fast mounting and dismounting. The
inner ring has a groove for bearing axial location
which can be done by means of a screw or pin.
Self aligning ball bearings with Seal: (see
figure 2)
Self aligning ball bearings are also available
in a sealed version with seals at both sides
(suffix 2RS). The seals are made of gasoline, oil
and wear-resistant synthetic rubber. Sealed
bearings are delivered filled with a certain
grease quantity. Sealed bearing operating
temperatures are between -300C and +800C.
Grease sevice life is much reduced if bearing
operates at a temperature higher than +800C
(see page 64). Sealed bearings are greased for the
entire operating period, relubrication not being
necessary. Sealed bearings washing or heating
before mounting in assembly is not allowed.
Self aligning ball bearing with seal are available
tapered inner ring (see figure 2-b).
Dimentions
Overall dimensions of self-aligning ball bearings
are in accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
The design of self-aligning ball bearings is such
that angular misalignment between the outer and
the inner rings can be accommodated without
any negative effect on bearing performance.
Self-aligning ball bearings allow within certain
limits an angular misalignement of the outer ring
in relation to the inner ring. Approximate values
for permissible misalignment, under normal
operating conditions are given in table 1.

Tolerances and radial clearance
Bearings of serial production are manufactured
to normal tolerance class and with normal
radial clearance. Tapered bore bearings of serial
production are also manufactured with radial
clearance C3.
Self-aligning ball bearings with extended inner
ring are manufactured with radial clearance C2
and normal clearance.
On request, these bearings can also be
manufactured to other tolerance classes and with
smaller or larger radial clearance.
The bore of self-aligning ball bearings with
extended inner ring is manufactured to tolerance
class J7.
Bearing tolerances are given on page 24 and
the values of radial clearance are given in tables
2 and 3.

Pr = 0,65 Fr + Y2 Fa, kN 	when Fa/Fr >e,
The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2 which depend
on bearings are given in bearing tables.
Equivalent static radial load
P0r = Fr + Y0 Fa, kN
The values of the factor Y 0 which depends on
bearing are given in bearing tables.
Axial load on bearings with adapter sleeves
If self-aligning ball bearings are mounted with
adapter sleeves on smooth shafts, without side
location, their axial carrying capacity depends on
the friction between the sleeve bore and shaft.
Permissible axial load can be precisely enough
determined using the equation:
Fa max = 3 B d,
where:
Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, N
B - bearing width, mm
d - bearing bore diameter, mm
Cages
Self-aligning 	ball 	bearings 	are 	generally
fitted with presses steel cages of sheet. On
special request, when bearings operate under
fluctuating loads, at high speeds and where large
sizes are required, machined brass cages are
recommended to be used. Glass fibre reinforced
polyamide 6.6 cages are also suitable if the
operating temperatures do not exceed +120 0C.
They have low weight, a low coefficient of friction
and are noiseless while running.
Cage design and technical data are given in
table 4.

Special characteristics
In case of some dimensions of self-aligning
ball bearings series 12 and 13, the balls protrude
somewhat from the bearing, as shown in the

Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on
the shaft shoulder and housing shoulder
respectively, maximum connection radius r u max.
of shaft (housing) should be less than minimum
mounting chamfer r s min of bearing.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
In case of self-aligning ball bearings with
tapered bore which are mounted directly on a
tapered shaft or with an adapter sleeve, proper
tightening and minimum radial clearance of 10-
20 μm should be assured for normal clearance
and of 20-55 μm for clearance C3, depending
on bearing size and series. The values of the
connection radius and support shoulder height
are given in table 6 and mounting dimensions for
bearings mounted with adapter sleeves are given
in table 7.

Spherical roller bearings
Spherical roller bearings are self aligning and
very strurdy. The bearings consist of two row
spheric rollers because of these bearings can
carry heavy radial and combined axial loads in
both directions simultaneously. Due to their poor
kinematic behaviours, spherical roller bearings
are only suitable for operating at low to medium
speeds. It's most suitable for applications where
some misalignment is unavoidable. According
your application, they are aviable either
cylindrical and tapered bores.
Spherical Roller bearings are manufactured in
the following constructive version, depending on
bearing size and serie.
C CAGE DESIGN:
C cage consist of special pressed sheet cage.
These bearings have a central guide rib floating
on the inner ring,This design change eliminates
the guide flanges on the bearing inner ring and
uses symmetrical rollers with larger dimensions.
So that the load carrying capacity increases. C
cage mostly suitable for small and medium sizes
spherical roller bearings.
MB CAGE DESIGN:
These bearings have a central fixed rib and two
pieces machined brass cages guided on the inner
ring rib.
MA CAGE DESIGN:
These bearings have a central fixed rib and two
pieces brass machined cages guided on the outer
ring rib.
CA CAGE DESIGN:
These bearings have side shoulders and an
one-piece machined brass cage. They also have
symmetrical rollers with larger dimensions so
that the load carrying capacity increases. This
design is available for medium and large-sized
bearings.
They are frequently used with tapered bores (i.e.
taper 1:12) namely suffi x K or for series 240 and
241 the taper bore is (1:30) namely suffix K30, for
ease of mounting. The facility of mounting these
bearing types using adapter and withdrawal
sleeves enables mounting directly onto drawn or
fine turned seats of shaft for applications where
high running accuracy is not necessary.
For some applications it remains necessary
to mount tapered bore bearings directly onto a
tapered seat of the shaft.

Misalignment
Spherical 	roller 	bearings 	allow 	angular
misalignment between the outer ring and inner
ring without any influence on the bearing rating
life. Under normal loads and operating conditions
and when the inner ring rotates, the values of the
permissible misalignment depending on the
bearing series are given in table 3.
Cages
Small and medium size spherical roller bearing
are fitted with pressed sheet or machined brass
cages (Y). Bearings of normal design are fitted
with machined brass or steel cages guided on the
rollers (M), inner ring (MB) or outer ring raceway
(MA).
Glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages are
successfully used for small and medium size
bearings if the operating temperature doesn't
exceed +120°C.
Large-size bearings are fitted with machined
brass cages, CA design.
Designs and some technical data are given in
table 4.

Spherical roller bearings are provided with a
lubrication groove and holes in the outer ring,
excepting those of series 213. Designation suffix
W33 is used to identify this feature on bearings.
The dimensions of the groove, bore diameter and
their number depending on the dimension series
are given in table 5.
Axial load for bearings mounted on adapter
sleeves
If the spherical roller bearings are mounted on
a smooth shaft using an adapter sleeve, without
side support, the axial load carrying capacity
depends on the friction between shaft and
sleeve.
Considering that the mounting is correctly
done, the permissible axial load can be accurately
enough determined using the following equation
Fa max = 3 B d, kn
where:
Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, kN;
B - bearing width, mm;
d - bearing bore diameter, mm.
Equivalent dynamic radial load
Pr=Fr+Y1Fa, kN, for Fa/Fr≤e
Pr=0,67 Fr+Y2Fa, kN, for Fa/Fr>e
The values of the factors depending on the
bearing type can be found in bearing tables.
Equivalent static radial load
P0r=Fr+Y0Fa, kN

Torodial roller bearings
DAS LAGER torodial bearings combine the self-
aligning ability of the spherical roller bearing with
the axial displacement ability of the cylindrical
roller bearing.
They are specially using as non-locating
bearings and as such they are excellent with
their combination of self-aligning and axial
displacement properties.
Torodial bearings have high load carrying
capacity where it has to compensate for angular
misalignment or axial displacement.
Toroidal roller bearings are produced to two
basic designs; bearings with cage, and full
complement bearings. The full complement
bearings have higher load capasity than bearings
with cage design because the full complement
bearings have more rollers.
Both desings can produce with tapered bore
1:12 ( suffix code K) and 1:30 (suffix code K30)

Internal Clearance:
The torodial bearings can produce different
radial clearances. Table 1 show the radial internal
clearance of torodial bearing with cylindrical bore
and Table 2 show the radial internal clearance of
torodial bearings with tapered bore
Mostly torodial bearing are used spherical roller
bearings. The clearance is slightly larger than that
of corresponding spherical roller bearing have
the same clearance class. An axial displacement
of the inner ring relative to the outer ring of 6 to
8 % the bearing width will reduce operational
clearance to approximately the same value as a
spherical roller bearing of the same size.
Misalignment
Without any negative effect on bearing, an
angular misalignment between the inner ring and
outer ring can be 0,5°. For higher misalignment
than 0,5°. The bearing internal fraction will
increase so it will effect of bearing life. For above
0,5° misalignment please contact DAS LAGER
enginering service.
For MB cage type an angular misalignment
shoud never exceed 0.5°

Table 2: Radial internal clearance of torodial bearings with a tapered bore
Axial Displacement
Torodial bearing are suitable axial displacement
of shaft. The axial displacement can result
from thermal expansion or deviations from
determined bearing positions.
The bearing radial clearance depend on bearing
misalignment and axial displacement .
To calculate bearing axial displacement and
radial clerance limit. Please contact your DAS
LAGER engineer service
Minimum Load:
The torodial bearings, like all ball and roller
bearings, must always be subjected to a given
minimum load.
If they are to operate at high speeds or are
subjected to high accelerations or rapid changes
in the direction of load. it’s possible to cause
damaging sliding movements to occur between
the rollers and raceways.
Frm = 0,007 C0
For a full complement bearing using
Frm = 0,01 C0
Frm : minimum radial bearing load [kN]
C0 : basic static load rating [kN] (see product data)
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Torodial bearings can only accommodate radial loads
P = Fr
Equivalent static bearing load
Torodial bearings can only accommodate radial
loads P 0 =Fr

Cylindrical roller bearings
Single 	row 	cylindrical 	roller 	bearings 	are
manufactured in several basic separable designs,
with different guide flange locations to achieve a
variety of capabilities. In case of cylindrical roller
bearings, the rollers are laterally guided by the
fixed ribs of one ring. Cylindrical roller bearings are
especially suitable for use in applications with heavy
radial loads, high speeds, and where interference fits
are required on both bearing rings.
DAS LAGER single or more rows cylindrical roller
bearings are manufactured in various constructive
versions, depending on the position of the ribs on
rings. The four basic designs (NU, NJ, N and NUP) are
given in the bearing following.
NU
Bearings of NU design have two fixed ribs on the
outer ring and one smooth inner ring. This design
allows an axial displacement in certain limits, of the
shaft in relation to the housing. Therefore, these
Roller bearings are used in non-locating bearing
units.
N
Bearings of N design have two fixed ribs on the
inner ring and one smooth outer ring. This design
allow an axial displacement in certain limits, of the
shaft in relation to the housing. Therefore, these
Roller bearings are used in non-locating bearing
units.
NJ
Bearings of NJ design have two fixed ribs on the
outer ring and a fixed rib on the inner ring which
can guide the shaft in a single direction (axially).
NUP
Bearings of NUP design have also two fixed ribs
on the outer ring and, on the inner ring, a fixed rib
and a support washer. This way they can be used
as locating bearings, guiding the shaft axially in
both directions.
For a shaft guiding in a single direction, it
also can be used a bearing of NU design which
is combined with a support washer. Thus, the
constructive version NUJ is obtained.Support
washers on both sides of a bearing of NU design
are not allowed as they lead to an axial blocking
of the rollers.
NNU49- NN30:
Double or more rows cylindrical roller bearings
have small sections, high load carrying capacity
and stiffness.These bearings provide high
stiffness and maximum load carrying capacity
and are particularly used for tool holders of the
machinetools and rolling mills.
FULL COMPLEMENT:
Cylindrical 	roller 	bearings 	without 	cage
incorporate the maximum number of rollers and
have a small section in relation to their width. This
provides a high load carrying capacity and allows
space-saving designs to be achieved. Cylindrical
roller bearings without cage cannot be used
at speeds as high as those with cages. These
bearings are manufactured with single or more
row rollers and suffix V is added to the bearing
designation. The most utilized bearings are those
of series NCF29 V, NCF30 V and NJ23VH

Dimensions
The main dimensions of standardized bearings
given in tables are in accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
The modfied contact between rollers and
raceway allows not only peripheral stresses to
be avoided but also, in case of single row roller
bearings, permits an angular misalignment of
the outer ring with respect to the inner ring,
depending on the bearing series and load
according to the table 1.
Tolerances and radial clearance
Single row cylindrical roller bearings are usually
manufactured to normal tolerance class with
normal radial clearance.
They can also be manufactured to more
accurate tolerance classes and with larger (C3NA
and C4NA) or smaller (C1NA and C2NA) radial
clearances.
Tolerances of cylindrical roller bearings are
given on pages 27.
Radial clearances according to international
standard ISO 5753 are given in tales 2
and 3 for cylindrical bore bearings both
with 	interchangeable 	rings 	and 	with
non-interchangeable rings (NA).

1) Radial clearance for bearings with tapered bore is staggered with one group to the right, for example radial
clearance C3NA for cylindrical bore bearings match radial clearance NA for tapered bore bearings.
Cages
Small and medium-sized single row cylindrical
roller bearings are generally fitted with pressed
sheet cages.
Large-sized bearings are fitted with machined
brass cages of normal design, i.e. cages of
separable design guided on rolling elements M,
on the outside surface MA or inner surface MB.
In case of heavy loads and high speeds, cages
are made in one piece.
Glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages, are
succesfully used for small and medium-sized
bearings, if the operating temperature doesn’t
exceed + 120 0
C. These cages have low weight,
low coefficient of friction and are noiseless while
running.
Cage design and some technical data are given
in table 4.

Minimum load
Cylindrical roller bearings must be subjected to
a given minimum load, so that a proper operation
of these bearings can be guaranteed.
This is necessary especially as the bearings
are operated at high speeds and the centrifugal
forces produce additional friction in bearing due
to the sliding between rollers and raceway.
The values of the minimum load can be enough
accurately calculated using the equation:
Frm = 0,02 Cr
, kN

Equivalent dynamic radial load
For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially
loaded 	which 	don’t 	locate 	shafts 	axially,
equivalent dynamic load is:
Pr = Fr
, kN
If cylindrical roller bearings have ribs on the
outer and inner rings and locate shafts axially in
one or both directions, equivalent dynamic load
can be calculated using the equations:
Pr = Fr , kN, 	when Fa
/Fr ≤ e
Pr = 0,92 Fr + Y Fa
, kN, 	when Fa
/Fr > e
where:
e - calculation factor with values:
- 0,2 for series 10,2,3 and 4
- 0,3 for series 22,23
Y - factor for axial load
- 0,6 for series 10,2,3 and 4
- 0,4 for series 22,23
Cylindrical roller bearings axially loaded run
satisfactorily only if they are simultaneously
radially loaded. Ratio Fa
/Fr should not exceed
0,5 for bearings of E design and 0,4 for the other
bearings.
Equivalent static radial load
For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially
loaded, equivalent static load is:
P0r = Fr
, kN
Dynamic axial load
Bearings with ribs on the outer ring can
accommodate 	axial 	loads 	in 	addition 	to
radial loads. The axial load carrying capacity
of cylindrical roller bearings do not depend
essentially on the steel fatigue strength, but on
the resistance of the sliding surfaces at the roller
end and rib contact and therefore on lubrication,
operating temperature and bearing thermal
conductivity.
Considering the above mentioned, axial load
carrying capacity of a cylindrical roller bearing
can be enough accurately calculated using the
following equation:
F n (d 	D)
k 	k F ,	C 10
a max 	1 	2 r
	0r 	4
= + -
where:
Fa max 	- maximum permissible axial load, kN
C0r 	- radial static load, kN
Fr 	- radial load component, kN
n 	- operating speed, r/min
d 	- bearing bore diameter, mm
D 	- bearing outside diameter, mm
k1 	- auxiliary factor, see table 5
k2 	- auxiliary factor, see table 5
The above equation is based on conditions
which are considered typical for normal bearing
operation:
- a difference of 600
C between the bearing
operating temperature and the ambient
temperature
- a specific heat loss from the bearing of
0,5 mW/mm 2 0
C
- a viscozity ratio k=2.
The viscosity ratio k is the ratio of the actual
viscosity at the operating temperature to the
requisite viscosity for a proper lubrication at that
temperature. Further details can be found in
subchapter “Adjusted rating life”, life adjustment
factor a 23 - on page 21.
In case of grease lubrication, the base oil
viscosity of the grease should be used. These
effects can be reduced at low speeds by using oils
with EP additives.

The values of permissible axial load Fa max
obtained from the equation above mentioned
are valid for a continuously acting constant axial
load. If axial loads act only for short periods, the
values may be multiplied by 2 or for shock loads
by 3.
The constantly acting axial load Fa max (N) should
never exceed the numerical value of 1,2 D 2
(D = bearing outside diameter, mm) and
occasional shock loads should never be greater
than the numerical value of 3D2
.

-- 360 of 792 --

361
In case of heavy axial loads (Fa > D2
), the ribs
of the outer and inner ring respectively are
recommended to be supported by the bearing
adjoint parts. Bearings of NUP and NJ+HJ designs
which take axial loads in both directions are to be
placed so that main axial loads should be taken by
fixed ribs, if bearing design allows.
Heat treatment
Cylindrical roller bearings with outside diameter
D > 240 mm of all series given in the catalogue
are to be subject to a heat treatment of stress
relieving which allows bearings to be operated
up to a temperature of +150 0
C.
The hardness of rigs should not be less 59 HRC.
Small-sized bearings operate normally up to
+120 0
C.
Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on the
shaft and housing shoulder respectively, shaft
(housing) maximum radius ru max should be less
than bearing minimum mounting chamfer rs min
.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
The values of the connection radius and
support shoulder height are given in table 6.

Double row cylindrical roller bearings are
frequently used as non - locating bearings
arrangements. They provide very rigid and
stiff bearing arrangement. They have low cross
section and high load carry capacity. NN type
and NNU type are widely used for applications
requiring thin-walled bearings, such the main
shafts of machine tools, rolling machine rollers,
and in printing equipment
NN 30 Series: (see table1 figure 1)
Bearings of series NN 30
comprise of a plain outer
ring and an inner ring with
three 	integral 	shoulders
to guide the two separate
rows of rollers around the
raceway.
NNU 49 series: (see table1 figure 2)
The NN49 series hava
outer ring with 3 integral
shoulders 	around 	the
raceway and a plain inner
ring.
NNCL Series: (see table1 figure 3)
NNCL 49 series have have an inner ring
with three fl anges and a plain outer ring. The
outer ring features two
retaining rings sitting in
circumferential grooves on
either side of the raceway
diameter to retain the outer
ring and bearing assembly.
NNCL 49 series are unable to accommodate any
axial forces. These bearings allow a compensation
for changes in length caused by thermal
expansion of the shaft due to the outer ring’s
positional movement. This makes them optimum
nonlocating bearings.
NNCF 50 Series: (see table1 figure 4)
NNCF 50 series also feature three fl anges on
the inner ring but only one flange on the outer
ring. On the outer ring side opposite to the flange
they feature a retaining ring
sitting in a circumferential
groove to fix the outer.
This bearing type is able to
accommodate minor axial
forces in one direction only
and allows a compensation of length changes
caused by thermal expansion of the shaft and the
outer ring’s positional movement
NNC 49 Series: (see table1 figure 5)
NNC 49 series double row cylindrical roller
bearings have three flanges on their inner ring
and an outer ring with a fl ange on one side and
a loose rib on the opposite
side. This allows them to
accommodate minor axial
forces in both directions.
Thus they may be used as
locating bearings.
NNF 50 Series: (see table1 figure 6)
NNF design bearings (fig)
in the NNF 50 and 3194(00)
series are always sealed
on both sides and filled
with grease. The two-piece
inner ring has three integral
flanges and is held together by a retaining ring.
The outer ring has an integral central flange. The
bearings can be used to locate a shaft axially in
both directions. Because of the large distance
between the two rows of rollers, the bearings are
also able to accommodate tilting moments.
The bearings have a contact seal on both sides.
The seals are retained on the inner ring shoulders,
to provide efficient sealing at this position. The
outer sealing lip exerts a slight pressure on the
outer ring raceway. The operating temperature
range for the seals is –40 to +80 °C.
Sealed NNF design bearings are filled with
greases. They are maintenance-free, but if they
operate in a moist or contaminated environment,
or if speeds are moderate to high, they must be
relubricated

Misalignment
Double Row Cylindrical Roller bearings are not
able to accomodate misalignments.
Minimum load
The minimum load applied to fast rotating
double row cylindrical roller bearings should be
higher than 4 % of its dynamic load rating Cr.
Equivalent Dynamic bearing load
For non-locating bearings
P = Fr
If double row full complement cylindrical roller
bearings with flanges on both inner and outer
rings are used to locate a shaft in one or both
directions, the equivalent dynamic bearing load
should be calculated using.
P = Fr 	when Fa
/Fr ≤ 0,15
P = 0,92 Fr + 0,4 Fa when Fa
/Fr > 0,15
Since 	axially 	loaded 	double 	row 	full
complement cylindrical roller bearings only
operate satisfactorily when they are subjected to
a simultaneously acting radial load, the ratio Fa
/Fr
should not exceed 0,25.
Equivalent static bearing load
“For Single and Double row cylindrical roller
bearings:”
P0 = Fr
Abutment and fillet dimensions for Double
row cylindrical roller bearings
The bearing rings must only contact adjacent
parts with their side faces. The bearing corners
must not touch the corner fillet radii or either
the shaft or housing corners.
Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of
the bearings rings (rs) as listed in the bearing
tables, also see next page.
Recommendations for the dimensions of
adjacent parts are listed in DIN 5418.

Four Row Cylindrical
Roller Bearings
DAS LAGER four-row cylindrical roller bearings
are used almost exclusively for the roll necks of
rolling mill stands, calenders and roller presses.
Their friction is low compared with other roller
bearings. As they are normally mounted with
an interference fit on the roll neck, they are
particularly suitable for rolling mill applications
where the rolling speed is high.
The low bearing cross section allows for
relatively large roll neck diameters in comparison
with the roll diameter. Since very many rollers can
be incorporated, the radial load carrying capacity
is exceptionally high.
DAS LAGER four-row cylindrical roller bearing
are only able to accommodate radial loads.
They are therefore mounted together with deep
groove or angular contact ball bearings, or with
tapered roller bearings, either radial or thrust
designs, which take up the axial loads.
Internal clearance
DAS LAGER four-row cylindrical roller bearing
are normally produced with the C3 or C4 radial
internal clearance required for rolling mill
bearings. Bearings mounted with a loose fit on
the roll necks generally have C2 radial internal
clearance.
The clearance values, where standardized,
conform to ISO 5753:1991 and are given in the
following tables for bearings with cylindrical bore
and bearings with tapered bore. They are valid for
unmounted bearings under zero measuring load.

1) Radial clearance for bearings with tapered bore is staggered with one group to the right, for example radial
clearance C3NA for cylindrical bore bearings match radial clearance NA for tapered bore bearings.
Working temperature:
DAS LAGER multi-row cylindrical roller bearings
are subjected to a special heat treatment
as standard so that they can be operated
at temperatures up to +150°C without any
inadmissible dimensional changes occurring.
To order, and against a surcharge, bearings
can be dimensionally stabilised for operating
temperatures up to +200°C (designation suffix
S1) or up to +250°C (designation suffix S2). An
advantage of this special heat treatment is that
the bearings can be mounted with a greater
degree of interference than is possible with
standard bearings. For further information please
contact the DAS LAGER application engineering
service.
Cages :
DAS LAGER four-row cylindrical roller bearings,
depending on size and also application, are
produced with the following cages:
Two or three double pronged machined brass
cages
Two double row window-type brass cages
Four pronged machined brass cages

Minimum load :
In order to guarantee satisfactory operation, DAS
LAGER multi-row cylindrical roller bearings,like all
ball and roller bearings, must always be subjected
to a given minimum load, particularly if they are
to operate at high speeds or are subjected to high
accelerations or rapid changes in the direction of
load. Under such conditions the inertia forces
of the rollers and cage, and the friction in the
When starting up at low temperatures or when
the lubricant is highly viscous, even greater loads
may be required. The weights of the components
supported by the bearing, together with the
external forces, generally exceed the requisite
minimum load. If this is not the case, the ADAS
LAGER multi-row cylindrical roller bearing must
be subjected to an additional radial load.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load: P = Fr
Equivalent static bearing load: P0 = Fr
Mounting 	instructionsKnowledge 	and
experience are of particular importance where
DAS LAGER four-row cylindrical roller bearings
are concerned. The individual components
must be mounted in the correct order. Parts
which belong together are marked with letters.
In addition, all components of the bearing are
marked with the same serial number, so that
there is no risk of mixing components if several
bearings are to be mounted at the same time.
lubricant, can have a detrimental effect on the
rolling conditions in the bearing arrangement
and may cause damaging sliding movements to
occur between the rollers and the raceways.
The requisite minimum load to be applied
to multi-row cylindrical roller bearings can be
estimated using:
However, the inner rings and inner ring pairs are
fully interchangeable and need not to have the
same serial number as the outer ring(s).
In the majority of applications the load is of
constant direction, so that approximately only
a quarter of the outer ring is under load. For
this reason, the side faces of the outer rings are
divided into four zones indicated by I to IV. The
markings for load zone I are also joined by a line
across the outside surface of the outer rings.
When the bearing is mounted for the first time
it is usual to position zone I in the direction of
action of the load. Depending on the operating
conditions, the outer rings should be turned
through 90°after a period of service so that a new
zone comes under load.
Detailed 	mounting 	instructions 	are 	also
supplied with all bearings.

501
Support rollers
Depending on their desing Support Rollers are
radial needle roller or cylindrical roller bearings
with an extra radially thick outer ring. Depending
on their desing, support rollers may be both
separable and non -separable radial bearings.
Support Rollers usually run with their outer
ring either directly on a guide track or against a
machine surface that is for guidance. Due to their
extra - thick outer rings, Suport rollers are able to
accept high radial forces as well as shock loads.
Their ability to accomodate axial forces,however,
depends on the particular design of the support
roller.
Support roller are usually exposed to minor
misalignments during operation. To minimize
the negative effects of such misalignments, (e.g.
high edge stresses), support rollers are more
frequently used with sphered outer rings.
If support rollers outer ring is cylindrial. It’s
indicated by the the suffix “”X”” (See table 1)
Design:
DAS LAGER Support rollers are available in
several different design variants as standard.
Support Rollers without axial guidance
Support rollers without flange rings 	are
designed for applications where associated
components limit axial movement of the outer
ring. Based on needle roller bearings, these
support rollers are available with or without
an inner ring. Support rollers with an inner ring
have an inner ring that is slightly wider than the
outer ring to avoid axial clamping of the outer
ring. Support rollers without an inner ring are
intended for arrangements where the pin or shaft
is hardened and ground.
STO and RSTO Type Support Rollers: (See
table 1)
STO design support rollers have an inner ring,
while RSTO design support rollers do not have an
inner ring. Both designs are only available as open
support rollers (without seals). The components
can be mounted separately, but the outer ring
and the needle roller and cage assembly must
always be kept together as supplied.
NA22.. 2RS and RNA22.. 2RS: (See table 1)
NA 22...2RS type support rollers have an inner
ring, while RNA 22...2RS type support rollers don’t
have an inner ring.
The inner ring of NA 22…2RS type support
rollers can be mounted separately from the outer
ring, roller and cage assembly.
Due to the contact seals, which are integrated
in their outer rings, NA 22 ..2RS - type support
rollers provide the possibility for maintenance
free bearing arrangements.
Table 1

-- 501 of 792 --

502
Support Rollers with axial guidance
These types of supporting rollers are also to
accommodate additional thrust loads as they
occur, due to aligning errors or if rollers run out
of line. That is why no extra external guiding
surfaces are required.Where high axial loads
are anticipated effective axial support of side
washers must be achieved by the adjacent
machine components.
STO..2Z Type: (See Table 2)
STO...2Z - type support rollers are designed
similar to the STO - type but have two loose side
plates to accept axial forces.
These types of support rollers are separable,
this enables simple mounting of the rollers due
to the separable parts.
Particular attention must be paid to the
adequate axial camping of loose side washers
during mounting.
The side plates of STO...2Z - type support rollers
must not have any axial play when they are
mounted.
NATR and NATR..PP Type: (See Table 2)
The side washers of NATR - type needle roller
support rollers are pressed into the inner ring to
ensure guidance of the outer ring and the needle
roller and cage assembly.
Therefore, these roller types are non - separable.
NATR - type needle roller support roller are
optimum for applications where the rollers are
exposed to high radial loads at high speeds.
The sealed support rollers, namely, NATR..
PP, which feature integrated rubbing seals on
each side of the outer ring are very suitable for
operating in harsh conditions (e.g. heavy dust,
dirt and other contaminates).
NATV and NATV..PP Type: (See Table 2)
NATV-type rollers are identical to the NATRtype
except they have no fitted cage (i.e. full
complement type).
This enables an increased numbers of needle
roller to be fitted in the available space (i.e.full
circumferentially 	and 	radially). 	Therefore,
significantly higher “”basic”” load ratings are
achived.
NATV type full complement rollers are
unsuitable for high speed applications due to
the differing kinematic operating condition. Also
they must be re-lubricated more frequently.
For applications of harsh operating conditions
the sealed support roller, namely, NATV...PP is also
available.
NUTR - type : (See Table 3)
The base internal design of NUTR - type
support rollers is similar to that of double row full
complement cylindrical roller bearings without
an integral flange between the two roller sets.
The outer ring has two integral flanges to axially
guide the roller sets. A loose flange ring on both
sides of the inner ring provides axial guidance for
the outer ring via the roller sets.
This enables NUTR .. A design support rollers
to accommodate relatively heavy axial loads that
are induced when operating in an inclined or
tilted position.
For extra heavy duty applications, particularly
where heavy shock loads occur NUTR - type
support rollers are available with an extra - radialy
thick walled outer ring (see sketch).
NUTR - type support rollers are non separable.
The separate loose ribs of these type are retained
using either cupped washers pressfitted into the
outer ring or with lamellar rings which sit in the
formed circumferential grooves machined in the
loose rib outer diameter.
Both methods also act as a gap seal.
Due to do their full complement design, NUTR
-type support roller feature a maximum load
rating but they must be more frequently re-
lubrication.
DAS LAGER’s extra heavy duty NUTR -type
support rollers with increased outer ring
wall thickness are identified by the fact that
their nominal diameters are included in their
designation.
Examples:
NUTR 2562 or NUTR 4090.

Material of seals
Several types of DAS LAGER support rollers,
such as series NA22...2RS, NATR .. PP und
NATV...PP are also available in sealed versions.
These support rollers feature contacting seals
made from wear - resistant synthetic rubber
compound (NBR) that provides an efficient
and effective seal against the penetration of
impurities or the escape of grease.
The synthetic rubber used for these contacting
seals is satisfactory for operation temperatures of
-30°C up to +120°C.
Grease filling
All DAS LAGER Support rollers are already
supplied filled with a high quality, lithium -
soaped bearing grease as standard.
This lubricant is adequate for operating
temperatures of -30°C up to ca. +110°C.
Although support rollers under normal operating
conditions usually run maintenance - free, they
may require more frequent re - lubrication under
certain 	unfavourable 	operating 	conditions
such as heavy dust, high speeds, permanent
operating temperatures of more than 70°C, and
the presence of increased humidity etc.
Therefore a support rollers feature a lubrication
hole in the inner ring to provide the possibility of
re-lubricating the rollers, when necessary.
It must be considered where relubrication is
necessary, with a satisfactory grease, the force
of pressure to re-grease must be of a level not to
cause permanent damage to either the seals or
shields.
DAS LAGER also produce roller with alternative
grease fill according to customer's specification
upon order request.
Cages
Support rollers, with cages fitted, have normally
pressed steel cages as standard. Only small
support rollers without axial guidance, series
STO and RSTO, respectively, are fitted with solid
polyamide cages (suffix TN), as standard.
Tolerances
DAS LAGER support rollers are produced
to normal tolerance class (PN) as standard,
according to DIN 620 - standard.
The exceptions being the outer ring outer
diameter tolerance of crowned outer rings and
the width tolerance of supporting roller of series
STO ...2Z, NATR, NATV and NUTR.
The tolerance for the outer ring diameter of
support rollers with sphered outer ring is uniform
at:
0 / -0,05 mm
The width tolerance of support rollers of series
STO ...2Z, NATR, NATV and NUTR is lateral and
lies in the ISO - tolerance field h12.
The tolerance for the inside diameter of the
needle roller complement, (F), of RSTO and
RNA 22...2RS - type support rollers that are used
without inner rings, is lateral in the ISO - tolerance
field F6.
Values of ISO - tolerance field F6 and h12
are listed in the table 1. For detailed values of
tolerances to DIN 620 see chapter "Bearing
tolerances" page 27.
Internal Clearance
Support rollers are produced to normal internal
clearance group (CN) as standard according to
DIN 620.
Load carrying capability
Unlike "normal" rolling element bearings, the
outer ring of support rollers contact the adjacent
parts with a very small contacting surface only.

505
Table 3

-- 505 of 792 --

506
This causes deformations of the outer ring.
These are considered by the recommended
maximum values for the permissible dynamic
and static radial loads as given by the product
tables.
Equivalent dynamic load
Where Support rollers must be calculated as
rolling element bearings:
P = Fr
But, P must be ≤ Fr zul
(for Fr zul see product tables)
Equivalent static bearing load
For Support rollers:
P 0 = Fr
But, P0 must be ≤ F0r zul
(for F 0r zul see product tables)
Design of adjacent machine components
For support rollers of the series STO, RSTO,
NA22..2RS and RNA22..2RS, an effective axial
guidance of the outer rings must be provided by
satisfactory designed surrounding parts.
These guiding surfaces must have a clean and
plain machined surface, minimum fine turned,
without any burrs.
These guide surfaces which are machined
should reach 50%, or greater, of the outer ring
radial wall section or the equivalent diameter.
Hardened guide surfaces, however, feature
a higher wear - resistance and may therefore be
smaller in diameter.
RSTO and RNA22..2RS - type support rollers
that run directly on a shaft require an axial play
of 0,2 mm minimum between the lateral guiding
surfaces in mounted condition.
The diameter of the supposed shaft raceway
should have a diameter tolerance according to
k5.
The shaft or pin have to fulfil certain
requirements in terms of hardness, dimensional
and geometric accuracy.
For detailed information on the design
requirements 	see 	the 	chapter 	"Bearing
application" on page 45.
For support roller which are exposed to high
axial loads, effective lateral support of their side
washers is necessary.
Since Support rollers usually have point loaded
inner rings, their shaft may be rather loose (i.e.
according to ISO - tolerance fields g6, h6 or j6).
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for Support
rollers
The bearing inner ring must contact adjacent
surfaces with their side faces only. The fillet radius
of inner ring corners must not touch the fillet
radius of shaft shoulder.
Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of
the Support roller inner rings (r s) as listed in the
product tables.

Cam Rollers
Cam rollers are non-separable radial bearings.
They are special variants of either radial deep groove
ball bearings or double row angular contact ball
bearings.
Cam rollers run either directly on a guide track
or against a surface that has been machined for a
guidance.
As cam rollers often run misaligned they are
generally used with crowned outer ring surfaces.”
Cam rollers normally run outside the machine
compartment, under extreme operating conditions,
in the presence of heavy contaminations (i.e.
dust and dirt, etc.). Because of that cam rollers are
produced and fitted with contacting seals.
Some types of the double row cam rollers are also
available with shields.
Desing
Cam rollers are readily available in several
design variants.
Single Row Cam Rollers
Cam rollers of the narrow series (series 3612..
and 3612.. R, are based on the proven sealed
single row deep groove ball bearings, (suffix .2RS)
for their internal design.
The DAS LAGER cam rollers, series 3612.. and
3612..R, respectively, are produced with .2RS.
- type contacting seals as standard. These seals
provide a very effective and efficient sealing of
the bearing compartment against penetration
by foreign particles even under unfavourable
operating conditions.
The narrow DAS LAGER cam rollers, series
3612 are available with either cylindrical (without
extra suffix) or crowned outer ring diameter
(suffix R) as standard.
The radius of crowning on single row cam rollers
for the series 3612.. R, is standardised at R = 400
mm, irrespective of their outer diameter.
Double Row Cam Rollers
The internal design of DAS LAGER double row
cam rollers (series 305 and 306) is based on the
double row angular contact ball bearings of the
series 32.. (for series 305) or 33.. (for series 306 cam
rollers), respectively.
Double row cam rollers have contact angles of 25°
they also feature polyamide cages as standard.
Double row cam rollers are widely used with
pressed steel shields, (suffix .2Z), they are also
available with rubbing seals (suffix .2RS) as
standard.
As for single row rollers, DAS LAGER double row
cam rollers are produced with either a cylindrical or
sphered outer ring diameters.
The radius of crowning of double row cam roller
outer diameter is also standardised at R = 400 mm.
Material of seals
For the contacting seal of sealed DAS LAGER -
cam rollers (suffix .2RS) a wear - resistant synthetic
rubber (NBR) is used as standard material.
This seal material is suitable for operating
temperatures of -30°C up to +120°C.
On request, the DAS LAGER - cam rollers are
supplied with alternative seal materials, such as high
- temperature FPM - contacting seals.
Grease filling
DAS LAGER cam rollers incorporating either
seals or shieds (suffixes) are supplied grease
filled from the factory with a proven high quality,
lithium soap based rolling bearing grease
suitable for operating temperatures of -30°C up
to +110°C.

-- 529 of 792 --

530
Although cam rollers, operating under normal
conditions, run generally maintenance free, some
application require additional lubrication where
high speeds, heavy dust, permanent operating
temperatures over 70°C exist.
Double Row cam rollers only feature a
lubrication hole in the inner rings to provide a
simple and effective relubricating method.
Where 	relubrication 	is 	necessary, 	it 	is
emphasised that, undue pressure by the
regreasing metgod may cause unnecessary
damage to either the seals or shields.
Cam rollers are supplied with special grease
fills according to customer specification or with
variable grease fill volumes than the standard.
Cages
Single Row Cam Rollers are standard fitted with
pressed steel cages as standard. Double row cam
rollers feature solid polyamide cages as standard.
Tolerances
Cam rollers, with cylindrical outer ring diameter,
are produced to normal class tolerances (PN) as
standard.
For cam rollers with sphered outer ring
diameters the outer ring diameter tolerance is
double the standard value.
For detailed tolerance values see in the chapter
“Bearing tolerances” page 27.

-- 530 of 792 --

531
Equivalent static bearing load
For Cam rollers:
P0 = Fr
But, P0 must be ≤ F0r zul
(for F 0r zul see product tables)
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for cam
rollers
The bearing inner ring must contact adjacent
surfaces with their side faces only. The radius of
inner ring corners must not touch the fillet radius
of the shaft shoulder.
Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of the
cam roller inner rings (r s) as listed in the product
tables.
Since cam rollers normally have point loaded
inner rings, their shaft fits may be rather loose,
(i.e. according to ISO - tolerance fields g6, h6 or
j6).
Internal clearance
DAS LAGER cam rollers are produced with
normal internal clearance group (CN) as
standard according to DIN 620.
DAS LAGER cam rollers are also produced to
other internal clearances.
Load carrying capability
Unlike the "normal" rolling element bearings,
the outer ring of cam rollers contact their adjacent
mating surface on a very small contacting area,
this causes deformations of the outer ring.
These 	deformations 	are 	considered 	by
the recommanded maximum values for the
permissible dynamic and static radial loads as
shown in by the product tables.
Equivalent dynamic load
Cam rollers must be calculated as rolling
element bearings:
P = Fr
But, P must be ≤ Fr zul
(for Fr zul see product tables)

Needle Roller Bearings
Needle roller bearings are roller bearings with
cylindrical rollers that are small in diameter. In spite
of their low cross section, needle roller bearings
have a high load carrying capacity and are therefore
extremely suitable for bearing arrangements where
radial space is limited.
Needle roller bearings are mostly use where minimal
space to carry a given load at a desired speed.
They are widely used with high reliability in the
fields of automobiles, industrial machinery, OA
equipment, etc. as resource-saving type bearings
that make the whole machine compact.
Radial Needle Roller and Cage Assemblies:
(See Table1)
Needle roller and cage assemblies are ready-
to-mount, self-contained bearing components.
They are an excellent choice for applications that
require a very rigid bearing arrangement as well
as a high load carrying capacity.
Radial needle roller and cage assemblies have
a steel cage that provides both inward and
outward retension for the needle rollers.
The desing provide maximum cage strength
consistent with inheretly high load rating of
needle roller bearings. Accurate guidance of
the needle rollers by the cage bars allows for
operation at high speeds. Also aviable are needle
roller and cage assemblies are manufactured
with either one and two rows need rollers.
If the shaft and housing bore can serve as
raceways, needle roller and cage assemblies
require minimal radial space.
Drawn Cup Needle Roller Bearings With
Open Ends: (See Table1)
They are characterized by a very low sectional
height and high load carrying capacity. Drawn
cup needle roller bearings are typically used in
applications where the housing bore cannot
be used as a raceway for a needle roller and
cage assembly, but where a very compact and
economical bearing arrangement is required.
The drawn cup of hardened steel and the
needle roller and cage assembly of these
bearings form a non-separable unit. The space
available for lubricant is large enough to enable
long relubrication intervals.
Typically, drawn cup needle roller bearings
have a single row of rollers. However, wide
sizes incorporate two needle roller and cage
assemblies immediately adjacent to each other
with a lubrication hole in the outer ring.
Needle Roller Bearings With Rings: (See Table1)
Needle roller bearings with rings have a low
sectional height and a very high load carrying
capacity for their size. They may be used with
or without an inner ring, depending on the
application.
Needle Roller Bearings with rings have an outer
ring made by machining, heat treatment, and
grinding. The outer ring has stable high rigidity and
can be easily used even for light alloy housings.
These bearings are available in various types
and optimally selectable for different conditions
such as heavy loads, high-speed rotation and
low-speed rotation. They are most suitable for
general-purpose applications.

Tolerans and Radial Clearance
DAS LAGER needle roller bearings bearings are
usually manufactured to normal tolerance class
with normal radial clearance(see Table 2).
They can also be manufactured to more
accurate tolerance classes and with larger (C3NA
and C4NA) or smaller (C1NA and C2NA) radial
clearances.
Shaft tolerance classes for needle roller bearings
without an inner ring
Minimum load
To achieve satisfactory operation, needle roller
bearings must always be subjected to a requisite
minimum load. Applying a requisite minimum
load is especially important for bearings that
operate at high speeds or are subjected to high
accelerations or rapid changes in the direction of
load. Under these conditions, not applying the
correct minimum load can result in damaging
sliding movement between the rollers and
raceways caused by the inertial forces of the
needle roller and friction in the lubricant.
The requisite minimum radial load to be applied
to needle roller bearings can be estimated using
Frm = 0,02 Cr
where
Frm = minimum radial load [kN]
Cr 	= basic dynamic load rating [kN]
When starting up at low temperatures or when
the lubricant is highly viscous, an even greater
minimum load may be required. However, the

Tapered roller bearings are separable radial
bearings. They consist of the inner ring with roller
set and cage assembly, (cone) and a loose outer ring
(cup). This bearing contains tapered rollers for its
rolling element which are guided by the inner ring
backface rib on the roller large end face.
Since outer ring is separable from the inner ring
assembly, the inner ring assembly can be installed
on the shaft and the outer ring in the housing,
individually.
This feature facilitates mounting of the bearing
while making the desing of the shaft and housing
simpler. In addition, more options regarding the
fitting practive employed are available than with any
other type of bearing.
Generally the bearings of unitized desing are
supplied with a predetermined radial clearance
which will varyy according to fitting practice and
application. Tapered roller bearings on the other
hand can be adjusted at the time of installation by
varying the axial location of either the inner ring
assembly or outer ring.
Tapered roller bearings are suitable for both radial
and thrust load but also accept combined loads
and tilting moments.This type
bearing is suitable for use under
heavy load or impact load.
Tapered roller bearings transfer
the loads acting on the bearing
at a certain angle, the so called
“contact angle α” towards the
shafts centre line (see fi g.1).
Mounted clearance is adjustable
In general, bearings of unitized design are
supplied with a predetermined radial clearance
which will vary according to fitting practice and
application. Tapered roller bearings on the other
hand can be adjusted at the time of installation
by varying the axial location of either the inner
ring assembly or outer ring.v
The ability of tapered roller bearings to
accommodate axial loads depends on their
contact angle α. The larger angle is better thrust
load capability. Mostyl contact angle of tapered
roller bearings are between 10° and 16°.
Tapered roller bearings of
the series 313 are particularly
suitable 	accommodate
axial loads due to their
comparatively large contact
angle (approximately 30°).
Taper roller bearing's most
important dimentions are
following: (see figure 2)
D The outside diameter of the outer ring, or
cup, is known as the O.D. (D)
C The outer ring width (cup width) is C
d The inside diameter of the inner ring, or cone
is called the bore (d)
B The cone widht is B
T When cup and cone are mated (including
rollers and cage), the overall dimension is
called the overall bearing width (T).
R The maximum shaft radius (R). Cone
radius
r The maximum housing radius (r). Cup
radius
DAS LAGER can produce many different types
of taper roller bearings. Mainly they can group as
follows.

Single row tapered roller bearings
Single row tapered roller bearings are of
separable design, i.e. the outer ring and the inner
ring with rollers and cage assembly can be be
separately mounted. These two assemblies are
interchangeable.
Tapered roller bearings can be manufactured
both in standardized constructive versions with
dimensions series 320, 302, 322, 303, 323, 313 and
with non-standardized dimensions, mm or inch.
Tapered roller bearings can carry only single
direction axial loads. Under pure radial loads, an
axial force occurs which is supossed to distance
the bearing ring in axial direction. Therefore,
tapered roller bearings are generally pair
mounted on both ends of the shaft, in "X" or "O"
arrangements, so that the shaft will be axially
located in both directions (table 4). Thus, the
optimum clearance in these two bearings can be
adjusted.
Single row tapered roller bearings can also be
manufactured with rib on the outer ring. This
design is to be used when the housing cannot
be manufactured with shoulder, but only with a
passed through bore. In this case, axial location
can be provided by the bearing ring.
Paired single row tapered roller bearing
If tapered roller bearings are pair mounted
in "X" or "O" arrangements, the load carryng
capacity increases and loads can be taken in both
directions in the same bearing.
These bearing sets have guaranteed clearance
after mounting since the distance rings are
mounted between the bearing rings.
For certain application, paired bearings can
be delivered with small clearance or lightly
preloaded.
Double row tapered roller bearings
Double row tapered roller bearings are used
where load carrying capacity should be greater,
loads should be taken in both directions and axial
space is smaller than in case of a set of two single
row tapered roller bearings.
Double row tapered roller bearings can have
the rollers in face-to-face arrangement, double
inner ring and two outer rings respectively or the
rollers in back to back arrangement i.e. double
outer ring and two inner rings.
The first design provides greater stiffness, can
take tilting moments and shaft expansions can
be compensated.
The bearings of the second design can be
manufactured with tapered bore so that they can
be frequently mounted / dismounted.
Double row tapered roller bearings can have
or not distance rings with lubrication holes,
mounted between the simple rings.
In case of bearings with distance rings, the
bearing clearance or preload are pre-adjusted;
in case of those without distance rings, bearing
clearance and preload can and should be
adjusted while mounting.
Double row tapered roller bearings with
rollers in back-to-back arrangement can also be
manufactured in the following two versions:
- with rib on the outer ring; the housing has no
shoulder and the bearing is axially located by the rib;
- with two seals; this design is used in motor
vehicles construction. The bearings are delivered
filled with grease and relubrication is not needed.
Dimensions
Tapered roller bearings are manufactured with
the following dimension:
- metric dimension (mm), according to ISO 355;
- inch dimensions
Misalignment
As between rollers and raceway there is a linear
contact, tapeed roller bearings have low capacity
to compensate for errors, of alignment between
shaft and housing.
Permissible values of misalignment between
shaft and housing are given in Table 1, depending
on bearing size and load magnitude.

Tolerances
Tapered 	roller 	bearings 	are 	generally
manufactured to the normal tolerance class ISO
and AFBMA, respectively (for bearings with inch
dimensions).
For certain applications (e.g. bearings for
machine-tools), they can be also manufactured
to tolerance classes P5 and P6X or 3 AFBMA.
On request, they can be manufactured to
tolerance class P4.
Single row tapered roller bearings have the
outer rings interchangeable with the inner ring
- rollers - cage assembly (if they have the same
mark) and also with bearings produced by
other companies, according to ISO and AFBMA
respectively.
The parts of the two and four row tapered roller
bearings are non-interchangeable.
The tolerances for bearings overall dimensions
are given in tables on the page 34 for tapered
roller bearings, both with metric and inch
dimensions. Tolerances for mounting chamfer are
given in tables on page 43.
Radial and axial clearance
In case of tapered roller bearings, clearance
should be in radial direction, but it is measured and
adjusted in axial direction. As tapered roller bearings
are dismountable, their clearance is not guaranteed
by design and it is adjusted while mounting.
Thus, optimum clearance can be obtained for that
application.
In case of double and four row tapered roller
bearings with distance rings between bearing rings,
the clearance is guaranteed and its values are given
in table 2. The bearing parts are numbered for each
bearing so that the prescribed clearance on each row
should be observed while mounting.
In case of bearings without distance rings, clearance
is adjusted as for single row tapered roller bearings: for
DB design - by the inner rings and for DF design by the
outer rings. The above specifications are also available
for bearings matched in sets.
The values of the axial clearance can be calculated
using the equation:
where a is the contact angle.
In case of certain applications where clearance
between shaft and housing should be avoided,
tapered roller bearings can also be pre-tightened.
This can be adjusted while mounting or is pre-
adjusted by distance rings, in case of two or four
row tapered roller bearings.
Contact angle of tapered roller beaings is the
angle of the outer ring raceway generatrix. In
case of standardized single row tapered roller
bearings, this angle can be found in the standard
of dimension ISO 355.
Bearing series 329, 302, 322, 303 and 323 have a
contact angle 10° and 17° and those of series 313
have a contact angle of 28° 48' 39'', so that they
can take heavier axial loads.
Non-standardized single row tapered roller
bearings and also all double and four-row
tapered roller bearings have the contact angle
between 90° and 30°.

Cages
Small and medium-sized tapered roller bearings
are generally fitted with pressed sheet cages.
Large sized bearings are generally fitted with
machined steel or brass cages, with welded pins.
In some cases, median or large sized bearings can
also be fitted with machined steel or brass cages.
In all cases, the cage is guided on rollers.
For small and medium sized bearings, glass
fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages can be
successfully used if the operating temperature
doesn't exceed +120°C. They have low weight,
are noiseless in operation an have low coefficient
of friction.
Design and some technical data are given in
table 3.
Equivalent dynamic radial load
Equivalent dynamic radial load can be
calculated using the following equations:
- for single row tapered roller bearings:
Pr=Fr, kN, when Fa/Fr ≤ e
Pr= 0,4 Fr + YFa, kN, when Fa/Fr > e
For single row tapered roller bearings, the Fa
values can be calculated using the equations
in table 4. These equations are available when
bearings are mounted so that axial clearance is in
fact zero without preloading. FrA and FrB should
always be considered as being positive, even if
they act in the opposite direction to that in the
figure.
In case of paired bearings and of double or
four row tapered roller bearings, Fa and Fr are the
loads acting upon the paired bearings or single
bearings.
The values of e, Y, Y 1 and Y 2 are given in bearing
tables.
Equivalent static radial load
Equivalent static radial load can be calculated
using the equations:
- for single row tapered roller bearings:
P0r=Fr, kN, 	when Fa/Fr ≤ 1/2 Y0
P0r= 0,5 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN, 	when Fa/Fr > 1/2 Y0
- for paired double or four row tapered roller
bearings:
P0r= Fr + Y0 Fa, kN
Fa is calculated as in case of equivalent dynamic
radial load. The values of Y0 are given in bearing
tables.
Abutment dimensions
The mounting dimensions of tapered roller
bearings are given in the bearings tables, for single
row tapered roller bearings. These dimensions
are also available for bearings with ribs and for
standardized paired bearings. These dimensions
are also available for bearings with ribs and for
standardized paired bearings. For the other
types of tapered roller bearings, the mounting
dimensions should be adapted depending on the
cross section size and mounting chamfer.

Four row taper roller
bearings
Four row tapered roller bearings are used motly
for rolling mill bearing arrengements application.
They can carry axial loads which occur in such
applications in addition to radial loads. Four-
row tapered roller bearings, because of their
design, must be installed as complete bearings
in the chocks. To enable quick roll changes to
be made they must therefore have a loose fit on
the roll necks. Loose fits have the disadvantage
that the inner rings wander on their seats under
the prevailing load conditions causing wear to
the seats which normally have a lower hardness
than the rings. To alleviate the effects of a loose
fit to some extent, i.e. to reduce wear, DAS LAGER
bearings have a helical groove in the bore and/or
lubrication grooves in the side faces of the inner
rings.
DAS LAGER have wide range of four-row
tapered roller bearings which covers not only
the conventional designs with intermediate
rings between the outer and/or inner rings (fig),
but also a new design with modified rings which
integrate the intermediate rings
Advantages of these four-row tapered
roller bearings
– simpler mounting because of fewer
components
– improved load distribution over the four
rows of rollers, leading to less wear and longer
service life
– simpler axial location on the roll necks
because of reduced inner ring width tolerances
– dimensional equivalence to conventional
four-row 	tapered 	roller 	bearings 	with
intermediate rings.
DAS LAGER four-row tapered roller bearings
are produced in the TQO (Figure1) and TQI
(Figure2) designs.
Bearings of the TQO configuration
Bearings of this design have two pairs of
tapered roller and cage assemblies, the two
rows of rollers of the pair being arranged face-
to-face.
Bearings of the TQI configuration
Bearings of the TQI design have two paired
rows of rollers arranged back-to-back (Figure2).
Their use is limited, being primarily where
high stiffness is required and considerable
tilting moments have to be accommodated.
The bearings are generally mounted with an
interference fit on the roll necks and therefore
often have a tapered bore. The bearings are
also used for the vertical rolls of universal mills;
in this case the outer rings are mounted with
an interference fit in the chocks and the inner
rings have a loose fit on their seat.

Thrust tapered roller bearings can carry very heavy
axial loads, what are intensive to shock and are stiff.
Tapered roller thrust bearings with cage are of
separable design so that the two washers and the
roller and cage thrust assembly can be mounted
separately and easily.
Thrust tapered roller beaarings can carry heavier
thrust load then thrust spherical and cylindrical
roller bearing with same envelope dimentions.
They are designed for high thrust-load capacity and
applications with increased pressures.
Mostly they are used machine tools, mill stands,
oil well swivels, plastic extruders applications.
Mostly they are used machine tools, mill stands,
oil well swivels, plastic extruders applications.
Single direction tapered roller thrust
bearings
The washers of the bearings with shaft and
housing washers having the same dimensions
(see figure1-a) both have a tapered raceway and
one retaining flange. Bearings of this design are
to be preferred where very heavy axial loads are
to be supported as, for example, in the swivels of
drilling rigs or in crane hooks. The bearings have a
cage which is centred on both washers.
Bearings of the other design (see figure 1-b)
have a shaft washer with tapered raceway and
retaining flange whilst the housing washer is
plane (flat). Therefore, bearings of this design are
able to accept minor eccentricities of the shaft
with respect to the housing bore without any
detrimental influence on bearing performance.
With the exception of a few sizes which have a
full complement of rollers, the bearings are fitted
with a roller centred cage.
Double direction thrust tapered roller
bearings
Double direction thrust tapered roller bearings
(see figure 1-c) are mainly used together with
multi-row cylindrical roller bearings in rolling
mill applications. Those bearings with a plane
shaft washer are the more popular as they are
able to accommodate slight eccentricities of the
shaft with respect to the housing bore, of the
order of the radial internal clearance of the radial
bearing with which they are used. A spacer sleeve
is arranged between the two housing washers.
This is dimensioned so that the cover screws of
the chock can be fully tightened and no special
spring adjustment of the bearing is required.

Tolerances
DAS LAGER single and double direction tapered
roller thrust bearings's the bore and outside
diameter tolerances as follow.
d 	Nominal bore diameter
Δdmp 	Deviation of the mean bore diameter
from the nominal ( Δdmp = dmp - d )
Vdp 	Bore diameter variation; difference
between the largest and smallest single
bore diameters in one plane
Si 	Thickness variation, measured from
middle of raceway to back (seat) face of
shaft washer and of housing washer,
respectively (axial runout)
Minimum Load
The minimum axial load to be applied to single
direction tapered roller thrust bearings can be
estimated using
Fam 	= A (n/1000) 2
where
Fam 	= minimum axial load [kN]
A 	= minimum load factor (see product data)
n 	= rotational speed [r/min]
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
For single direction thrust tapered roller
bearings which are subjected to purely axial
dynamic loads
P = Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
For single direction tapered roller thrust
bearings
P = Fa

Thrust spherical roller bearings
DAS LAGER spherical roller thrust bearings
contain a large number of asymmetrical barrel-
shaped rollers, inclined so steeply that the
bearing accommodates high axial loads in
addition to considerable radial loads at relatively
high rotational speeds. The spherical-shaped
raceway of the housing washer accommodates
misalignment between the shaft and housing.
Spherical roller thrust bearings are separable,
which allows the shaft washer, cage and roller
assembly to be mounted separately from the
housing washer. Due to their internal design
these bearings need to be lubricated with oil,
except under extremely low speeds where grease
lubrication is adequate. Applications for this
bearing type include column bearings for cranes,
brick machines, plansifter, cement industry, heavy
worm gears, and screw pumps.
Cage
DAS LAGER spherical roller thrust bearings
are designed and produced with steel and
brass cages. Each cage design is designated
by "J" for steel and "M" for brass cages. See the
follow picture for cage design construction.
Boundary Dimensions
Boundary dimensions of spherical roller
thrust bearings comply with standard ISO 104.
Tolerance
"Spherical roller thrust bearings are produced
in accordance to ABEC 1 or P0 tolerance class.
All of these tolerances comply with standard
ISO 492."
E 	Internal design change for enhanced load carrying capacity 	29426 EJ
J 	Pressed steel cage guided on the rolling elements 	29336 J
M 	Machined brass cage guided on the rolling elements 	29430 M
Misalignment
The spherical raceway of the bearing
housing washer enables the bearing to accept
a considerable amount of misalignment. See
the table below for approximate values of
misalignment. Please note these values are
sufficient for normal operating conditions.
Bearing Type Permissible Misalignment

Axial Equivalent Dynamic Load
Pa=Fa+1.2Fr (Fr < 0.55Fa) [kN ]
Minimum Axial Load
At high rotational speeds a roller thrust
bearing 	may 	experience 	roller 	element
sliding if a minimum load is not applied. For
calculation of minimum axial load Fa min the
following equation can be used:
Famin: minimum axial load [kN ]
Fr : radial bearing load [kN ]
Coa : axial basic static load rating [kN ]
nmax - maximum rotational speed [rpm]
M - minimum axial load factor
If the axial load applied is too small, it is
necessary to create an axial load with the use
of springs or a similar device.
If a radial load is applied simultaneously, the
following condition must also be fulfilled:
Fr < 0.55Fa
Axial Equivalent Static Load
P =Fa +2.7Fr 	(Fr < 0.55Fa) [kN ]
The static safety factor for spherical roller
thrust bearings must be so > 4.

Thrust Ball Bearings
Thrust Ball Bearings are separable axial bearings.
Thrust ball bearing are produced both single and
double direction.
Thrust ball bearings are only suitable for low to
medium operating speeds.
Thrust ball bearings can carry comparatively high
axial loads but they are not suitable for radial loads.
Thrust ball bearings are used in applications where
axial loads are too high to be supported by radial
bearings or when rigid axial guidance is required.
Single direction thrust ball bearings: (see figure
a, b and c)
DAS LAGER single direction thrust ball bearings
have one row of balls within a cage, running
between two grooved washers. The washers have
flat seating surfaces that must be completely
supported so that all of the balls can be evenly
loaded. This type can carry axial load only one
direction.
Single direction thrust ball bearings of series
511, 512, 513 and 514 have plain housing
washers, (see figure a).
For applications where some misalignment
may occur, single direction thrust ball bearings of
the series 532, 533 and 534 are also available with
sphered housing washers, figure b.
These bearings may be applied either direct to
sphered shaped bearings seats or, they may be
used together with seating washers of series U2,
U3 or U4 (see figure c).
The bearings are separable so that mounting
is simple as the washers and the ball and cage
assembly can be mounted separately.
Double direction thrust ball bearings: (see
figure d, e and f)
DAS LAGER double direction thrust ball
bearings consist of one shaft washer, two housing
washers and two ball and cage thrust assemblies.
The bearings are separable so that mounting
is simple. The various parts can be mounted
separately. The housing washers and ball and
cage thrust assemblies are identical to those of
the single direction bearings.
Double direction thrust ball bearings can
accommodate axial loads acting in both
directions and can thus serve to axially locate
a shaft in both directions. They must not be
subjected to radial load.
Double direction thrust ball bearings are also
available in both designs, with flat housing
washers (series 522, 523 and 524, see figure d)
and with sphered housing washers (series 542,
543 and 544, see figure e).
For compensation of possible aligning errors
the double direction thrust ball bearings may be
used in conjunction with Seating Washers (series
U2, U3 and U4, see figure f).

603
Misalignment
All thrust ball bearing types with flat housing
washers do not allow any misalignment.
The contacting surfaces of both shaft and
housing seats must be parallel. Misalignments
can only be accomodated by using Thrust Ball
bearings with sphered housing washers.
Cages
Thrust ball bearings are normally fitted with
pressed steel cages as standard.
For larger thrust ball bearings solid brass cages,
(suffix M), or solid steel cages, sufix F), are fitted
as standard.
Tolerances
DAS LAGER thrust ball bearings are produced
to normal class tolerance class (PN) as standard.
For applications of higher dimensional and
geometrical 	accuracy 	these 	bearings 	are
produced to precision tolerance class (e.g. P6) on
order request.
For detailed values of the tolerance classes see
chapter Bearing tolerances (see page 40).
Minimum load:
Thrust ball bearings require a certain minimum
axial load to esnsure a satisfactory operating
function.
To prevent excessive sliding friction, the
minimum axial load applied should be greater
than 4% of the axial bearing dynamic load rating
Ca.
Where such a minimum axial load is not
possible, the load must be increased by effective
measures, (i.e. preloading the bearing) using
pressure washers or springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Thrust ball bearings are pure axial bearings,
their are not able to accomodate any radial loads,
therefore:
P=Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
For thrust ball bearings:
P0=Fa
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for thrust ball
bearings
The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts
with their face sides only. The radii of bearing
corners must not touch the shoulder fillet radii of
the shaft or housing shoulders.
Therefore, the larest fillet radius (rg) must be
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of the
bearing rings (r s) as listed in the bearing tables.
Suffix Designation
A 	Internal design change for enhanced
limiting speed
FP Machined steel cage guided on the rolling
elements
MP Machined brass cage guided on the rolling
elements
P6 Higher tolerance class than normal
P5 Higher tolerance class than P6

Cylindrical Roller
Thrust Bearings
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are simple in form
and design and are produced in single row and
double row designs.The bearings in the 811 and 812
series are mainly used where thrust ball bearings
have insufficient load carrying capacity.
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are suitable for
heavy axial loads. Additionally, they are relatively
insensitive to shock load. They aren't suitable for
radial loads. They provide a very rigid bearing
assembly for high thrust loading with less space
requirement.
All thrust cylindrical roller bearings,increased
sliding friction can occur at the end of the cylindrical
rollers. In order to minimise this negative effect,
DAS LAGER cylindricall roler thrust bearings with
wider sectional widths are produced using several
short rollers in each cage pockets instead of using
individual longer rollers.
Single Direction Thrust Cylindrical Roller
Bearings: (see figure 1 a)
The bearings are of separable design; the
individual 	components 	can 	be 	mounted
separately.
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are of simple
design, they consist of a shaft washer (WS), a
housing washer (GS), and a cylindrical roller and
cage thrust assembly (K),
Double Direction Thrust Cylindrical Roller
Bearings: (see figure 1 b)
Double direction acting cylindrical roller
thrust bearings are built using a combination
of the components from single direction acting
cylindrical roller thrust bearings together with
intermediate washers ZS, (see fig 1 b).
Such intermediate washers are part of DAS
LAGER supplementary product range and are
available on request. For application designs with
space restrictions the cylindrical roller and cage
thrust assemblies may be used without washers
providing the contact faces of adjacent machine
parts are machined as bearing raceways, (e.g.
hardened and ground, etc).
The components of cylindrical roller thrust bearing
are frequently used either separately or in conjunction
with othercomponents in several applications (e.g. to
build needle roller thrust assemblies) therefore, they
are available as loose parts.
Figure 1

646
Misalignment
All cylindrical roller thrust bearing type do not
allow any misalignment.
The contacting surfaces of both shaft and
housing seats must be parallel.
Cages
Small DAS LAGER cylindrical roller thrust
bearings are fitted with shaft - centred polyamide
cages as standard. Polyamide cages are suitable
for operating temperatures up to +120ºC. Large
cylindrical roller thrust bearings are produced
with either solid brass cages (suffix M), or with
solid steel cages, (suffix F).
Tolerances
DAS LAGER cylindrical roller thrust bearings
are produced to normal class tolerance (PN) as
standard.
For applications of higher accuracy these
bearings are produced to precision tolerance
class (e.g. P6) on order request.
For detailed values of the tolerance classes see
chapter "Bearing tolerances" (see page 40).
Minimum load:
All cylindrical roller thrust bearing require
a certain minimum axial load to ensure a
satisfactory operating function.
To prevent excessive sliding friction, the
minimum axial load applied should be greater
than 5% of the axial bearing dynamic load rating
Ca.
Where such a minmum axial load is not possible
the load must be increased by effective measures,
(i.e. preloading the bearing) using pressure
washers or springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are pure axial
bearings, they are not able to accomodate any
radial loads, therefore:
P = Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
For cylindrical roller thrust bearings:
P0 = Fa
Design of adjacent machine parts
When cylindrical roller and cage thrust
assemblies are used without washers adjacent
machines parts must be designed and machined
as bearing raceways (e.g. hardened and ground
etc).
The maximum permissible axial runout of the
adjacent surfaces acting as raceway must also
meet the requirements of the respective washers.
For detailed information see chapter "Design of
bearing location", on page 45.
The bore diameters of DAS LAGER cylindrical
roller and cage thrust assemblies have
tolerances according to ISO Tolerance field (E11),
whilst the tolerance of their outer diameters lies
in the tolerance field (a13).
Cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies
require an effective guidance when operating at
higher speeds.
To avoid excessive wear, at higher speeds, the
guiding surface must be ground.
Bearing seats for cylindrical roller thrust
bearings
For the design cylindrical roller thrust bearing
seats the following of tolerance fields have
proven to be satisfactory in practice:
Tolerance field
Centred at 	Shaft 	Housing
Cylindrical roller and
cage thrust assembly h8 	H9
Shaft washer 	h6 	-
Housing washer 	- 	H7
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for cylindrical
roller thrust bearings
In case of cylindrical roller thrust bearings, an
effective support of the bearing washers over the
total width of their raceways by adjacent machine
parts is necessary.
The bearing washer must contact adjacent
parts with their side face only. The fillet radii of
bearing corners must not touch the shoulder
fillet radii of the shaft or housing shoulders.
Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of the
bearing rings (rs) as listed in the following tables.

Slewing bearings
Design
To ”slew”” means to turn without change of
place; a ”slewing”” bearing is a rotational rolling-
element bearing that typically supports a heavy
but slow- turning or slow-oscillating load.
Slewing bearings often use two rows of rolling
elements. They often use three race elements,
such as an inner ring and two outer ring ”halves””
that clamp together axially.
Slewing bearings are often made with gear
teeth integral with the inner or outer race, used
to drive the platform relative to the base.
Generally, slewing bearings are large-size
rolling bearings that can accommodate axial,
radial and moment loads acting either singly or
in combination and in any direction. They can
perform both slewing (oscillating) movements as
well as rotational movements.
Slewing bearings rings made generally of heat
treatment alloy steels 41MoCr11. To obtain an
increased strenght, the semi-finished rings are
quenched and tempered.
The rolling elements (balls or rollers) are placed
between the two rings. They are manufactured
of bearings steels and are separated by steel or
plastics (TN) distance rings.To avoid the foreign
bodies to penetrate the bearings, these are
sealed with rubber seals or, sometimes, with
labyrinth seales. Lubrication during operation is
provided by greasers either on the outer ring or
on the inner ring. Their emplacement is simply
designated by the symbol.
Slewing bearings can also be manufactured
with gear on the outer or inner ring, depending
on application. Gear material can be only
quenched and tempered or high frequency
surface hardened. The raceways of these bearings
are also high frequency surface hardened. Ready
made slewing bearings are protected against
corrosion by painting all surfaces, excepting the
gear which is coated with a thin uniform layer
of grease.Usually, these surfaces are coated with
ground.In this case, the user will paint the bearing
after mounting with the same colour as the
equipment. Slewing bearings are fastened to the
rotating assemblies by screws. For this purpose,
there are some holes provided in the rings.
Basically, a slewing bearing († fig. 1) consists
of an inner ring (a), an outer ring (b) and rolling
elements − balls (c) or cylindrical rollers − that
are separated by polyamide spacers (d). The
rings, one of which usually incorporates a gear
(e), are provided with holes (f ) to accommodate
attachment bolts. The holes may be threaded.
Generally, only the raceways in the rings (h) are
hardened and precision-ground. Integral seals
(g) made of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)
keep the lubricant in, and contaminants out of
the bearing. Slewing bearings are relubricated.
Slewing bearings through grease fittings (i) to
reduce maintenance and operating costs.
Slewing bearings are manufactured in a wide
range of constructive designs, with various
dimensions. We further mention the most usual
bearing sizes:

663
Slewing bearings can take over heavy axial
loads with megnitudes up to 10% of the axial
loads and also tilting moments.
Prefixes
If other materials than heat treatment steels
are used, the prefixes are the same as in case of
standardized bearings (see page 73).
Basic symbols
Considering the raceway form:
V 	- ball berings
X 	- crossed cylindrical roller bearings
Y 	- cylindrical roller bearings, three row
Considering gearing emplacement:
E 	- with external gear
I 	- with internal gear
EI 	- with internal and external gearing
U 	- without gearing
Considering the number of rolling elements rows:
10 	- single row
20 	- double row
30 	- three row
Suffixes
A, B, C, D - version of basic constructive designs
F 	- steels or sinterized powders distance
rings between rolling elements
TN 	- plactics distance rings between the
rolling elements
V 	- no distance rings between rolling
elements
L 	- light alloy cages of separable design
F81 	- surface hardened gearing
Designation
These bearings are differently designated, in
comparison to the internationally standardized
bearings. In case of the bearings manufatured by
DAS LAGER, the designation consists of:

Example of designation:
VI.10.1380ATNF81 Slewing ball bearing (V)
with internal gear (I) sigle
row balls (10), with ball
centers circle diameter of
1380 mm, design (A), with
plactics distance rings (TN)
between balls and surface
hardened gear (F81).
Fastening screws
The screws used for bearing fastening should
be selected from the groups of mechanical
characteristics 8.8, 10.9 or even 12.9.
Tolerance and clearance
The tolerances of slewing bearings are not
standardized. Maximum ovalness for external
gear and minimum ovalness for internal gear are
marked with colour on three neighboring teeth.
The value of ovalness depends on the bearing
size, section and heat treatment.
Slewing bearings are manufactured with radial
and axial clearance which should be according
to the values given in table 2. These clearances
are theoretical values and are determined
considering the median sizes of the component
The passing hole diameter for screws, clamping
load and tightening torque are given in table 1.
Considering the friction between nut and
screw, the nut frontal surface and its adjoint part,
the actual value of the nut tightening torque
can be approximated to 90% of the theoretical
tightening moment.
Considering that the extension of the screws
with dimensions greater than M30 cannot be well
enough controlled by the tightening torque, they
should be tightened until the value of 70% of the
material yield limit is reached.
Screw extension can be checked by means of a
device as shown in the figure below.

Transport and storing
Considering the specific features of these
bearings, their dimensions respectively which
exceed in most cases 1 meter and reach even
more than 5 meters, some special conditions
are required for transport and storing. The
main condition which have to be observed
during transport is to fasten all bearing parts so
that no clearance should exist between them.
Thus, contact imprints, which have detrimental
influence on bearing operation and its rating
life, shall be avoided. These bearings should
be transported and stored only in horizontal
position. Shocks should be avoided.
Mounting of slewing bearings
Special care should be given while mounting
these bearings.
The flatness of surface on which bearings are
to be mounted should be checked by means of
parts, which are measured before mounting.

Lubrication and maintenance
At delivery shall (if no special prescriptions
are mentioned) bearings will be lubricated with
grease U 170 Li 2, both on raceways and gear. The
first relubrication of raceways and gear should
be done immediately after mounting. Plenty
of grease should be used in order to create a
continuous layer all over the circumference and
also a grease rib under seals or labyrinth.
Grease is necessary to be uniformly distributed.
For that reason, bearing should rotate during
lubrication. The relubrication interval should be
chosen depending on the operatings conditions
as follows: for ball bearings it is generally of 100
operating hours and for roller bearings of 50
operating hours. In tropical and high moisture
environment and in case of continuous rotating
movement relubrication should be done once
in a week. Lubrication can be less frequent in
case of turning machines, e.g. road trailers,
tram bogie joints. Relubrication is absolutely
necessary before and after a long non-operating
period, especially during winter-time. Water
should be prevented from penetrating to the
raceways, while cleaning the machinery. Then it
must be greased abundantly. No further control
is necessary excepting the periodical control of
fastening screws.
Slewing bearings in applications.
Selection of bearing type
Slewing 	bearings 	are 	used 	in 	various
applications, such as motor cranes, harbour
cranes, hydraulic excavators, various rotating
platforms, 	siderurgical 	equipments, 	bogies
for metropolitan and tram cars, manipulators,
foundry equipments etc.
Beside bearing dimensions and technical data,
in this catalogue one can also find diagrams
showing the tilting moment and limit values of
static loads which are helpful when selecting the
proper bearing for certain operating conditions.
After calculating the force Fa and resultant
moment M r
, the bearing is selected so that the
intersection point of the values of resultant
force Fa and moment M r
, to be placed under the
respective curve (see the following example),
also considering the screws used for bearing
mounting on the assembly (strength class 8.8,
10.9 or 12.9).
a thickness gauge set, after the slewing bearing
has been placed on the mounting surface.
When mounting the bearing, the non-hardened
area of the raceway (the distance between
the begining and end of the high-frequency,
surface hardened area) should be considered. It
is marked by “C“ on the outside or inner surface
of both rings.
This part of bearing must be outside the
maximum loaded area. The place where the pitch
diameter of gear has maximum ovalness, in case
of external gear and minimum ovalness, in case
of internal gear, which are marked with paint
on three neighboring teeth should be mounted
near the differential-drive pinion. The permissible
values of flatness deviations depending on
bearing size and type are given in table 5.
If these values cannot be obtained either from
the manufacturing point of view or from the
economical one, fluid plastics are allowed to be
used, as they bind by cooling and compensate for
flatness deviations.
After a suitable bearing placing the fastening
screws should be tightened until the above
mentioned values of force and moment are
following the succession shown below (see table
1). A dynamometrical wrench can be used for
tightening.

Example
It is necessary to determine the type and size
of a slewing bearing used for crane, as shown in
the adjoint figure. The bearing has to support the
following forces:
F1 = 3 x 104 N 	l 1 = 45 m
F2 = 0,8 x 104 N 	l 2 = 20 m

The values resulting from the calculation of
crane load should be placed under the diagram
of the bearing which is to be selected. In this case,
the designation of one of the bearings which
can support these loads is VI.10.1380TNF81.
This bearing can be used with screws from the
strength class 8.8, in case 1. In case 2, when the
value of the overload coefficient is c = 1,25, the
bearing should be tightened with screws from
the class 10.9, as it results from the diagram on
page 661.

Feature
The spherical outside surface ball bearings of
DAS LAGER are deep groove ball bearings with
wide and narrow inner rings, consisting of insert
bearings (SA200, SB200, UC200, UEL200, UK200,
UCX00 and UC300) and various housing. The
type of bearing units are defined according to the
different mounting methods of the bearings to
shafts: the set-screws type, the adapter type, the
accentric locking collar type.
The DAS LAGER housing are mainly casting
housing. There are pressed steel plate housing as
well align with ease during operation and can be
conveniently mounted or dismounted.
The bearing units can operate satisfactorily
under working conditions, especially for machines
operating in dusty or muddy surroundings. Thus,
they are widely used in agricultural, construction
and transmission machineries, etc.
There are various types of sealing devices for our
products, such as synthetic rubber seals, slinger
with synthetic rubber seals and triple lip seals etc.
Sufficient lubricating grease has been put into
the bearing during manufacturing, which can
act as lubricating as well as rust proof. No more
grease is needed to put in during the lubricating
period when the bearings operate under normal
conditions. Lubricating grease can be added from
the fittings when the relubricate bearings operate
under hard conditions.
The outer ring of the bearing, has spherical
outside surface which can be fitted to the
concave spherical surface of the housing, and
the fit between them can be clearance fit or
interference fit according to different conditions.
This 	combination 	provides 	self-alignment
between the self-contained bearing and the
housing, and compensates for a certain alignment
errors or flexing of the shaft when the bearing is
in operation. This definitely increases the bearing
service life.
Pillow blocks
Lubrication
The Spherical Outside Surface Ball Bearings of
DAS LAGER generally use CG-2 rust proof lithium
based lubricating grease, with physical chemical
properties shown in the following table 1. Grease
iss filled in the spherical outside surface ball
bearings during manufacturing.

The bearings usually operate below the
temperature of 120ºC (the measuring temperature
of the outer rings is 100ºC). Grease life reduction
has to be taken into account when the bearing
continues to operate at a temperature should not
be lower than -30ºC.
The permissible speed of rotation is connected
with the fit between shaft and bearing. It is
reconnected with the fit between shaft and
bearing. It is recommended that, under normal
operating conditions, the fit between the bearing
and the shaft is h7. Looser fit allowing lower speed
is recommended when heavier load is applied.

Radial internal clearance of
bearings
The radial internal clearance of the bearing for
the unit is the same as the value of ISO 5753, the
internal radial clearance for the spherical outside
The load applied to the bearing operating under
static or slow oscillating and rotating (n<10r/min)
condition is defined as dynamic load.
The load capacity of the bearing is expressed by
the basic dynamic load rating which is shown in
the spherical outside surface ball bearing’s table.
Bearing Size selection
The bearing size is usually selected according
to the required life and reliability under a
specific type of load charged on the spherical
outside surface ball bearing
surface ball bearing is usually greater than that
for the same size of deep groove ball bearing.
The clearance for the cylindrical bore bearing
is shown in table 15, while the clearance for the
tapered bore bearing is shown in table 16.

Under normal mounting, lubricating and
maintaining conditions, the operating bearing
will have fatigue flaking due to the repeating
action of variable load charged on the contact
area between the rings and rolling elements.
Generally, the fatigue flaking is the cause of
normal damage of rolling bearings. Therefore, the
usual bearing life refers to the bearing fatigue life.
The life of group of apparently identical bearings
operating under a considerable dispersion. For
this reason, the bearing life is closely connected
with the damaging probability or the reliability
requirement.
The radial rating load of ball bearing with 90%
reliability and 500 hours minimum life is shown
in figure 7.
Life: 	The life of a rolling bearing is
defined as the total number of
revolution which the bearing is
capable of enduring before the
first evidence of fatigue flaking
develops on any one rings or
rolling elements.
Reliability: 	The reliability is the percentage
of the bearings of a group of
apparently identical bearings
operating 	under 	identical
conditions which can expect
to attain or exceed a certain
defined 	life. 	The 	reliability
of individual bearings is the
probability of the bearing to
attain or exceed a defined life.
Basic rating life: For a group of apparently
identical 	rolling 	bearings
operating 	under 	identical
conditions, the basic rating life
is defined as the total number
of revolutions that 90% of the
bearings can be expected to
complete or exceed.
Basic rating life
The fatigue rating life of spherical outside surface
ball bearings is calculated by the following
formula:
L P
C , or P
C 	L	10
3
101/3
	= 	=	` j
where:
L10 - basic rating life, 10 6r
P 	- basic dynamic load rating, N
N 	- equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
The basic dynamic load rating C is a hypothetical
constant load with a fixed direction under which
the bearing can attain a basic life of one milion
revolutions theoretically. For radial bearings, the
load refers to the radial load.
The equivalent dynamic bearing load P is a
constant load with a fixed direction under which
the bearing life is identical to that of the bearing
operating under actual load.
For a bearing operating with a constant rotation
speed, the basic rating life can be expressed in
terms of operating hours:

where:
L10h - basic rating life, h
n 	- bearing operating speed of rotation, r/min
For easier calculation, 500 hours as base of
rating life is taken, and the speed factor f n and the
life factor f h is introduced.

In this, the formula is simplified to:

The values of f h and f n can be found in figure
7 by referring to the operation speed n and
the anticipated bearing service life L10h. Then,
with the radial load (or the equivalent dynamic
bearing load), the basic dynamic load rating can
be determined according to the spherical outside
surface ball bearing’s table. If the bearing operate
under indeterminate loads and rotaion speed,
the following formula should be applied when
calculating the bearing life:
P N

where:
Pm - mean equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
P 	- equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
N 	- total revolution numbers with one load

715
Anticipated bearing service life
When 	selecting 	a 	bearing, 	one 	should
usually predetermine an appropriate service
life according to the relevant machine type,
operating condition and reliability requirement.
Generally the anticipated bearing service life can
be determined by refering to the maintenance
period of a machine.
Calculating method of equivalent dynamic
bearing load P.
The basic equivalent dynamic bearing load
is determined under a hypothetical condition.
When calculating the bearing life, the actual load
has to be converted to dynamic bearing load
which is in conformity with the load condition
determining the dynamic load rating. General
equation for calculating the equivalent dynamic
bearing load:
P = XFr + YFa,
where:
P 	- equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
Fr - actual radial load, N
Fa - actual axial load, N
X 	- radial factor
Y 	- thrust factor
The values of X and Y are determined by the
ratio between the applied axial load Fa and the
basic static load rating C0. The axial load which
the spherical outside surface ball bearing can
carry is determined by the mounting method of
the bearing on the shaft.
For bearing of set-screw Locking 	type or
eccentric Locking collar type, if flexible shafts are
applied and the set-screws are tightened enough,
the axial load Fa which the bearings can carry not
surpass 20% of the radial load Fr.
For bearing of adapter sleeve Locking type, if
the nut is properly tightened, the axial load Fa
can be maximally 15% to 20% of the radial load.
The value of radial and thrust factors X and Y
for spherical outside surface ball bearings can be
obtained from the following Table 17.
When twist load is applied to the bearing, the
equivalent dynamic bearing load is calculated by
the following equation:
Pm = fmP
where:
Pm - equivalent dynamic bearing load when
considering twist load
fm - twist load factor, which is defined as
follows:
- when the twist load is small: fm = 1,5
- when the twist load is big: fm = 2
Example of bearing size selection
When shocking load is applied to the bearing,
the equivalent dynamic bearing load can be
calculated by the following equation:
Pd = fdP
where:
Pd - equivalent dynamic bearing load when
considerating shocking load
fd - shocking load factor, which is defined as
follows:
- when no shocking load or mirror shocking
load is applied: fd = 1-1,2
- when adequate shocking load is applied:
fd = 1,2 - 1,8
How to select the size of bearing: one spherical
outside surface ball bearings is to operate at a
rotation speed of 1000r/min under only a radial
load of Fr = 3000 N, with a basic rating life of a
least 20,000 hours.
Select the bearing size
From the required rotation speed it can be
found that: f n = 0,322 (figure 7 shows about 0,32,
refer to page 689).
From the required basic rating life (anticipated
service life), it can be found that:
f h = 3,42 (figure 7 shows about 3,4, refer to page
689).
Under only radial load, i.e.
P = Fr = 3000 N
Therefore,
C n
h P 0,322
3,42 31,863 N	= 	= 	=
#
#
A simplified way to calculate the bearing life can
be applied by using figure 8.

By connecting n and the required basic rating
life L10h with a straight line, it can be found that
C/P value is 10,6.
As is know, P = Fr = 3000 N, thus the required
basic dynamic load rating is:
C = 3000 x 10,6 = 31,800, N
In this way, we can select the shperical outside
surface ball bearings inside this catalogue (refer
to pages 148-160).
Adjusted rating life equation
The basic rating life L10 calculated with
bearing life calculation formula can be applied
to calculate the rating life of bearings made
of ordinary bearing steel (i.e. bearing life with
reliability of 90%)
Due to more and more of machinery products
demanding higher reliability and better quality
steel (ISO 281/1-1977), an adjusted rating life
calculation equation is suggested. i.e.
Ln = a1 a2 a3 L10
For spherical outside surface ball bearing:
Ln = a1 a2 a3 (C/P)3
where:
Ln - under specified material and lubricating
conditions, bearing life with (100-n)% no
breaking probability (i.e. reability).
a1 - life adjustment factor for reability (table
18)
a2 - life adjustment factor materials (table 19)
a3 - life adjustment factor for operating
conditions (table 20)

Selection of shaft
The shaft on which bearing units are mounted
shall be free from band and flexure.
For the units with cylindrical bore (with set-
screws or eccentric locking collar) clearance fit
is usually adopted for mounting the units on
the shaft, and shaft tolerances in table 21 are
recommended for such loose fit, but for high
speed or highly accurate operation or such
application which is accompanied by heavy shock
loads, interference fit is to be adopted. Table 22
shows recommended shaft with inerference fit,
the eccentric locking collar may omitted.
Tapered bore bearings permit wider tolerances
of the shaft since they are locked to the shaft by
means of adapted sleeves.
Recommended shaft tolerances for tapered
bore bearings listed in table 23.

Bearings units with adapter sleeve
Bearing unit with adapter sleeve permits wider
shaft tolerance and can be used in applications
where vibrations and shocks are heavly.
Mounting processes of these units as follows:
First, the sleeve is instaled to an arbitrary
position. After the shark proof washer is inserted,
the nut is tightened.
The proper nut tightening condition can be
obtained if it is tightened enough by hand and
then rotated by 2/5 to 3/5 revolution with a
spanner.
After tightening the nut, bend the shark proof
washer within the slot. Otherwise, the nut may be
loosened and creep may be caused between the
shaft and sleeve. It is necessary the nut can not be
tightened too much.
Bearings units with eccentric locking collar
The eccentric part of the collar mates with the
inner ring of the bearing which is made eccentric
with the collar. When locked to the shaft by hand
in direction of the shaft rotation, the eccentric
locking collar tightens automatically to the shaft
by force of working radial load. Then, lock the set-
srews provided on the collar to fix the eccentric
collar to the shaft. At the shaft rotation force or
load is not charged on the set-screws directly, it
will not loosen during operation.
Fig. 9
Mounting of bearing units on shaft
The bearing units can be easy installed in
principle at any place. However, in order to have a
long service life, it is desirable that the mounting
base if flat and rigid.
In case of either the vibration is caused to the
bearing, the alternating movement takes place,
the load applied to the bearing is large, or the
shaft rotation speed is rapid, it is desired to
provide with the filed seat or concave section
at the part where the set-screws contact with
the shaft. If large thrust load is charged, it is
recommended that joggling tightened with nuts
be used to install the bearing most effectively to
the shaft: as shown in figure 9.
