T profile
ELA-flex SD ELA-flex SDTM  timing belts are manufactured with truly endless high tensile steel
tension cords and high wear resistant
polyurethane body.
Having no splice or welding, the belts have
no weak cross section.
They are therefore ideal for power transmission applications and high load conveying
transmissions. 
The unique high tech manufacturing
process designed by our  technicians
allows the production of every belt length,
tooth by tooth from the minimum of 1500
mm to a maximum of 22000 mm to enable
the highest flexibility for the application.

special Belts
Elatech® EFT
EFT is ELATECH®'s mechanical profile application system
specially designed for attaching cleats that cannot be
welded onto polyurethane timing belts.
It is offered in zinc-coated or stainless steel teeth with
either our embedded tooth or total tooth design.  The total
tooth design replaces the entire tooth of the belt and has
two securing threaded holes.  The embedded tooth design
eliminates metal-to-metal contact, making this a more quiet
solution.
Elatech® EMF  
ELATECH® EMF - Mechanical Fastening System allows in
many conveying applications cost savings associated with
being able to design equipment around the installation
principle of EMF.


Rubber and Tecnogum
Several varieties of cleats can be attached on ELATECH®
polyurethane belts for conveying, handling and positioning
applications. Belts can be perforated, ground on tooth or
back side to optimize special applications.
Cleats and Mechanical machining
Many different rubber backings in both synthetic and natural
rubber are available. Due to the  high friction coefficient and
high temperature resistance of rubber, these backings are
used in many different conveying applications: paper
industry, ceramic industry, wood processing industry, glass
industry, labelling and packaging machines.
Polyurethane Foam
Polyurethane foams are easily compressible according to the
cellular structure of the material. Due to this property,
common applications are: labelling equipment, light and/or
fragile materials conveying, glass and paper industry,
vacuum conveyors.
Polyamide Fabric 
The special polyamide fabric backings allow a reduction of
the friction coefficient and when applied on teeth, decrease
noise in high speed drives. They are very useful in applications
with sliding surfaces or product accumulation.
Polyurethane Film  
Polyurethane films of different thickness and different shore
hardness, when applied on ELATECH® belts, are an ideal
solution in many conveying applications in the wood
processing, ceramic and glass industry. 
On request it is possible to supply FDA approved polyurethane
backings.
PVC 
PVC has a high coefficient of friction and provides good
resistance to acids. Due to its versatility, it is used in many
applications in the paper, glass, ceramic industry, labelling
and packing equipment. FDA quality material is suitable for
application in food industry processes.
