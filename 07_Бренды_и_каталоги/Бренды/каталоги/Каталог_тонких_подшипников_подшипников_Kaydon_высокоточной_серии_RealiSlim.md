Reali-Slim… for compact, lightweight
designs of the future
Many years ago, Kaydon engineers trying to help designers fit
assemblies into smaller spaces had an idea: what if the bear-
ing cross-section didn’t increase as the bore size got bigger?
This led them to develop new bearings with a cross-section
that remained constant: Reali-Slim thin section bearings.
Reali-Slim bearings produce larger ratios of diameter to
radial section, which lead to space and weight savings of up to
85 percent. Such savings typically have a ripple effect, and
have been known to eliminate enough material and/or com-
ponents to reduce system cost by 40 percent.
Despite their slim profile, Reali-Slim bearings have enough
load capacity to handle a wide range of applications. A few
appear here; for more, please download our Applications

When Kaydon introduced it in 1994, Reali-Design software
quickly became the go-to program for anyone thinking about
specifying thin section bearings This innovative program has
saved engineers countless hours by doing complex power
transmission computations for them
Reali-Design and Reali-Design MM software (for Reali-Slim
inch and metric bearings, respectively), can:
• save hours of tedious computations
• reduce bearing selection time to seconds
• accurately compute essential life and load analyses
• determine safe operating speeds
• calculate load deflections
These programs (PC System requirements: Windows® 95 or
later; 50 MB of free drive space) are valuable supplements to
this catalog They include a CAD-ready DXF library, training
modules, data sheet creation program, life calculations, torque
and deflection graphs, and much more

Introduction

The inch family of Reali-Slim thin section bearings includes
seven open series (Figure 1-2) and five sealed series (Figure
1-3), ranging in bore diameters from 1 000 inch to 40 000
inches Series range from 187 x 187 inch to 1 000 x 1 000 inch
in cross-section Open bearings are available from stock in
three configurations (Types A, C & X) Stock sealed bearings are
available in Types C & X only
We can provide internal fit up, lubricants, separators and other
features to meet the most demanding specifications To obtain
corrosion resistance consider using the Kaydon stainless steel
Reali-Slim or Endura-Slim series of bearings Endurakote plat-
ing provides corrosion protection equal to or better than a full
AISI 440C stainless steel bearing and can be supplied with very
quick delivery
Additional product line variants include Reali-Slim MM metric series
bearings (Figure 1-4), Ultra-Slim bearings (Figure 1-1),
Reali-Slim TT series turntable bearings, BB metric ball bearings (all
found in Section 2), bearings for Demanding Applications, and
KT thin section taper bearings (Section 6)
Within these families, you can generally choose between open
bearings for applications where bearings will not be exposed to
damaging particulates and sealed bearings for applications
where bearings need to be kept clean and well-lubricated
To support various load scenarios, Reali-Slim bearings are
available in three basic types: radial contact (Type C), angular
contact (Type A), and four-point contact (Type X)–see pages 10
and 11 for explanations of each type–and in a variety of sizes, or
series (e g , KA, KB, KC, etc )
Reali-Slim bearings are available with various separator options
to space the rolling elements uniformly and prevent contact
between them Separator types available include: continuous
ring “snap-over pocket”, continuous ring circular pocket,
formed wire, toroid, PTFE spacers, and spacer ball separators
See Section 4 for complete details
Specification control
In today’s world, product traceability is extremely important
To satisfy these requirements, requesting a “specification
control drawing” for a Reali-Slim bearing is a valuable option
to consider
A specification control drawing provides the user a concise
description of the important bearing features and parameters
for a specific bearing A specification control drawing request will
generate a unique part number for the standard Reali-Slim
bearing, including the commercially available options you have
selected This provides the customer quick and easy identifica-
tion of product in the field as well as a concise receiving and
inspection document for the factory
Reali-Slim bearings improve design efficiency
In Reali-Slim bearings, each series is based on a single
cross-section which remains constant as the bore diameter is
increased This is in sharp contrast to standard bearings in
which the cross-section increases as the bore diameter
increases The constant cross-section of a Reali-Slim bearing is
of particular value when designing a product which will be
manufactured in various sizes based on shaft diameter and
power requirements (Figure 1-5) By using the same series of
Reali-Slim bearings throughout a product line, the designer can
standardize on common components For all diameters of this
rotary table your bearing envelope stays the same

Reali-Slim bearings make
a more compact design
Additional advantages in application design made possible by
Reali-Slim bearings can be seen by referring to Figures 1-6,
1-7, and 1-8 A large bore, small cross-section Reali-Slim
bearing permits the use of a large diameter hollow shaft (Fig-
ure 1-7) in place of a smaller diameter solid shaft (Figure
1-6), king-post design Components such as air and hydraulic
lines or electrical wiring and slip rings can then be accommo-
dated within the hollow shaft, resulting in a neater, more effi-
cient design
In many applications, a single four-point contact Reali-Slim
bearing (Figure 1-8) can replace two bearings (Figures 1-6
and 1-7) compacting the design and simplifying the bearing
mounting Besides the obvious cost savings of eliminating one
bearing, this arrangement also creates space and saves weight
The use of Reali-Slim bearings also provides a stiffer structure
by using large diameter hollow tubes to replace solid shafts and
by supporting the rotating structure (table) at the periphery

Radial and axial (thrust) loads
Bearings support a shaft or housing to permit their free motion
about an axis of rotation Load can be applied to bearings in
either of two basic directions (Figure 1-9) Radial loads act at
right angles to the shaft (bearing’s axis of rotation) Axial
(thrust) acts parallel to the axis of rotation When these loads
are offset from either the bearing axis (distance St) or radial
plane (distance Sr), a resulting moment load (M) will be cre-
ated Reali-Slim bearings are available in a variety of types to
handle radial loads, axial loads and moment loads
Reali-Slim bearing types support all load scenarios
The resultant moment load (M) equation:
M = (± T) (St) + (± R) (Sr)

Reali-Slim Type C
Figure 1-10
Although the Type C bearing is designed primarily for radial load
application, it can be configured to accept some axial (thrust)
load in either direction But, if thrust is a concern, a set of angu-
lar contact bearings should be considered for the specific
application
Types of Reali-Slim bearings
Reali-Slim bearings are available in three basic configurations:
radial (Type C), angular contact (Type A), and four-point contact
(Type X)
By using these three types, the customer has a wider choice of
mounting arrangements to meet load, stiffness and accuracy
requirements in the most efficient manner
Radial contact bearing Type C
The Type C Radial contact Bearing (Figure 1-10) is a single row
radial ball bearing of conventional design It is a Conrad-type
assembly, which means that it is assembled by eccentric dis-
placement of the inner race within the outer race which permits
insertion of about half of a full complement of balls
Reali-Slim Bearing Types
A = angular
C = radial
X = four-point

Introduction

Reali-Slim bearing types support all load scenarios
Angular contact bearing (Type A)
The Type A bearing is also a conventional design It features a circu-
lar pocket separator and a 30° contact angle (see Figure 1-11)
along with approximately 67% of a full complement of balls
The chief benefit of the Type A bearing is that it provides greater
thrust capacity than a Type C or Type X bearing Because of its
counterbored outer race, a Type A bearing has unidirectional
thrust capacity Thus, this bearing should be mounted opposed
to another bearing to establish and maintain the contact angle,
and to support reversing thrust loads

Four-point contact bearing (Type X)
Standard bearing lines are most often designed to handle either
radial or axial load conditions The unique feature of the
Reali-Slim Type X four-point contact bearing line (see Figure 1-12)
is that the gothic arch geometry of the inner and outer races ena-
bles a single bearing to carry three types of loading (radial, axial
and moment) simultaneously This makes it the bearing of choice
for many applications since a single four-point contact bearing can
often replace two bearings, providing a simplified design
Type X bearings may also be furnished with an internal diame-
tral preload for those applications requiring greater stiffness or
zero free play This is accomplished by using balls that are larger
than the space provided between the raceways The balls and
raceways, therefore, have some elastic deformation in the
absence of an external load
NOTE: Kaydon does not recommend the use of two Type X
bearings on a common shaft, as it could result in objectionable
friction torque

Type A – Angular contact
Type A – Angular contact
A deep groove bearing with reduced shoulder on one
side of inner or outer race ball path Snap-over assembly per-
mits use of a one-piece circular pocket ring separator and
greater ball complement These bearings will accept radial load
and single direction thrust load and are normally used in con-
junction with another bearing of similar construction Type A
bearings require the application of thrust to establish contact
angle Stock bearings are individual units and when purchased
as such must be adjusted at installation to desired running
clearance or preload If preferred, matched sets are available
Kaydon also offers matched spacers for applications requiring
extra precision Kaydon can provide this service direct from the
factory

To realize the full benefits from anti-friction bearings, it is
important to keep them clean and well lubricated Seals and
shields, properly designed and mounted, help to accomplish
this In this catalog these terms have the following definitions:
Seal – a contacting closure between the stationary and rotating
members, for retaining lubricant within and excluding foreign
material from the bearing Seals are retained in the outer race
and make positive contact with the inner race
Shield – a closure for the same purpose as a seal but without
positive contact
A seal is more effective, but requires more turning effort
(torque), generates more heat, and as a result, has a lower
speed limit than an open or shielded bearing
The accompanying illustrations are examples by which
Reali-Slim bearings may be sealed or shielded, either integrally
or externally The lubricant and lubrication systems, torque
requirements, speed, and operating environment will influence
the choice
Integral seals and shields offer a very compact overall design
with the additional advantage of protecting the bearing before,
during and after installation
Figure 2-2 shows a double-sealed Reali-Slim bearing,
available from stock in the JU series In this case, adding shields
and seals requires an increase in the width of the bearing (see
page 2, Position 2) In the case of JA, JB, and JG double-sealed
Reali-Slim bearings, the bearing width is the same as that of
the open bearing
Shown in Figure 2-4 is a double-shielded bearing for use
where a shield will suffice or is required due to torque
limitations or speed
Where weight and space are at a premium, and a seal or shield
is required on one side only, single-sealed or single-shielded
bearings are available as custom options
Note: Sealed Reali-Slim bearings are pre-lubricated with a
general purpose grease Operating conditions (i e time,
temperature, speed, environment) may result in premature
lubrication degradation A variety of lubricants are available as
options to meet your specifications

Figure 2-5 shows a nitrile lip-type seal ring available in a variety of cross-sections compatible
with the Reali-Slim bearing series While this is a very effective seal, torque is substantial and
speeds must not exceed 1000 feet per minute if continuous
If grease lubrication is used and torque is not critical, a very effective shield is that shown in
Figure 2-6, where annular grooves are cut in the housing shoulder and clamp plate and filled
with grease
When a separate shield is required, washers made from precision flat stock are ideal, as shown in
Figure 2-7 They serve well where weight limitations are strict
Whether or not integral seals or shields are specified, bearings must be isolated from hostile
environments and debris

* 	Diametral clearance after installation theoretically can range rather widely if all contributing bearing, housing, and shaft
tolerances are at either of their extremes
Listed shaft and housing diameters are for steel supports with standard bearing diametral clearance Recommended shaft
and housing diameters can change greatly based on orientation, temperature, speed, non-standard diametral clearances,
and desired performance characteristics Contact Kaydon for design assistance when required

Introduction
Endurakote plating protects bearings from corrosion and pro-
vides substantial life improvements in hostile environments
Endurakote plating is applied over conventional bearing materi-
als such as AISI 52100 steel, and offers the benefit of corrosion
resistance normally found only in stainless steel bearings The
coating is applied to each entire bearing race ring, including the
paths, thus leaving no area exposed Other commercial chrome
or cadmium coatings normally accepted and used cannot be
applied to the path due to the rolling contact stresses Endur-
akote plating is hard chromium, electrodeposited by a proprie-
tary process which achieves a true molecular bond, and will not
flake or peel even under the high contact stresses experienced
in the bearing paths
Laboratory and field testing results have proven the benefits of
this process Severe salt spray testing has shown that bearings
with Endurakote plating withstand corrosion as well as or better
than AISI 440C stainless steel The hard, dense exterior surface
formed by the coating is extremely wear resistant and is excel-
lent in the retention of the lubricant film Conventional life test-
ing of AISI 52100 steel bearings with Endurakote plating has
shown that no life de-rating is necessary In fact, the extremely
hard surface of Endurakote plating protects the bearing from
surface generated damage which can promote premature fail-
ure Since the coating is capable of withstanding extremely high
temperatures, the bearings are limited by the bearing materials
or lubricant used
The coating used for Endurakote plating can be applied to any
type of bearing and to most bearing materials Its primary
advantage is to utilize stock materials such as AISI 52100, etc
with their economies, and convert them to wear and corrosion
resistant bearings This is particularly beneficial for larger diam-
eter bearings or where quick delivery is critical Thus, cost sav-
ings can be achieved over more exotic or specialized materials
Also, stock bearings can have Endurakote plating applied for
quick delivery
The net result is that we can offer bearings with the capacity of
conventional bearing steels and the corrosion resistance of AISI
440C stainless steel from standard AISI 52100 stock
components
Application
Endurakote plating provides corrosion resistance and is effec-
tive in increasing wear resistance in sliding surface contacts
such as the lands where the cage pilots The micro-surface
composition of Endurakote plating aids in lubricant dispersion,
enhancing base metals to the degree of reducing or eliminating
galling, seizing, and high friction, over a wide range of installa-
tions and environments
Advantages
Endurakote plating effects a buildup of less than 0002 under
normal circumstances Thus, it can often be applied to stock
bearing components which have been specially selected
Endurakote plating is compatible with most ferrous and nonfer-
rous metal, allowing maximum flexibility in selection of base
material Endurakote plating is normally a final process, and its
quality is constant with any given base metal, insuring design
reproducibility
Properties and characteristics
A Hardness
Endurakote plating, as deposited, has an equivalent hardness in
excess of 70 Rockwell “C ” When measured by conventional
micro-hardness methods, the host material will modify this
measurement to some degree
B Coefficient of friction
(Note: Measurements made at 72°F, using other materials for
comparison )

C Adhesion
Endurakote plating will not flake, crack, chip, peel or otherwise
separate from the base material under standard bend tests or
under conditions where severe heat is induced The adherence
is adequate to withstand the extremely high compressive
stresses in the contact areas of ball and roller bearings
D Effect on base
The purity of the chromium surface will not be less than 99% as
deposited A comprehensive testing program at Kaydon estab-
lished that bearings with Endurakote plating exhibited load car-
rying capacities and life expectancy equal to or better than
uncoated AISI 52100 steel bearings
E Corrosion resistance
Endurakote plating resists attack by most organic and inorganic
compounds with a pH within the range of 4 and 11, except sul-
furic and hydrochloric acids Porosity of the base metal, com-
pound concentration and exposure time to the compound
become corrosion factors, but Endurakote plating greatly
enhances the base material In severe salt spray tests as well as
tap water immersion tests, AISI 52100 steel with Endurakote
plating proved equal to fully hardened AISI 440C stainless steel
in resistance to rusting In many instances, Endurakote plating
is better for corrosion protection than cadmium plate, zinc plate,
phosphates, chromates, black oxide or normal chrome plate We
invite inquiries about this and will be pleased to arrange tests to
qualify Endurakote plating for specific environments
F Heat resistance
Reali-Slim bearings with Endurakote plating are designed to
maintain their operating characteristics over a temperature
range from -65°F to 250°F
G Surface quality
Endurakote plating conforms to the texture of the existing sur-
face Ra finish will be improved slightly down to about 8 Ra;
below 4 Ra there is little change Endurakote plating has a
matte or micro-orange peel surface with very good lubricant
retention qualities
H Food Industries
Endurakote plating is used on food processing equipment
I Load Capacity
Endurakote plating does not affect the static or dynamic load
capacity of the bearing These values can be found by looking up
the corresponding part number — starting with “K” — in the
standard Reali-Slim bearing tables
Bearing size capabilities
Endurakote plating can be applied to any Reali-Slim bearing
Restrictions
Kaydon does not recommend the use of Endurakote plating in
any low torque or torque-sensitive applications

A deep groove bearing with reduced shoulder on one side of
inner or outer race ball path Snap-over assembly permits use
of a one-piece circular pocket ring separator and greater ball
complement These bearings will accept radial load and single
direction thrust load and are normally used in conjunction with
another bearing of similar construction Type A bearings require
the application of thrust to establish contact angle Stock bear-
ings are individual units and when purchased as such must be
adjusted at installation to desired running clearance or preload

Stainless steel bearings
(Material Code S)
Kaydon stainless steel bearings
are used where high precision and
corrosion resistance are required.
In today's manufacturing environment, bearings are often
required:
• to operate in close proximity to corrosive chemicals
• to operate with lubricants which do not protect against
corrosion
• to be ready-to-use, ultra-clean bearings with no preserva-
tive on them
Because any of these requirements would disqualify the use of
standard 52100 steel material, Kaydon addressed these issues
by offering Reali-Slim thin section bearings in AISI 440C stain-
less steel This steel meets the minimum 58 HRc hardness level
and can support the same loading as does 52100 chrome steel
All bearings made of this material also utilize balls made of AISI
440C stainless steel
Stainless Steel Reali-Slim thin section bearings minimize the
surface degradation and particulate formation so common in
harsh environment applications
They are available:
• in AISI 440C stainless steel races
• with brass or non-metallic separators
• with either stainless steel or ceramic balls
• in popular sizes
• in either radial contact “C,” angular contact “A,” or four-point
contact “X” configurations
NOTE: In addition to the open Reali-Slim bearings on the fol-
lowing pages, many sealed Reali-Slim bearings are available in
stainless steel Please refer to pages 29-34 and, when order-
ing, replace the J in the part number with a W

Type A – stainless steel open Reali-Slim bearings, angular contact
1 	Capacities listed are not simultaneous For combined loading see discussion of Bearing Selection and Load Analysis Dynamic capacities are based upon 1 million
revolutions of L10 life Published capacities do not apply to hybrid series bearings P, X, and Y - contact Kaydon product engineering for values
2 	Static capacities are non-brinell limits based on rigid support from the shaft and housing
3 	ISO Radial ratings are calculated per ISO 281:1990 They are included for comparison only (refer to Page 95)
4 	“F” is the maximum shaft or housing fillet radius the bearing corners will clear
A deep groove bearing with reduced shoulder on one side of
inner or outer race ball path Snap-over assembly permits use
of a one-piece circular pocket ring separator and greater ball
complement These bearings will accept radial load and single
direction thrust load and are normally used in conjunction with
another bearing of similar construction Type A bearings require
the application of thrust to establish contact angle Stock bear-
ings are individual units and when purchased as such must be
adjusted at installation to desired running clearance or preload
If preferred, matched sets are available Kaydon also offers
matched spacers for applications requiring extra precision
Kaydon can provide this service direct from the factory

Reali-Slim MM metric series bearings
Kaydon created the thin section bearing standard of the
industry in 1954 based on inch sizes The Reali-Slim inch-
standard bearing is still the most widely used thin section
bearing in the world
However, for those applications that require metric envelope
dimensions or for dimensional interchangeability with other
products, Kaydon offers the Reali-Slim MM series of bearings
These bearings are offered:
• in cross sections of 8, 13, and 20mm
• with bore diameters ranging from 20mm to 360mm
• with many of the same options found on standard
Reali-Slim bearings
• Popular items – are marked in the product tables with the
symbol X Bearings marked as popular items are of sizes that
Kaydon produces for many customers and are usually in
stock They have a high level of availability and generally pro-
vide a cost-effective solution
The Reali-Slim MM series may also be customized for
special applications with options such as:
• ceramic balls
• special lubes
• integral seals
Consult Kaydon engineering or
your Kaydon representative for
details on customization

A deep groove bearing with reduced shoulder on one side of
inner or outer race ball path Snap-over assembly permits use
of a one-piece circular pocket ring separator and greater ball
complement These bearings will accept radial load and single
direction thrust load and are normally used in conjunction with
another bearing of similar construction Type A bearings require
the application of thrust to establish contact angle Stock bear-
ings are individual units and when purchased as such must be
adjusted at installation to desired running clearance or preload
If preferred, matched sets are available Kaydon also offers
matched spacers for applications requiring extra precision

Kaydon BB Metric Series four-point contact ball bearings are dimensionally
interchangeable with cross-roller bearings.
BB series bearings are available to match
the bores and widths of common cross-
roller bearings
When factors such as cost, availability, corrosion resistance,
tighter tolerances, torque, seal/shield options, and temperature
resistance are important in your application, it pays to consider
BB Series four-point contact metric ball bearings as an alterna-
tive to cross-roller bearings The additional design flexibility
they offer can often help you achieve your design objectives
with optimum performance and economy
Additional features not commonly available in standard cross-
roller bearings include a protective package for corrosion resist-
ance, custom sealing for extreme environments, applica-
tion-specific lubrication and temperature capability
Optimize your design options
With additional features not commonly available in standard
cross-roller bearings, BB Series bearings provide greater
design flexibility
Endurakote Plating – For applications requiring superior cor-
rosion resistance we offer our proprietary Endurakote plating
This thin, dense chrome plating gives AISI 52100 bearing mate-
rial corrosion resistance equal to or better than that of AISI
440C stainless steel Unlike many traditional chrome platings,
the extremely hard surface of Endurakote plating doesn’t peel
and flake from the bearing race under stress, so corrosion
resistance is retained and surface wear is minimized The per-
formance of Endurakote plating has been proven in critical mili-
tary, aerospace, and deep space applications
Seals/Shields – Standard industry seals are generally available
from nitrile rubber Kaydon can also provide custom seals man-
ufactured from silicone or Viton® materials for applications
where high temperature or extreme environments are likely to
be encountered
Temperature Capability – Standard cross-roller bearings have
a maximum full capacity operating temperature of only 212°F
In contrast, Kaydon bearings can operate at higher tempera-
tures due to our heat treating procedures
Lubrication Options – Kaydon offers a full range of lubricants,
allowing you to optimize bearing performance in a range of
applications with special requirements for moisture resistance,
hot or cold temperatures, vacuum, and low torque
Separators – The common roller spacer for many cross-roller
bearings is a non-metallic composite High temperature and/or
horizontal axis applications, however, require non-standard
materials or a non-standard separator design Kaydon four-
point contact ball bearings are available with separator options
to meet a wide range of applications
Internal Fitup – Kaydon can help you optimize internal fitup of
our BB Series four-point contact ball bearings to provide the
desired operating performance Pre-loaded bearings are rec-
ommended for greater stiffness, and diametral clearance is rec-
ommended for lower torque applications

Ultra-Slim thin section bearings
Ideal for applications in robotics, inspection equipment,
satellites, cameras… anywhere precise positioning and
lightweight designs are critical
At just 2 5 mm wide, Ultra-Slim bearings are available in bore
sizes ranging from 35 mm to 170 mm for an array of applica-
tions Their compact profile allows you to use Ultra-Slim bear-
ings in many highly confined spaces
Precision-engineered Ultra-Slim bearings are made of stain-
less steel for corrosion resistance They are available in angular
contact (Type A), radial contact (Type C), and four-point contact
(Type X) styles Torque figures shown are for single bearings
with standard internal fit-up, standard lubricant at room tem-
perature, and under 5 pounds thrust load (See selection charts
on the next page )
Note that Ultra-Slim bearings are not designed to be preloaded
and are not recommended for continuous rotation applications,
as the cross-section cannot accommodate a separator
Hybrid bearings with ceramic balls are available upon request
These are used often when lubrication is marginal or when
lower wear generation and/or lower torque levels are required

How to identify Ultra-Slim bearings using our part number code
Ultra-Slim bearings are unique in that their extremely thin
cross section enables them to provide great size and weight
reductions for light to medium duty applications with slow or
intermittent rotation
Given the fact that these bearings will most likely be used in
lightly loaded applications where saving weight and space are
the main objective, the loading values shown assume that the
shaft and housing will also be of light construction This will
allow for greater bearing ring movement under load than tradi-
tional heavy section bearings Thus the loading limits for capac-
ity are not based on ABMA standards
Depending on the support provided by the shaft and housing,
this movement can create increased stress levels within the
bearing Distortion of the shaft and housing under load will
transfer to the bearing, causing increased stress levels which
could lead to premature failure and/or erratic torque conditions
The impact of non-uniform shaft and housing distortions is best
found by testing If problems are experienced, increased rigidity
of the shaft and housing may be necessary If the shaft and
housing are of sufficient rigidity, it may be possible for the bear-
ings to support greater loads than the loading limits provided

Precision tolerances & recommended fits
for Ultra-Slim bearings
Kaydon Class 1 for A, C, X Type bearings
a Dynamic radial capacities are included for life calculation purposes These are based on the assumption that the shaft and housing have adequate strength to support the
loads without causing excessive distortion of the bearing rings
b Static radial capacities are based on maximum allowable contact stresses Adequate support of the races is assumed to help assure uniform ball support
c Higher loading limits may be achieved with sufficiently rigid supports that will better restrict the movement of the bearing races under load
d Corner size is the maximum shaft or housing fillet radius that the bearing corners will clear

To save weight, reduce product envelope sizes and increase
design flexibility – without compromising bearing performance
and life – customers told us they’d welcome a more compact
turntable bearing design
We responded by designing the first small-scale, thin section
turntable bearings, for such demanding applications as robot-
ics, radar antennae, and factory positioning and inspection
tables… the Reali-Slim TT Series The advantages of this series
vs conventional turntable bearings include:
Significantly smaller size for greater design versatility and
reduced weight;
Greater accuracy – extended radial bearing section increases
rigidity, with optional preload or clearances to meet application
torque or deflection requirements;
Easier to use – fast installation and changeout;
Custom configurations to meet your application’s specific needs
– many drive options, gearing/timing belt, mounting hole types;
and
Designed to withstand harsh operating environments –
AISI-440C steel races, steel reinforced seals
Figure 2-10
Only from Kaydon: Reali-Slim TT Series small-scale,
thin section turntable bearings
Bearings are most often designed to handle either radial or
axial load conditions But the Reali-Slim TT Series four-point
contact bearings have a unique inner and outer race geometry
that enables a single bearing to carry three types of loading
(radial, axial and moment) simultaneously This makes it the
bearing of choice for many applications since a single four-point
contact bearing can often replace two bearings, providing a
simplified design
Reali-Slim TT Series bearings may also be furnished with an
internal diametral preload for those applications requiring
greater stiffness or zero free play This is accomplished by using
balls that are larger than the space provided in the raceways
The balls and raceways, therefore, have some elastic deforma-
tion in the absence of an external load

Bearing selection
Type C – Radial contact
The Type C Radial Contact ball bearing is a single-row radial ball
bearing with extra deep ball grooves in both rings (groove depth
= 25% of ball diameter) Normally this bearing is assembled by
eccentric displacement of the inner race within the outer race
which permits insertion of about half of a full complement of
balls After insertion of the balls, the races are positioned
concentrically and the balls are spaced about the entire
circumference for assembly of the separator This method of
assembly is commonly termed “Conrad Assembly ”
An alternate method of assembly is to insert balls through a
“filling slot” made by notching the raceway shoulder of one or
both races This method permits assembly with up to a full
complement of balls for additional load capacity, however, there
are limitations on the operating conditions and these are dis-
cussed under Separator Types
Type C bearings perform best with a small amount of clearance
between the balls and races (diametral clearance) Standard
bearings are supplied with clearances for:
• Interference fitting between bearing races and mounting
members;
• Differential thermal expansion or contraction of steel races;
• Misalignment between shaft and housing and other factors
may require the clearance to be adjusted accordingly
The Type C radial contact bearing is designed to have ball to race
contact in the plane of the ball centers when pure radial load is
applied and thrust forces are absent Necessary diametral
clearance may be increased or decreased to meet operating
conditions
While designed primarily for radial load application, the Type C
bearing, without a filling slot, will accept some axial (thrust) load
in either direction Its ability to resist axial load, however, is
dependent upon the amount of clearance in the bearing after
installation It is this clearance which allows the balls, under
axial load, to contact the races at an angle, thereby offering
resistance to such load In the case of the bearing with a filling
slot, the notches interrupt the ball contact paths under axial
load, minimizing the dynamic thrust capability Where axial load
is present, therefore, rotation of the filling slot bearing must be
restricted
By increasing the diametral clearance beyond the standard
amount, the Type C bearing can have a greater angle of contact
under axial load, and thus greater thrust capacity In this case, it
is proper to adjust the bearing against another bearing of simi-
lar construction to reduce axial movement under reversing
thrust forces Used in this manner, the bearing is essentially an
angular contact rather than a radial contact bearing
Type A – Angular contact
Type A Angular Contact ball bearings differ from Type C bearings
in that Type A bearings have sufficient diametral clearance to
produce a substantial angle of contact for resistance to axial
load This contact angle is 30° in the standard bearing As in the
Type C bearing, extra deep ball grooves are used (25% of ball
diameter)
The distinguishing feature of the Type A bearing lies in the
method of assembly One ring, usually the outer, is coun-
ter-bored to reduce one shoulder of the raceway to the extent
that with the assistance of a temperature differential between

Bearing selection
the two rings, the outer ring can be installed over the inner race,
ball, and separator assembly This provides a non-separable
bearing capable of carrying greater radial loads while resisting a
substantial axial force in one direction With an axial force
applied, the faces of the inner and outer rings are approximately
flush to minimize preload adjustments
This assembly method permits the use of a greater complement
of balls than is possible in the Type C bearing without filling
slots, and together with the sizable contact angle, gives the Type
A bearing its greater thrust capacity
Because of its unidirectional thrust capability, this bearing
should be mounted opposed to another bearing such that an
axial force is present to establish and maintain the contact angle
and to minimize axial movement under reversing thrust loads
Back-to-back mounting
Figure 3-1
Shim for adjustment
Typical mountings of Type A bearings are shown in Figures 3-1
and 3-2 In Figure 3-1, the bearings are mounted with the
lines of contact converging outside of the bearings This is com-
monly called a “back-to-back” mounting In this figure, the
bearings are adjustable through the inner races by use of shims
under the inner race clamping ring Sufficient shim thickness is
provided initially to allow axial movement of the shaft relative to
the housing The total axial movement can then be measured
and the shim thickness reduced by the amount of movement
plus any additional amount desired for preload When two bear-
ings are opposed to each other to the extent that all internal
clearance is removed and elastic deformation occurs between
the balls and raceways, the bearings are said to be “preloaded ”
Face-to-face mounting
Figure 3-2
In Figure 3-2, the bearings are mounted “face-to-face” with
the contact lines converging inward Spacers are used between
both the inner and outer races and adjustment is possible by
varying the length of one spacer relative to the other Normally,
however, the spacers are equal in length and the bearings are
furnished as a matched pair with a predetermined internal fit If
the outer race spacer were removed from this assembly, the
bearings could be adjusted by use of shims under the outer race
clamping ring

Duplexed bearings
Type A bearings are furnished as matched sets – available
direct from the factory – when they are to be mounted adjacent
or with equal length inner and outer race spacers When
required, Kaydon can supply assemblies with matched ground
spacers The arrangements shown in Figures 3-3, 3-4, and
3-5 are known as duplexed bearings – back-to-back, face-to-
face, and tandem, respectively Sets of three, four or more
bearings can also be matched where conditions require addi-
tional capacity and there is insufficient space radially for larger
bearings
The bearings in these sets are matched within close limits for
size of bore and outside diameter Each set is marked with a “V”
across the bores and outside diameters at the high point of
radial runout and indicate the proper orientation of the races at
installation (Figure 3-5)
The pairs shown in Figures 3-3 and 3-4 are normally fur-
nished with the race faces ground to provide preload when
installed To accomplish this, a gap is provided between the
inner races of the pair in Figure 3-3 and between the outer
races of the pair in Figure 3-4 When the bearings are installed
and clamped axially, the gap is closed, producing a preload on
the bearings
Back-to-back arrangement of Figures 3-1 and 3-3 offers
greater rigidity under moment loading and should be used
when the space between single bearings is small or when a sin-
gle pair of adjacent bearings is employed
Face-to-face arrangement is more tolerant of misalignment
between the shaft and housing and should be considered when
there are multiple pairs of bearings along an axis When single
bearings are mounted face-to-face, they must be spaced suffi-
ciently to provide resistance to moment load If required, a face-
to-face pair can be mounted in conjunction with another bear-

ing in a “fixed-float” arrangement with the pair in the fixed
position (Also see Section 5, Mounting )
Tandem bearing sets have single direction thrust capacity and
must be mounted opposed to another bearing or set
When applying catalog load ratings to matched sets, the total
radial capacity is considered equal to the single bearing radial
rating multiplied by N0 7, where N is the number of bearings in
the set The thrust capacity in each direction is considered equal
to the single bearing thrust rating multiplied by N0 7, where N is
the number of bearings resisting thrust in that direction
Unless specifically requested, the outboard faces of bearing sets
are not controlled If outboard face flushness is required for
preload purposes, universally ground bearings should be con-
sidered On universally ground bearings, both inboard and out-
board faces are matched under a specified gage load to control
preload and allow for mounting orientation flexibility
Type X – Four point contact
The Type X Four-Point Contact ball bearing is distinguished
from Types A and C by the geometry of its ball grooves In Type
C, the centers of the radii both lie in the plane of the ball centers
(Figure 3-6) In Type A with the races and balls in angular con-
tact, the centers of the groove radii are offset equal amounts on
either side of the plane of the ball centers (Figure 3-7) In the
Type X bearing the groove in each race has two radii whose
centers are offset from the plane of the ball centers (Figure
3-8) The latter construction gives the Type X bearing its unique
“Gothic Arch” configuration, making possible four contact points
between a ball and the raceways
Type X bearings are assembled by the methods described in
Type C bearings, either Conrad or filling slot With a filling slot,
both the dynamic radial and thrust capabilities are impaired by
the interruption of the ball contact path, and speed of rotation
must be limited
The depth of groove in the Type X bearing is the same as in
Types A and C (25% of ball diameter) The deep groove combined
with the four-point contact geometry enables this bearing to
resist a combination of radial, thrust, and moment loading The
manner in which the bearing accomplishes this is similar to that
of a pair of Type A bearings duplexed back-to-back

Referring to Figure 3-9, an axial force applied to the inner race
from right to left is passed from the race to the ball at point B It
is then transmitted through the ball to point D where it passes
into the outer race and support structure The line of action BD
forms a nominal 30° angle with the radial centerline of the
bearing Because of the elastic deformation of the ball and the
race grooves along the load-transmission line, the ball load is
relieved at points A and C, permitting smooth rotation around
an axis perpendicular to line BD With an axial force applied to
the inner race from left to right, a similar transmission of load
occurs between points C and A

Moment or overturning load
A moment or overturning load is similar to two thrust loads act-
ing in opposite directions at diametrically opposite sides of the
bearing With a moment load, the loading on one side of the
bearing will pass from point B to D, relieving points A and C
Directly across the bearing, the load passes from point C to
point A, relieving points B and D
A radial load is resisted equally across the lines of contact CA
and BD Under combined loading the resistance is along both
lines of contact with the magnitude of each reaction dependent
upon the relationship of the individual loads
By its ability to resist radial, thrust, and moment loads in any
combination, the Type X bearing is often able to replace two
bearings –a pair of angular contact ball bearings, a pair of
tapered roller bearings, or a combination of thrust and radial
bearings, either ball or roller
As in the case of the Type C bearing, Type X bearings are nor-
mally supplied with diametral clearance The latter bearing,
however, is not dependent upon this clearance for its nominal
contact angle and thrust capacity On the contrary, where thrust
or moment loading is considerable, the clearance should be
minimized to prevent the angle of contact from becoming
excessive For many applications requiring greater stiffness,
Type X bearings are furnished with an internal preload This is
accomplished by using balls larger in diameter than the space
provided between the raceways The balls and raceways in this
case have some elastic deformation without the presence of
external load
NOTE: Type X Bearings are designed to be used singularly Use
of two Type X bearings on a common shaft could result in objec-
tionable friction torque

Capacity, life, and load analysis of Reali-Slim ball bearings
ABMA 9:1990/ISO 281:1990
Many bearing manufacturers calculate dynamic radial capacity
in accordance with the formulas in ABMA Standard 9 and ISO
281-1990 However, in Kaydon’s judgment these equations are
overly optimistic because they assume certain design details
that are not valid for thin section bearings
The capacities of Kaydon bearings as calculated using these
equations are included for comparison purposes only Alongside
these ABMA 9:1990/ISO 281:1990 capacities, readers will find
Kaydon Radial Capacities, which are calculated using more real-
istic assumptions based on actual design details and validated
by decades of fatigue life testing Please see the Kaydon white
paper “Not All Thin Section Bearings Are Created Equal,”
available at our website:
http://www kaydonbearings com/white_papers_1B htm
Increased capacity
The values in Kaydon radial capacities are consistent with both
ABMA Std 9 and ISO 281 calculations, when the proper
assumptions are considered The increased capacities apply to
bearings with standard internal clearance The new values
assume that a certain amount of clearance is left in the bearing
after installation
The biggest increase is in the radial capacity of four-point con-
tact (Type X) bearings Under the old rating system, four-point
contact bearings were given the same capacity as radial (Type
C) bearings However, in this type of bearing the ball loads are
distributed over two lines of contact on each race This gives
lower contact stress and longer life, as demonstrated by Kaydon
testing
Life
The dynamic capacity values shown in this catalog are based on
actual data from fatigue life testing The capacities are based on
1,000,000 revolutions L10 fatigue life This is the industry stand-
ard that was established for ease of calculation It is not advisa-
ble to apply loads equal to the dynamic capacities in an actual
application Continuous rotation under these conditions would
not normally yield acceptable life
L 10 fatigue life is that life which 90% of a representative group of
identical bearings can be expected to achieve or exceed before
evidence of subsurface material fatigue appears The life of the
remaining 10% is unpredictable The life which 50% of the bear-
ings may be expected to achieve or exceed is approximately 5
times the L10 life This is known as the L50 or median life
There is no significant difference between the dynamic capacity
for inner race rotation versus outer race rotation This is due to
the relatively small ratio of ball diameter to pitch diameter in
Reali-Slim bearings
Static load capacities are shown in this catalog However, the
actual static load a Reali-Slim bearing can withstand is depend-
ent upon the amount of support provided by the shaft and
housing
The published capacity numbers allow the user to quickly esti-
mate the bearing L10 life for a one-dimensional load case The
life can be estimated using one of the following equations:
L10 	• 1,000,000 revolutions
	C
P

( )
Where: L 10 = life in revolutions
C = Kaydon dynamic rating
P = Applied load (effective)
or
For determining the life in hours at a given speed of rotation the
above formula can be changed to read:
Lh 	hours

Where: L h = L 10 life in hours
S = Speed in RPM
For multiple load cases or non-standard internal fits, the analysis
becomes more complicated Contact Kaydon Engineering for these
cases or consult Reali-Design software available on our website:
www kaydonbearings com
It should be noted that the capacities published in this catalog are
best used for comparison purposes The actual value of a life
calculation is only valid for an individual load case and the internal
fitup for which the number was derived Since it is very rare to have
a truly radial or axial or moment load, these are not normally used
for a life calculation
Load analysis
Previous versions of this catalog have discussed applying the loads
from a free body diagram to a bearing system and solving for each
of four reactions As there are generally three equations (one for
radial, one for axial, one for moment loads) and four unknowns,
one of the reactions has been assumed to be zero Once the
remaining reactions are resolved, the life of the bearing can be
determined

• It suggested very low bearing life for systems with predomi-
nantly axial loads
• Internal bearing fitup could not be included in the life
calculation
• All loading was assumed to be distributed around the bearing
as though it were a pure radial load… regardless of its origin
Modern computers and software allow for a more complicated
and accurate method of determining life Illustrated here are the
results of this process The actual loads are applied to the bear-
ing and the resultant load on each and every ball in that bearing
is determined From this data, the static safety factor and
dynamic L10 life can be determined
To better understand this, the following should be considered:
Primary radial loading
• Larger clearances will have fewer balls carrying the loads,
resulting in lower dynamic lives
• Larger preloads may overload the bearing before the loads
are applied
Primary axial and moment loading
• Larger clearances will permit a higher contact angle than the
ball has with the raceway, and thus better support the applied
loading
• However, the ball-to-raceway contact area may spill over the
edge of the race, causing other problems
• Larger preloads may again overload the bearing before the
loads are applied
The method for calculating either a static safety factor or
dynamic life requires a computer to determine the individual
ball loads throughout the bearing When these have been cal-
culated, the maximum loaded ball is used to determine a maxi-
mum stress level and thus a static safety factor All of the ball
loads are used in a weighted analysis to determine the dynamic
L10 life
Since these calculations require a computer, the mathematics
required are not shown here To complete such an analysis, uti-
lize the Kaydon supplied software – Reali-Design or Reali-De-
sign MM – available at www kaydonbearings com
To better understand these principles, graphical representa-
tions of ball distribution around each of three common bearing
types are shown in Figures 3-10 through 3-12 Here the ball
load distribution and magnitude can be visualized The higher
the peak, the higher the loads

Variable load cases
Often a bearing system must operate in several modes such as
“idle” and “working ” In this instance, the loads may vary sub-
stantially It is advantageous to calculate the life of the bearing
under the total loading spectrum To do this, the individual life
under each load case can be calculated alone, then combined to
provide the system life for a particular duty cycle
To perform this calculation, break the loading up into discrete
sections which can have their respective percentage of revolu-
tions represented as part of the total, such as:
Case 1 	Case 2 	Case 3
Radial1 	Radial2 	Radial3
Axial1 	Axial2 	Axial3
Moment1 	Moment2 	Moment3
% time1 	% time2 	% time3

Substitute the individual “Ln ” lives into the equation below with
“t n ” where tn = % timen

The principal function of a bearing separator is to space the
rolling elements uniformly, thereby preventing contact between
them Minute differentials in rolling element motion result from
differences in individual rolling element loads and the inherent
elasticity of bearing and mounting components Without a sep-
arator some rolling elements will eventually contact each other
Due to the shape of the rolling elements and the opposite direc-
tion of motion of the contacting surfaces, a combination of rela-
tively high contact stress and rapid motion is possible Conse-
quent abrasion of the rolling elements and residue of wear in
the raceways affect life and torque characteristics, limiting the
use of full complement bearings to slow speed applications
where relatively large torque variations can be tolerated
Kaydon separators for Reali-Slim bearings are designated by a
single letter character in coded part numbers (page 3), standard
P, R, L, and G separators have proved to be suitable for a wide
range of operating conditions Requirements, however, may
dictate the use of different materials This may affect capacities
For assistance in selecting Reali-Slim bearings, contact Kaydon
Engineering Operating temperatures for various separator
materials are shown on page 100
Continuous ring “snap-over
pocket” separator
Figure 4-1 - Pocket
Designed for use in bearing types C and X, this style is installed
after Conrad assembly of the races and balls The tangs of the
alternate “snap” pockets deform elastically to snap-over the
balls for retention of the separator Centered on the balls at
room temperature, the separator becomes outer race land rid-
ing or inner race land riding when temperatures cause differen-
tial thermal expansion or contraction
Close control of roundness and wall thickness insures effective
piloting in either case, limiting separator “whip” and friction
between the separator and race lands for smooth operation
Different materials are available for unusual operating con-
ditions including stainless steel and non-metallics such as
phenolic laminate, PTFE, and PEEK
• Stainless steel separators are used in stainless steel bearings
or high temperature applications for corrosion resistance
• Phenolic laminate is used where light weight and/or lubricant
absorption is desired
• The “snap-over” non-metallic separator is ideal for high-speed
applications of bearings too small in cross section for the two-
piece riveted design (bearing Series C and lighter sections) It is
also desirable in low speed, minimum torque applications
For more information on how to use our bearings, contact Kay-
don Engineering
Orientation
It is suggested that in an application where the bearing axis will
be within 45° of vertical, the bearing be positioned with separa-
tor pocket openings down or that a shoulder of the shaft or
housing be extended as added assurance of retention Sealed
and shielded bearings have this orientation instruction etched
on the O D by an arrow and the word “up” as shown below

Correct bearing orientation is shown.

Continuous ring circular
separators
Figure 4-3 - Continuous Ring Pocket
Figure 4-4 - Riveted Ring Circular Pocket
Designed for use in Type A bearings, the one-piece separator
shown in Figure 4-3 is positioned around the inner race with
the balls placed in pockets before the outer race is expanded
thermally and dropped over the balls This method of assembly
permits the use of more balls than in the Conrad bearing Types
C and X In addition to the standard separators of brass,
non-metallic composite and reinforced nylon, this style can be
furnished in phenolic laminate, stainless steel, and aluminum
Designed for use in non-standard bearings of Type C or Type X,
the separator shown in Figure 4-4 is installed after Conrad
assembly of the races and bearing and riveted together
Because of the space required for rivets, use is limited to Series
D and heavier sections Usually machined all over, this style is
recommended in phenolic laminate for very high speeds Where
very high strength is required, it is furnished in bronze, alumi-
num, or stainless steel
As in the case of the continuous ring “snap-over” pocket sep-
arator, both of these styles are centered on the balls at room
temperature, becoming either outer race land riding or inner
race land riding as the temperature changes
Segmental separators
Segmental separators of either the ring or “snap-over” design
offer advantages for certain applications
1 When larger diameter bearings are subjected to high tem-
peratures, expansion differentials between the separator and
the races may exceed the normal clearances provided
2 When oscillatory motion, variable loading and a vertical axis
combine to cause differential ball travel with no “vacation
zone,” torque may become objectionably high or erratic
A segmental separator may consist of a one-piece open ring or
it may be composed of two or more segments Where differen-
tial expansion creates a problem, sufficient clearance is pro-
vided between the ends of the open ring or between the several
segments to allow for this expansion Where torque is of con-
cern, the selection of the number of segments is made based
upon experience In all other respects, segmental separators
satisfy the above descriptions for Continuous Ring “Snap-over
Pocket” Separators or Continuous Ring “Circular Pocket”
Separators
Segmenting the separator imposes somewhat greater restric-
tions on the bearings Maximum allowable speed of rotation is
reduced due to the centrifugal force (“brake banding”) energized
by the segments against the outer race lands Also, in the case
of the “snap-over pocket” style, a shaft or housing shoulder
should be extended to assure retention of the separator irre-
spective of the operating position of the bearing See next page

Separator types
Formed wire separator
Figure 4-5
When the need exists for maximum capacity and thus the
greatest possible number of balls, a formed wire separator
may be used to avoid the disadvantages of a full complement
bearing It has been most successfully employed in Type A
bearings, where the greater number of balls can be installed
without resorting to use of a loading slot Use in bearing Types
C and X should be restricted to very low speed applications
Comparatively high wear rate coupled with relatively light sec-
tion can cause the wear life of the wire separator to be a limit-
ing factor in the life a bearing, especially if the loads are high
However, where weight or space are at a premium and the
added capacity is an important consideration, this separator
may be considered a good compromise
A bearing with a wire separator and maximum allowable ball
complement has a static load capacity of 180% of the catalog
static rating
Toroid separators

PTFE spacer slugs
Figure 4-6B
Spacer balls
Figure 4-6C
Helical spring separators
Figure 4-6D
In some critical positioning applications, uniformity of torque
is more important than the actual mean torque level Specially
designed toroids (Figure 4-6A), PTFE spacer slugs (Figure
4-6B), spacer balls (Figure 4-6C) or helical compression
springs (Figure 4-6D) have proven in a number of such
instances to be satisfactory for ball separation – by their
nature they give a large amount of individual and cumulative
circumferential freedom to the balls To prevent this freedom
from being abused, however, speeds must be low and loads
comparatively light
Applications involving use of these separators should be
referred to Kaydon engineering for review and
recommendation

The following limiting speed information is provided for refer-
ence only For actual speeds, use the Reali-Design software
found on our website, www kaydonbearings com
The determination of maximum safe operating speeds is largely
empirical Various complex factors play a part in limiting the
speed of rotation, some of which are:
• Bearing diameter
• Ratio of bearing diameter to cross-section
• Bearing type and internal configuration
• Ratio of ball groove radius to ball diameter
• Bearing internal fit-up (diametral clearance or preload)
• Operating contact angle(s)
• Bearing precision (runouts)
• Ball separator material and design
• Precision of mount (roundness, flatness under load)
• Lubrication
• Ambient temperature and provision for heat dissipation
• Seals
• Loads
• Life requirement
While precise speed limits cannot be set, experience in actual
applications and in the Kaydon test laboratories can serve as
a basis for setting general limits Figure 4-9 takes into
account some of the factors and assumes proper installation
and adequate provision for heat dissipation These limits are
based upon achieving the full service life of 1,000,000 revo-
lutions If a shorter life is acceptable, higher speeds may be
tolerated, except for bearings using formed wire and helical
spring separators
For speeds near or over the limits in the table, special attention
must be given to lubrication and heat Greases should be of
types specially formulated for high speed bearings Frequency
of regreasing must be adequate to insure presence of lubricant
at all times If oil is used, viscous drag should be minimized by
controlling the level, using slingers and/or metering small
amounts as a liquid or mist Windage effects at high speeds can
make the introduction of oil to the critical surfaces very difficult,
and the design of the lubrication system then becomes impor-
tant Please consult lubrication manufacturer
Generally speaking, operating temperature will be limited by the
allowable maximum temperature for the lubricant If, however,
bearing temperature is expected to exceed 250°F for extended
periods, the bearings should be given stabilization treatment by
Kaydon This treatment will permit operation at temperatures
up to 400°F
While maximum temperature is important, consideration must
also be given to possible temperature differential across the
bearing Generally, heat is lost through the housing at a higher
rate than through the shaft The housing fit and the bearing
internal clearance before installation must be sufficient to allow
for this as well as for the shaft fit if the necessary running clear-
ance is to be realized

Torque considerations
Torque, as it applies to bearings, is defined as the moment
required to turn the rotating race with respect to the
stationary race
Usually the torque requirement of a ball bearing is only a small
part of the demand of a mechanical system In many Reali-Slim
bearing applications, however, masses and consequent inertias
are slight and the amount of work being done is not great In
such cases, it may be important to know as accurately as possi-
ble how much turning effort must be provided
Many factors contribute to the resistance to rotation of a lightly
loaded anti-friction bearing, and most of this resistance comes
from the more unpredictable ones–separator drag; viscous drag
of the lubricant; minute deviations from true geometry in the
balls, race ways, and mounting surfaces of bearing, shaft, and
housing; internal fit-up of the bearing; and the presence of
contaminants
Bearings can be furnished to a maximum torque level specification
In the selection of the lubricant and lubricating system, their
effects on torque should be kept in mind To be considered are
operating temperatures; speeds of rotation; type, viscosity and
quantity of lubricant All are major factors in determining lubri-
cant drag Please consult lubrication manufacturer
In tolerancing the shaft and housing it is important to set limits
for out-of-roundness and out-of-flatness of the bearing seats
For normal requirements a good rule of thumb is to use the
bearing radial and axial runout tolerances as the respective lim-
its For critical torque applications, closer tolerances should be
specified since even a very small amount of localized internal
preload (negative clearance) will create surprisingly large ball
loads and consequent high torque Where torque must be mini-
mized it is important to limit out-of-roundness of housing or
shaft to values which will insure against complete loss of inter-
nal clearance
Cleanliness is extremely important in maintaining uniformity of
torque as well as a low level of torque Very small amounts of
microscopic particles of lint, dust, and other common contami-
nants can cause bearing torque to vary several hundred percent
in just a few degrees of rotation For this reason bearings should
be kept in their original unopened package until time for instal-
lation Every effort should be made to protect them from foreign
matter, whether or not torque is critical
The accompanying charts show approximate torque levels of
Reali-Slim bearings under stated conditions Estimates can be
furnished for more unusual situations Information submitted
should contain all operating conditions of load, speed, lubricant,
and environment (including temperature), together with a print
of the intended mounting, showing materials and radial sec-
tions If a limit has been set on permissible system error in
terms of axis deviation – radial translation, axial translation, or
angular rotation (page 108) – this information should also be
submitted
Additional processing is used to achieve the lowest possible torque levels High preci-
sion races and balls, super-finished ball tracks, and precisely set internal fit-ups
assure optimum performance

Reali-Slim bearings are often used in applications where the
position of a rotating part relative to the stationary structure is
critical Knowledge of the displacement of the axis of rotation
and the factors contributing to it are thus important
The axis of rotation can be displaced from its true position in
three ways–radially, axially, and angularly These deviations are
referred to as radial translation, axial translation, and tilt (angu-
lar rotation) respectively
In addition to the obvious effects of bearing runout, total devia-
tion of bearing axis in any one of the above conditions is due to
the effects of bearing diametral clearance and elastic deflection
(deformation) at the ball or roller contacts The diametral clear-
ance after installation changes due to the combined effects of
external fitting practice, differential thermal expansion or con-
traction of the bearing races and mounting structures, and rela-
tive rigidity of the races and mating parts
Elastic deflection at the ball or roller contacts results from the
externally applied bearing loads and is influenced by ball or
roller diameter, race groove radius, raceway diameters, and
contact angle
The following three equations are given to aid in determining
displacement The internal diametral clearance (DC) must be
calculated or approximated The remaining independent varia-
bles can calculated with Kaydon's easy-to-use Reali-Design
software (see pages 110-111)

Introduction: Reali-Slim thin section ball bearings have a
cross-section thickness that is much thinner than standard
bearings of the same diameter, and are therefore more sensi-
tive to shaft and housing fits Proper mounting is essential to
make sure that the bearing functions as intended There are a
number of factors to consider when mounting a bearing,
including: bearing style and orientation, the direction and mag-
nitude of the applied loads, allowable free play in the bearing,
the maximum allowable torque, shaft and housing materials,
operating temperature, and which ring is rotating
Radial (Type C) Bearings: Radial bearings are typically used
when the applied loads are predominantly in the radial direc-
tion If two bearings are used on opposite ends of a long shaft,
then one of the bearings should be allowed to float in the axial
direction (see Figure 5-1) This is done so that thermal expan-
sion of the shaft or housing does not induce an axial (thrust)
force into the radial bearing
Figure 5-1
Radial Load
The recommended shaft and housing sizes for radial bearings
are found in the tolerance tables Kaydon generally recom-
mends a light press fit between the bearing and either the shaft
or housing, whichever side is rotating A slight amount of clear-
ance is recommended for the non-rotating (stationary) side
Most radial bearings are supplied with an internal diametral
clearance Using the recommended fits assures that the bear-
ings will not become radially tight after installation, which could
affect bearing life and performance
Please note that the recommended fits apply only to bearings
with “standard” clearance, which is also shown in the tolerance
tables They also apply only to steel shafts and housings, or
room temperature applications If dissimilar metals are used,
then the fits will change with temperature This could cause the
bearing to become radially tight, leading to excessive friction
torque When bearings are supplied with a diametral preload, a
slight clearance is recommended for both the shaft and housing
Kaydon also recommends that face clamps (See Figure 5-2) be
used with all bearings The user should not rely solely on a press
fit to hold the bearing in place

Four-Point Contact (Type X) Bearings: Four-point contact
bearings are used when there is an axial (thrust) applied load
or some combination of radial, thrust and moment loads If
two bearings are used on the opposite ends of a long shaft,
the second bearing should be a radial (Type C) bearing, and it
should be allowed to float as shown in Figure 5-3 Kaydon
does not recommend using two four-point contact bearings
on the same shaft

be supplied with a diametral preload Where preloaded bearings
are used, there should be a slight clearance to both the shaft
and housing

Mounting
A single four-point contact bearing is capable of taking an axial
(thrust) load in both directions It is also capable of taking radial
and moment loads However, this type of bearing typically has
higher friction than a radial (Type C) or an angular contact (Type
A) bearing of the same size Therefore, for torque-sensitive and
high-speed applications, duplex pairs of angular contact bear-
ings are generally used in place of a single four-point contact
bearing
Angular Contact (Type A) Bearings: Angular contact ball bear-
ings can take an axial (thrust) load in only one direction, and
therefore are almost always used in pairs They can be used in
either a back-to-back (DB) arrangement or a face-to-face (DF)
arrangement, as described in the Bearing Selection section on
page 91 Angular contact pairs are normally used with some
amount of axial preload to remove all free play and increase
stiffness Angular contact bearings can be purchased as
matched pairs where the axial preload is set by the factory, or as
individual bearings where the axial preload is set during
installation
When angular contact bearings are purchased as a matched
pair – called a “duplex pair” – the inner and outer rings simply
need to be clamped in place as shown in Figure 5-4 For bear-
ings with an axial preload, there should be a slight clearance
between the bearing and both the shaft and housing If a third
bearing is used on the opposite end of a long shaft, it should be
either a single radial or a face-to-face (DF) pair It should also be
free to float in the axial direction, (see Figure 5-4) Kaydon
does not normally recommend using two back-to-back (DB)
bearing pairs on the same shaft

Back-To-Back (DB) Mounting: If angular contact bearings are
purchased as individual bearings, the axial preload needs to be
set during installation If the bearings are used in a back-to-
back (DB) arrangement, the preload is set by pressing the inner
rings of the two bearings toward each other The axial preload is
set using shims, as shown in Figure 5-5

If the thrust load is applied in only one direction, then the

For a back-to-back (DB) mounting, Kaydon typically recom-
mends using a slight press fit between the bearing OD and the
housing A clearance fit is required between bearing and shaft so
the inner rings are free to move in the axial direction The rec-
ommended shaft and housing sizes are shown in the tolerance
tables Please note that these fits are for steel shafts and hous-
ings or for room temperature applications If dissimilar metals
are used, then the fits will change with temperature In that case
looser fits may be advisable to prevent excessive friction torque
at high and low temperatures
The life and load-carrying capacity of a pair of angular contact
bearings under an applied moment load can be increased by
spacing the bearings further apart (Fig 5-7) The angular
deflection (tilt) of the shaft under an applied moment also
decreases as the spacing increases However, the bearings can
become more sensitive to differential thermal expansion if the
shaft and housing are different materials or if they operate at
different temperatures
Figure 5-7
Shim for adjustment
Face-To-Face (DF) Mounting: In a face-to-face (DF) mounting,
the preload is set by pressing the outer rings toward each other
(Fig 5-8) The preload can also be set with shims or wave
springs For this type of mounting a slight press fit is used
between the bearing I D and the shaft A slight clearance is
required between the bearing O D and housing The recom-
mended shaft and housing sizes for DF mounting can be found
in the tolerance tables As with the DB mounting, if dissimilar
metals are used then looser fits may be necessary to prevent
excessive friction torque at high and low temperatures

Orientation: Kaydon recommends that radial (Type C) and
four-point contact (Type X) bearings that use a “snap-over” or
“crown” type ball separator be mounted with the solid side of
the separator facing up and the pocket openings facing down if
the shaft orientation is within 45° of vertical These bearings are
marked with an “UP” arrow to show proper orientation For
horizontal shafts, there is no preferred orientation
Figure 5-9
Single angular contact (Type A) bearings can only take an axial
(thrust) load in one direction The outside diameter of these
bearings is marked with an arrow and the word “THRUST” to
indicate the direction that a thrust load can be applied to the
outer ring
When these bearings are mounted in a back-to-back (DB)
arrangement, the arrows should point away from each other In
a face-to-face (DF) arrangement, the arrows should point
toward each other
Figure 5-10
Angular contact bearings purchased as a matched (duplex) set
will have a “V” marked across the O D and I D of both bearings
During installation these “V” marks should be aligned with each
other (For vertical shafts it does not matter whether the “V” is
facing up or down ) The “V” marks are located at the high point
of radial runout These can be matched to the low point on the
shaft and housing to reduce the assembled runout

Mounting
Shaft and Housing Tolerances: Since their cross-sections are
much thinner than standard bearings of the same diameter,
Reali-Slim thin section ball bearings are very sensitive to shaft
and housing geometry After installation the bearing tends to
take the shape of shaft and housing, so the roundness of the
shaft and housing is very important, as is the flatness of the
bearing seats Therefore, Kaydon recommends the following:
• The flatness tolerance for the bearing seat in the outer hous-
ing should be the same as the axial runout of the outer ring of
the bearing
• The roundness tolerance for the outer housing should be the
same as the radial runout of the outer ring of the bearing
• The roundness tolerance for the shaft should be the same as
the radial runout of the inner ring
• The flatness tolerance for the bearing seat on the shaft
should be the same as the axial runout tolerance of
the inner ring

Housing 	Shaft
Both the shaft and the housing should have a shallow lead-in
chamfer for ease of assembly The fillet radii at the corner of the
bearing seats should be smaller than the chamfer on the bear-
ing (dimension “F” in the bearing tables) Where interference fits
are used, heat or cold should be used to increase clearance and
ease assembly Allow the assembly to return to room tempera-
ture before tightening any fasteners
If a press fit must be used, then Kaydon recommends applying
uniform pressure over the entire face of the bearing Always
press on the ring with the interference fit For example, if a
press fit is used between the bearing and the shaft, then press
on the inner ring, not the outer WARNING – Never press across
the races, as this can damage the bearing
Preload: The optimal preload for any bearing depends on the
application As the preload increases, the amount of deflection
under load is reduced (see Figure 5-13) and the bearing stiff-
ness and natural frequency increase However, increased
preload also leads to higher friction torque Kaydon’s free Rea-
li-Design software can be used to calculate the amount of
deflection under an applied load for various amounts of preload
This tool can also be used to calculate the amount of preload
needed for any given application

Clamp Rings: Kaydon recommends that face clamps be used
with all bearings The user should not rely solely on a press fit to
hold the bearing in place Overlapping the clamp rings to form a
labyrinth shield, as shown in Figure 5-2, is recommended This
helps keep lubricant in the bearing and contamination out For
bearings used in harsh environments, external seals are
recommended
To provide a uniform clamping force, a large number of
small fasteners is preferable to a few large ones The fasteners
should be tightened in a “star” pattern to evenly distribute the
clamping force
Lubrication: Standard open bearings are shipped with preserv-
ative oil that is not intended to be a working lubricant Prior to
installation, the bearings should be cleaned and then lubricated
with an oil or grease suitable for the loads, speed, temperature,
and environment

Inspection
The unique proportions of Reali-Slim bearings make some of
the usual gaging practices impractical Since very light pressure
is sufficient to deflect the thin rings, conventional two-point
measurement of bearing bore and outside diameter must not
be used Air gages of the open jet type, or other proximity
devices, must be used to hold error from distortion to an
acceptable level Measurements must be made at enough
points to yield a true average size, which may not be the mean
of the maximum and minimum measurement A Reali-Slim
bearing may be out-of-round in the free state1 more than the
ABMA tolerance for its precision class This presents no problem
since the races will conform readily to a round shaft diameter
and housing bore
To determine the true runout of each race, by excluding the
effect of out of roundness, measurement is made of variation in
individual wall thickness This is schematically illustrated in Fig-
ure 5-14 The indicator must contact the raceway at the ball or
roller contact, and must be properly positioned for the particu-
lar runout (axial or radial) being checked
Measurement of radial runout
of Type C inner race
Figure 5-14
Diametral clearance of Reali-Slim bearings is controlled by
selective assembly of races and balls following measurement
with gages specially designed for this purpose
Standard inspection and quality control procedures at Kaydon
meet the requirements of government procurement agencies
and major aerospace industries However, a certificate of com-
pliance to specifications can be furnished if required
Installation
To realize the potential accuracy and long life of a Reali-Slim
bearing, it is important that the installation be properly done in
a clean environment Cleanliness is vital to satisfactory bearing
performance Work surfaces and tools must be free of dirt,
chips, and burrs Disposable wipers or clean, lint-free cloths
should be used
Under no circumstances should a bearing be used as a gage
during grinding or machining of mating parts Just a few grains
of grinding grit or chips of metal (soft as well as hard) can seri-
ously damage the precise geometry and finishes of bearing
raceways and rolling elements, and are nearly impossible to
remove from an assembled bearing
The shaft and housing should be thoroughly cleaned, special
attention being given to holes and crevices which could hold
dirt, chips, and cutting oil Unfinished surfaces of castings
should be painted or otherwise sealed The mounting surfaces
for the bearing must be carefully checked, cleaned, and lightly
oiled to ease fitting and minimize danger of scoring Housing
bore, shaft diameter, shoulder squareness, and fillet sizes
should all be verified
The bearing should not be removed from its protective package
until this preparation is complete and it is time for installation

Interference fitting any bearing to the shaft or housing must be
carefully done to avoid damage to the bearing For Reali-Slim
bearings, the use of temperature difference to expand the outer
member is recommended to minimize or eliminate the installa-
tion force necessary To calculate the differential required, use a
coefficient of expansion of 000007 inch per inch per degree F
for AISI 52100 steel races and 0000056 for AISI 440C races
For a Kaydon Precision Class 1 bearing of 2” bore to be fitted to a
steel shaft, the differential required to eliminate all interference
between a maximum diameter shaft and minimum diameter
bearing is 90°F; for a 4” bore it is 60°F Either dry heat or hot oil
may be used Electrical resistance tape is convenient for the
large bearings Care must be taken to avoid overheating the
bearing Do not exceed 250°F
If pressure is necessary, an arbor press should be used with a
suitable pusher to apply the force to the full face of the ring
being press fitted – never through the bearing, as damage will
be done to the balls and raceways
All duplexed bearings are marked with a single “V” on the
bores and outside diameters to indicate the proper relative cir-
cumferential position of inner and outer races This “V” is
located at the high points of race eccentricity so that these may
be placed at the low points of shaft and housing eccentricity for
the canceling effect
Figure 5-15
Correct
Incorrect
After mounting, the bearings must be given continued protec-
tion from contamination until the assembly is closed Adherence
to these procedures will assure a successful installation
If it is necessary to return a bearing to Kaydon, it should be
coated with protective oil and wrapped the same as when
shipped from the factory to prevent damage during transit If
bearings are being returned after use for a failure analysis, they
should be returned in the as removed condition, since the con-
dition of the part (cleanliness, lubricated condition, etc ) will
provide important data for failure analysis

The lubricant in an anti-friction bearing serves to reduce fric-
tion and wear between moving parts, to dissipate heat, and to
prevent corrosion of critical surfaces Kaydon recommends the
selection of the proper lubricant be based on an evaluation by
the system design engineer of the operating conditions, includ-
ing at a minimum: rotational speed, type and magnitude of
loads, and ambient temperature
The three types of lubricant commonly used are oil, grease, and
dry film or surface treatment
Oil normally provides more complete lubrication Because of its
liquid state, it provides better coverage of the critical surfaces
and assists in dissipating heat more readily, the latter being
especially true when circulation and cooling are provided In
high-speed applications where the heating effect is more pro-
nounced, oil is specified (see page 105) Where minimum torque
is a requirement, oil will usually provide lower friction values
Grease offers certain advantages of its own Because it is more
easily retained, the design of bearing housings and seals is sim-
plified In many applications, the lubricant itself serves to
exclude contaminants when used in conjunction with labyrinths
or close clearances between the rotating and stationary struc-
tures For the higher speeds within the range suitable for grease
lubrication, a channeling type of grease is often selected
Dry films and surface treatments have been used as bearing
lubricants in applications subject to environmental extremes,
particularly where conventional lubricants cannot be tolerated
or will not survive A wide variety of types are available for
selection; options include Tungsten disulfide, graphite, and
Molybdenum disulfide
It is important to note that the quantity of lubricant affects
bearing performance under certain operating conditions Only
relatively small amounts of lubricant are necessary to reduce
friction and wear if a film can be maintained on all contacting
surfaces Where speed is significant, excessive amounts of oil or
grease will result in higher operating temperatures, leading to
the possibility of early bearing fatigue Depending on the bear-
ing design and application, typical grease fill volumes vary from
10% to 30% of the free space available in the bearing
Unsealed bearings are supplied with a coating of preserva-
tive-type lubricating oil for the prevention of corrosion dur-
ing storage Kaydon recommends that this preservative be
removed with clean petroleum solvent prior to lubrication If the
lubricant is not removed, the compatibility of the lubricant with
the preservative oil must be confirmed
In applications where minimum torque is required, the coating
should be removed by washing with a clean petroleum solvent
followed by immediate relubrication with an oil selected for the
application An option is to have Reali-Slim bearings factory
lubricated with a commercial grease or oil selected by the cus-
tomer in order to facilitate installation
Sealed bearings are packed approximately one-third full with a
multi-purpose industrial grease Exterior surfaces are given a
light coating of the same lubricant for protection during storage
in the original package

Bearings, with or without seals, can be supplied with optional
lubricants Shown in the accompanying table are some of the
greases and oils more frequently specified Several have been
developed to meet the requirements of unusual operating con-
ditions Because of this and the variation in cost, it is recom-
mended that lubricants be selected with the assistance of a
lubrication expert
Due to the finite shelf life of any wet lubricant, factory lubricated
bearings should not be held more than two years prior to use
Contact Kaydon for refurbishment instructions for product held
beyond two years of receipt
To realize the full potential of a Reali-Slim bearing, Kaydon
recommends that the customer’s maintenance instructions
and schedules consider the operating conditions and
include procedures to assure the bearings are adequately
protected against the intrusion of foreign matter of all
types, and fresh oil or grease introduced with sufficient fre-
quency to cleanse the bearing and assure adequate
lubrication

The Reali-Slim thin section bearing product line has been
expanded to include several additional bearing series specifi-
cally engineered to bring the advantages of Reali-Slim bearings
to designs intended for service in the most severe or extreme
environments We offer Reali-Slim bearings with a variety of
packaged features to meet specific operation requirements
Harsh environments (S,N)
Kaydon stainless steel bearings are used where high
precision and corrosion resistance are required
Reali-Slim thin section bearings are available in AISI 440C
stainless steel races (S) or with Kaydon's exclusive Endurakote
plating (N) They are offered in either radial contact “C,” angular
contact “A,” or four-point contact “X” configurations These
bearings are available in popular sizes and minimize the surface
degradation and particulate formation so common in harsh
environment applications (See pages 59-71 )
Low particle generation/marginal
lubrication (X,Y)
Hybrid bearings are very well suited for applications
where lubrication is marginal
Applications requiring low particle generation, high accuracy,
high speeds, and/or which must operate in adverse or no-lube
conditions, can benefit from hybrid bearings Tests have shown
that significant reductions in particle generation can be
obtained with hybrid designs which incorporate the use of
ceramic rolling elements on hardened steel races In addition,
the physical properties of the ceramic rolling elements (preci-
sion, hardness, light weight) provide additional benefits such as
improved repeata bility, low torque, high stiffness, and resist-
ance to wear under marginal or no-lube conditions
High performance, low torque (Q)
Series Q high-performance bearings are used where low fric-
tion torque, smooth operation, and high positional accuracy are
required Series Q high-performance bearings are generally
limited to angular contact bearings supplied in either a back-to-
back (DB) or face-to-face (DF) configuration These bearings are
made from Precision Class 6 Reali-Slim components with the
following special modifications:
• Low-torque toroid ball spacers
• Special cleanroom cleaning
• Special lubrication
• Grade 10 balls or better
• Special ball path finishing
• Special preload assembly
High temperature (M)
Standard bearings are processed for operating temperatures up
to 250°F At temperatures beyond this limit, reductions in
material hardness can affect bearing capacity, which will reduce
the bearing's theoretical fatigue life When full capacity is
required at higher temperatures, the use of series "M" bearings
may be required Manufactured from M50 tool steel for balls
and races and assembled with stainless steel cages, these bear-
ings can provide full bearing capacity at temperatures greater
than 250°F However, careful consideration to the bearing lubri-
cant must also be exercised

Chemical Resistant (P)
In applications where both corrosion resistance and chemical
resistance are required, series P bearings may be required
These bearings feature AISI 17-4PH steel races and ceramic
balls They are manufactured to provide a greater level of corro-
sion and chemical resistance than either Kaydon Series N or
Series S bearings Due to the hardening limitations of AISI
17-4PH steel, an adjustment factor of 17 must be applied to the
standard dynamic capacity ratings Thus, the use of P Series
bearings should be carefully reviewed prior to selection to
determine if the life and capacity are adequate
Tremendous benefits in performance can be obtained by
matching not just size but also material to the application
These alternative race and ball materials interact differently
than traditional chrome steel bearings Capacities, life calcula-
tions and stiffness will differ from other products in this catalog

The Kaydon concept of stand-
ard bearings with lightweight,
thin sections and large bore
diameters includes tapered
and radial roller bearings as
well as ball bearings
KT Series tapered roller bear-
ings offer advantages to those
designs requiring a bearing of
higher capacity, which would
benefit from the many unique
advantages of a thin section
bearing KT tapered roller bearings are used to advantage in
applications ranging from oil field equipment to machine tool
tables where space and weight considerations are meaningful
KT Series standard tapered roller bearings have races and roll-
ers of through-hardened AISI 52100 steel with a one-piece
stamped steel cage When specified, they can be furnished in
pairs, match ground for use with or without spacers
The tapered roller bearings in this catalog are of the single-row
radial type, designed primarily for application of radial load
While of separable construction, the rolling elements are
retained in the separator
Since this bearing assumes a contact angle of approximately
12° under an axial force, it does have a reasonable amount of
thrust capacity This capacity is unidirectional and is realized
when the axial force is applied to the wide faces of the races
As in the case of the angular contact ball bearing, the single row
tapered roller bearing is commonly mounted in opposition to
another bearing (usually of similar construction) to provide an
axial force for establishing and maintaining the angle of contact
Two bearings of this type maybe mounted with the lines of con-
tact converging outside of the bearings (back-to-back) or inside
(face-to-face) with the former preferred for stability in the pres-
ence of overturning load

Axial Clearance:
The total amount of free axial movement between the inner
and outer race of a bearing Bearings with internal clearance
will contain both axial and radial clearance
Axial Load:
Load applied to the bearing parallel with the bearing axis of
rotation — also known as thrust load
Capacity:
Dynamic capacity is the basic “C” rating which represents a load
that the bearing can theoretically endure for 1 million revolu-
tions Static capacity is the approximate load the bearing can
endure before permanent deformation occurs on the ball or
raceway Published capacities do not apply to hybrid series
bearings P, X, and Y Contact Kaydon product engineering for
additional information
Deflection:
The amount of movement associated with compression or
stretching of bearing components when placed under load
Diameter Tolerance:
The range in which the average diameter of a bore or O D may
fall Reali-Slim bearings are considered “non-rigid” rings and all
diameters are averaged using multi-point gaging techniques
per ABMA Std 26 2
Diametral Clearance:
The total free movement of the inner race relative to the outer
race in a radial plane, also referred to as radial clearance “X”
and “C” type bearings are made with some internal clearance as
a standard factory internal fit before mounting
L10 Life:
The theoretical life span of a bearing under a specific set of
dynamic operating conditions associated with 90% reliability
Moment Load:
Load such that when applied to a bearing system, tends to
overturn or bend the axis of rotation in an angular direction
Pitch Diameter:
The theoretical median diameter of a bearing, which passes
through the center of the rolling elements Reali-Slim pitch
diameters are equivalent to: (OD+Bore)/2
Preload:
The amount of load placed on the rolling elements before the
application of any external loads Preload can be created in “X”
and “C” type bearings by controlling internal fits of the ball and
the raceway at the factory Preload in angular contact bearings
is controlled by a “preload gap” between the duplexed races
Tight mounting conditions will increase the final bearing
preload Preload stiffens the bearing and eliminates axial and
radial play, but the load on the balls increases friction and
shortens L10 life
Radial Load:
Load applied perpendicular to the bearing axis of rotation
Runout:
The maximum axial or radial race wall thickness variation of an
inner or outer bearing race Runout influences the repeatable
location variation of rotating components
