1-1 	Structure
Rolling bearings (bearings hereinafter)
normally comprise bearing rings, rolling ele-
ments and a cage (see Fig. 1-1).
Rolling elements are arranged between
inner and outer rings with a cage, which
retains the rolling elements in correct relative
position, so they do not touch one another.
With this structure, a smooth rolling motion
is realized during operation.
Bearings are classified as follows, by the
number of rows of rolling elements: single-
row, double-row, or multi-row (triple- or four-
row) bearings.
1) Bearing rings
The path of the rolling elements is called
the raceway; and, the section of the bearing
rings where the elements roll is called the
raceway surface. In the case of ball bearings,
since grooves are provided for the balls, they
are also referred to as raceway grooves.
The inner ring is normally engaged with a
shaft; and, the outer ring with a housing.
Fig. 1-1 Bearing structure
1. Rolling bearing structures and types
2) Rolling element
Rolling elements may be either balls or
rollers. Many types of bearings with various
shapes of rollers are available.
3) Cage
The cage guides the rolling elements
along the bearing rings, retaining the rolling
elements in correct relative position.
There are various types of cages including
pressed, machined, molded, and pin type
cages.
Due to lower friction resistance than that
found in full complement roller and ball bear-
ings, bearings with a cage are more suitable
for use under high speed rotation.
1-2 	Type
The contact angle (α) is the angle formed
by the direction of the load applied to the
bearing rings and rolling elements, and a
plan perpendicular to the shaft center, when
the bearing is loaded.
Bearings are classified into two types in
accordance with the contact angle (α).
• Radial bearings (0˚ ≤ α ≤ 45˚)
... designed to accommodate
mainly radial load.
• Thrust bearings (45˚ < α ≤ 90˚)
... designed to accommodate
mainly axial load.
Rolling bearings are classified in Fig. 1-2,
and characteristics of each bearing type are
described in Tables 1-1 to 1-8.

n The most popular types among rolling bearings,
widely used in a variety of industries.
n Radial load and axial load in both directions can be
accommodated.
n Suitable for operation at high speed, with low noise
and low vibration.
n Sealed bearings employing steel shields or rubber
seals are filled with the appropriate volume of grease
when manufactured.
n Bearings with a flange or locating snap ring attached
on the outer ring are easily mounted in housings for
simple positioning of housing location.
n In spite of having the same boundary dimensions as
standard bearings, maximum type bearings have a
higher load rating because a filling slot on each of
the inner and outer rings, allows a greater number of
balls to be inserted than do standard bearings.

n Bearing rings and balls possess their own contact angle which is normally
15˚, 30˚ or 40˚.
Larger contact angle ... higher resistance against axial load
Smaller contact angle ... more advantageous for high-speed rotation
n Single-row bearings can accommodate radial load and axial load in one
direction.
n DB and DF matched pair bearings and double-row bearings can accommo-
date radial load and axial load in both directions.
DT matched pair bearings are used for applications where axial load in one
direction is too large for one bearing to accept.
n ACH type high speed bearings were designed to contain more balls than
standard bearings by minimizing the ball diameter, to offer improved perfor-
mance in machine tools.
n Angluar contact ball bearings are used for high accuracy and high-speed
operation.
n Axial load in both direc-
tions and radial load can
be accommodated by
adapting a structure pair-
ing two single-row angu-
lar contact ball bearings
back to back.
n For bearings with no fill-
ing slot, the sealed type
is available.

n Since the design allowing linear contact of cylindrical
rollers with the raceway provides strong resistance
to radial load, this type is suitable for use under
heavy radial load and impact load, as well as at
high speed.
n N and NU types are ideal for use on the free side :
they are movable in the shaft direction in response to
changes in bearing position relative to the shaft or
housing, which are caused by heat expansion of the
shaft or improper mounting.
n NJ and NF types can accommodate axial load in one
direction ; and NH and NUP types can accommo-
date partial axial load in both directions.
n With separable inner and outer ring, this type
ensures easy mounting.
n Due to their high rigidity, NNU and NN types are
widely used in machine tool spindles.

n Tapered rollers assembled in the bearings are guid-
ed by the cone back face rib.
n The raceway surfaces of cone and cup and the
rolling contact surface of rollers are designed so that
the respective apexes converge at a point on the
bearing center line.
n Single-row bearings can accommodate radial load
and axial load in one direction, and double-row bear-
ings can accommodate radial load and axial load in
both directions.
n This type of bearing is suitable for use under heavy
load or impact load.
n Bearings are classified into standard, intermediate
and steep types, in accordance with their coctact
angle (α).
The larger the contact angle is, the greater the bear-
ing resistance to axial load.
n Since cup and cone assembly can be separated
from each other, mounting is easy.
n Bearings designated by the suffix " J " and " JR " are
interchangeable internationally.
n Items sized in inches are still widely used.

n Spherical roller bearings comprising barrel-shaped
convex rollers, double-row inner ring and outer ring
are classified into three types : R (RR), RH (RHR)
and RHA, according to their internal structure.
n With the bearing designed such that the circular
arc center of the outer ring raceway matches with
the bearing center, the bearing is self-aligning,
insensitive to errors of alignment of the shaft rela-
tive to the housing, and to shaft bending.
n This type can accommodate radial load and axial
load in both directions, which makes it especially
suitable for applications in which heavy load or
impact load is applied.
n The tapered bore type can be easily mounted /
dismounted by using an adapter or withdrawal
sleeve.
There are two types of tapered bores
(tapered ratio) :
1 : 30 	supplementary ...Suitable for
code K30 	series 240 and 241.
1 : 12 	supplementary ...Suitable for series
code K 	other than 240 and 241.
n Lubrication holes, a lubrication groove and anti-
rotation pin hole can be provided on the outer
ring. Lubrication holes and a lubrication groove
can be provided on the inner ring, too.

n This type of bearing comprises washer-shaped
rings with raceway groove and ball and cage
assembly.
n Washers to be mounted on shafts are called shaft
washers (or inner rings); and, washers to be
mounted into housings are housing washers (or
outer rings).
Central washers of double direction bearings are
mounted on the shafts.
n Single direction bearings accommodate axial load
in one direction, and double direction bearings
accommodate axial load in both directions.
(Both of these bearings cannot accommodate
radial loads.)
n Since bearings with a spherical back face are
self-aligning, it helps to compensate for mounting
errors.

n This type of bearing, comprising barrel-shaped
convex rollers arranged at an angle with the axis,
is self-aligning due to spherical housing washer
raceway; therefore, shaft inclination can be com-
pensated for to a certain degree.
n Great axial load resistance is provided.
This type can accommodate a small amount of
radial load as well as heavy axial load.
n Normally, oil lubrication is employed.

Remarks) 1. For measured clearance, the increase of radial internal clearance caused by the measurement load should be
added to the values in the above table for correction. Amounts for correction are as shown below.
Of the amounts for clearance correction in the C2 column, the smaller is applied to the minimum clearance, the
larger to the maximum clearance.
2. Values typed in Italics are based on the Koyo standards.
Remark) For measured clearance, the following amounts should be added for correction.
Extra-small ball bearing : 9 mm or larger in outside diameter and under 10 mm in bore diameter
Miniature ball bearing 	: Under 9 mm in outside diameter

4. Handling of bearings
A 22
4-1 	General instructions
Since rolling bearings are more precisely
made than other machine parts, careful
handling is absolutely necessary.
1) Keep bearings and the operating environ-
ment clean.
2) Handle carefully.
Bearings can be cracked and brinelled
easily by strong impact if handled roughly.
3) Handle using the proper tools.
4) Keep bearings well protected from rust.
Do not handle bearings in high humidity.
Operators should wear gloves in order not
to soil bearings with perspiration from
their hands.
5) Bearings should be handled by experi-
enced or well trained operators.
6) Set bearing operation standards and fol-
low them.
• Storage of bearings
• Cleaning of bearings and their adjoining
parts
• Inspection of dimensions of adjoining
parts and finish conditions
• Mounting
• Inspection after mounting
• Dismounting
• Maintenance and inspection
(periodical inspection)
• Replenishment of lubricants
4-2 	Storage of bearings
In shipping bearings, since they are cov-
ered with proper anti-corrosion oil and are
wrapped in antitarnish paper, the quality of
the bearings is guaranteed as long as the
wrapping paper is not damaged.
If bearings are to be stored for a long
time, it is advisable that the bearings be
stored on shelves set higher than 30 cm
from the floor, at a humidity less than 65%,
and at a temperature around 20˚C.
Avoid storage in places exposed directly
to the sun's rays or placing boxes of bear-
ings against cold walls.
4-3 	Bearing mounting
4-3-1 	Recommended preparation prior
to mounting
1) Preparation of bearings
Wait until just before mounting before
removing the bearings from their packaging
to prevent contamination and rust.
Since the anti-corrosion oil covering bear-
ings is a highly capable lubricant, the oil
should not be cleaned off if the bearings are
pre-lubricated, or when the bearings are
used for normal operation. However, if the
bearings are used in measuring instruments
or at high rotation speed, the anti-corrosion
oil should be removed using a clean deter-
gent oil. After removal of the anti-corrosion
oil, bearings should not be left for a long
time because they rust easily.
2) Inspection of shafts and housings
Clean up the shaft and housing to check
whether it has flaws or burrs as a result of
machining.
Be very careful to completely remove lap-
ping agents (SiC, Al2O 3, etc.), casting sands,
and chips from inside the housing.
Next, check that the dimensions, forms,
and finish conditions of the shaft and the
housing are accurate to those specified on
the drawing.
The shaft diameter and housing bore
diameter should de measured at the several
points as shown in Fig. 4-1 and 4-2.
4. Handling of bearings
Fig. 4-2 Measuring points
on housing bore diameter
Furthermore, fillet radius of shaft and
housing, and the squareness of shoulders
should be checked.
When using shaft and housing which have
passed inspection, it is advisable to apply
machine oil to each fitting surface just before
mounting.

Force is necessary to press fit or remove bearings
The force necessary to press fit or remove inner rings of bearings differs depending on the
finish of shafts and how much interference the bearings allow.
The standard values can be obtained by using the following equations.
(Solid shafts) 	Ka = 9.8ƒk ·
∆ deff · B 	1– 	×103 ................................................... (4-1)
(Hollow shafts) 	Ka = 9.8ƒk ·
∆ deff · B –––––––––––––––––– ×103 .................................... (4-2)

Interference fit
of outer rings
Applied to small size bearings
with restricted interference.
Applied to bearings which allow heavy inter-
ference or to large size bearings.
Bearings are fit into housings by cooling
them with dry ice, etc.
In this method, proper rust-preventive
treatment is required, since moisture in the
atmosphere adheres to bearings.
(Table 4-1)
(Table 4-1)
(Table 4-2)
(Table 4-3)
(Table 4-3)
Most widely used method
Mounting procedures depend on the type
and fitting conditions of bearings.
For general bearings in which the shaft
rotates, an interference fit is applied to inner
rings, while a clearance fit is applied to outer
rings.
For bearings in which the outer rings
rotate, an interference fit is applied to the
outer rings.
Interference fitting is roughly classified as
shown here. The detailed mounting process-
es are described in Tables 4-1 to 4-3.

n As shown in the Fig., a bearing should be mounted slowly
with care, by using a fixture to apply force evenly to the
bearing.
When mounting the inner ring, apply pressure to the inner
ring only. Similarly, in mounting the outer ring, press only the
outer ring.
n If interference is required on
both the inner and outer ring
of nonseparable bearings,
use two kinds of fixtures as
shown in the Fig. and apply
force carefully, as rolling ele-
ments are easily damaged.
Be sure never to use a ham-
mer in such cases.

Table 4-2 Shrink fit of cylindrical bore bearings
Shrink fit 	Descriptions
n This method, which expands bearings by heating them in oil,
has the advantage of not applying too much force to bearings
and taking only a short time.
(Notes) • Oil temperature should not be higher than 100˚C, because bearings
heated at higher than 120˚C lose hardness.
• Heating temperature can be determined from the bore diameter of a
bearing and the interference by referring to Fig. 4-3.
• Use nets or a lifting device to prevent the bearing from resting directly on
the bottom of the oil container.
• Since bearings shrink in the radial direction as well as the axial direction
while cooling down, fix the inner ring and shaft shoulder tightly with the
shaft nut before shrinking, so that no space is left between them.
n Shrink fit proves to be clean and effective since, by this method, the ring can be
provided with even heat in a short time using neither fire nor oil.
When electricity is being conducted, the bearing itself generates heat by its
electrical resistance, aided by the built-in exciting coil.
n For cylindrical roller bearings used in roll necks of rolling mills and railway rolling
stock axle journals, where rings are frequently mounted and dismounted, it is
advisable for Koyo special induction heaters (with automatic demagnetizers) to be
used to fit inner rings.

Remarks)
1. Thick solid lines show the maximum
interference value between bearings
(class 0) and shafts (r6, p6, n6, m5, k5,
js5) at normal temperature.
2. Therefore, the heating temperature
should be selected to gain a larger
"expansion of the bore diameter" than
the maximum interference velues.
When fitting class 0 bearings having
a 90 mm bore diameter to m 5
shafts, this figure shows that heating
temperature should be 40˚C higher
than room temperature to produce
expansion larger than the maximum
interference value of 48 μm.
However, taking cooling during
mounting into consideration, the
temperature should be set 20 to
30˚C higher than the temperature
initially required.	Fig. 4-3 Heating temperature and expansion of inner rings

Mounting methods 	Descriptions
q Locknut 	w Hydraulic nut
n When mounting bearings directly on tapered shafts,
provide oil holes and grooves on the shaft and inject
high pressure oil into the space between the fitting
surfaces (oil injection). Such oil injection can reduce
tightening torque of locknut by lessening friction
between the fitting surfaces.
n When exact positioning is required in mounting a
bearing on a shaft with no shoulder, use a clamp to
help determine the position of the bearing.

Locating bearing by use of a clamp
n When mounting bearings on shafts, locknuts are
generally used.
Special spanners are used to tighten them.
Bearings can also be mounted using hydraulic nuts.
n When mounting tapered bore spherical roller bear-
ings, the reduction in the radial internal clearance
which gradually occurs during operation should be
taken into consideration as well as the push-in depth
described in Table 4-4.
Clearance reduction can be measured by a thick-
ness gage. First, stabilize the roller in the proper
position and then insert the gage into the space
between the rollers and the outer ring. Be careful
that the clearance between both roller rows and the
outer rings is roughly the same (e ≈ e’).
Since the clearance may differ at different measuring
points, take measurements at several positions.
n When mounting self-aligning ball bearings, leave
enough clearance to allow easy aligning of the outer
ring.

4-4 	Test run
A trial operation is conducted to insure
that the bearings are properly mounted.
In the case of compact machines, rotation
may be checked by manual operation at first.
If no abnormalities, such as those
described below, are observed, then further
trial operation proceeds using a power
source.
• Knocking ...
due to flaws or insertion of foreign matter
on rolling contact surfaces.
• Excessive torque (heavy) ...
due to friction on sealing devices, too
small clearances, and mounting errors.
• Uneven running torque ...
due to improper mounting and mounting
errors.
For machines too large to allow manual
operation, idle running is performed by turn-
ing off the power source immediately after
turning it on. Before starting power opera-
tion, it must be confirmed that bearings
rotate smoothly without any abnormal vibra-
tion and noise.

Power operation should be started under
no load and at low speed, then the speed is
gradually increased until the designed speed
is reached.
During power operation, check the noise,
increase in temperature and vibration.
If any of the abnormalities listed in Tables
4-5 and 4-6 are found, oparation must be
stopped, and inspection for defects immedi-
ately conducted.
The bearings should be dismounted if
necessary.

inspection.
In general, bearing temperature can be
estimated from housing temperature, but the
most accurate method is to measure the
temperature of outer rings directly via lubri-
cation holes.
Normally, bearing temperature begins to
rise gradually when operation is just starting;
and, unless the bearing has some abnormal-
ity, the temperature stabilizes within one or
two hours.
Therefore, a rapid rise in temperature or
unusually high temperature indicates some
abnormality.

4-5 	Bearing dismounting
After dismounting bearings, handling of
the bearings and the various methods avail-
able for this should be considered.
If the bearing is to be disposed of, any
simple method such as torch cutting can be
employed. If the bearing is to be reused or
checked for the causes of its failure, the
same amount of care as in mounting should
be taken in dismounting so as not to dam-
age the bearing and other parts.
Since bearings with interference fits are
easily damaged during dismounting, mea-
sures to prevent damage during dismounting
must be incorporated into the design.
It is recommended that dismounting
devices be designed and manufactured, if
necessary.
It is useful for discovering the causes of
failures when the conditions of bearings,
including mounting direction and location,
are recorded prior to dismounting.
Dismounting method
Tables 4-7 to 4-9 describe dismounting
methods for interference fit bearings intend-
ed for reuse or for failure analysis.
The force necessary to remove bearings
can be calculated using the equations given
on page A 23.
Table 4-7 Dismounting of cylindrical bore bearings
Inner ring dismounting methods 	Descriptions
n Non-separable bearings should be
treated carefully during dismounting
so as to minimize external force,
which affects their rolling elements.
n The easiest way to remove bearings
is by using a press as shown in
Fig.(a). It is recommended that the
fixture be prepared so that the inner
ring can receive the removal force.
n Figs.(b) and (c) show a dismounting
method in which special tools are
employed. In both cases, the jaws of
the tool should firmly hold the side of
the inner ring.
n Fig.(d) shows an example of removal
by use of an induction heater: this
method can be adapted to both
mounting and dismounting of the
inner rings of NU and NJ type cylin-
drical roller bearings.
The heater can be used for heating
and expanding inner rings in a short
time.

ing by means of feeding high pres-
sure oil to the fitting surfaces.
In both cases, it is recommended that
a stopper (ex. shaft nuts) be provided
to prevent bearings from suddenly
dropping out.
n For bearings with an adapter sleeve,
the following two methods are suit-
able. As shown in Fig.(c), fix bearings
with clamps, loosen locknuts, then
hammer off the adapter sleeve.
This method is mainly used for small
size bearings. Fig.(d) shows the
method using hydraulic nuts.
n Small size bearings with withdrawal
sleeves can be removed by tightening
locknuts as shown in Fig.(e).
For large size bearings, provide sev-
eral bolt holes on locknuts as shown
in Fig.(f), and tighten bolts.
The bearings can then be removed
as easily as small size bearings.

4-6 	Maintenance and inspection
of bearings
Periodic and thorough maintenance and
inspection are indispensable to drawing full
performance from bearings and lengthening
their useful life.
Besides, prevention of accidents and down
time by early detection of failures through
maintenance and inspection greatly con-
tributes to the enhancement of productivity
and profitability.
4-6-1 Cleaning
Before dismounting a bearing for inspec-
tion, record the physical condition of the
bearing, including taking photographs.
Cleaning should be done after checking
the amount of remaining lubricant and col-
lecting lubricant as a sample for examina-
tion.
• A dirty bearing should be cleaned using
two cleaning processes, such as rough
cleaning and finish cleaning.
It is recommended that a net be set on the
bottom of cleaning containers.
• In rough cleaning, use brushes to remove
grease and dirt. Bearings should be han-
dled carefully. Note that raceway surfaces
may be damaged by foreign matter, if bear-
ings are rotated in cleaning oil.
• During finish cleaning, clean bearings care-
fully by rotating them slowly in cleaning oil.
In general, neutral water-free light oil or
kerosene is used to clean bearings, a warm
alkali solution can also be used if necessary.
In any case, it is essential to keep oil clean
by filtering it prior to cleaning.
Apply anti-corrosion oil or rust preventive
grease on bearings immediately after clean-
ing.
4-6-2 	Inspection and analysis
Before determining that dismounted bear-
ings will be reused, the accuracy of their
dimensions and running, internal clearance,
fitting surfaces, raceways, rolling contact sur-
faces, cages and seals must be carefully
examined, so as to confirm that no abnor-
mality is present.
It is desirable for skilled persons who have
sufficient knowledge of bearings to make
decisions on the reuse of bearings.
Criteria for reuse differs according to the
performance and importance of machines
and inspection frequency.
If the following defects are found, replace
the bearing with a new one.
• Cracks and chips in bearing components
• Flaking on the raceway surfaces and the
rolling contact surfaces
• Other failures of a serious degree
4-7 	Methods of analyzing bearing
failures
It is important for enhancing productivity
and profitability, as well as for accident pre-
vention that abnormalities in bearings are
detected during operation.
Representative detection methods are
described in the following section.
1) Noise checking
Since the detection of abnormalities in
bearings from noises requires ample experi-
ence, sufficient training must be given to
inspectors. Given this, it is recommended
that specific persons be assigned to this
work in order to gain this experience.
Attaching hearing aids or listening rods on
housings is effective for detecting bearing
noise.
2) Checking of operating temperature
Since this method utilizes change in oper-
ating temperature, its application is limited to
relatively stable operations.
For detection, operating temperatures
must be continuously recorded.
If abnormalities occur in bearings, operat-
ing temperature not only increase but also
change irregularly.
It is recommended that this method be
employed together with noise checking.
3) Lubricant checking
This method detects abnormalities from
the foreign matter, including dirt and metallic
powder, in lubricants collected as samples.
This method is recommended for inspec-
tion of bearings which cannot be checked by
close visual inspection, and large size bear-
ings.

Deep groove ball bearings
Deep groove ball bearings are available in a variety of
sizes, and are the most popular of all rolling bearings.
This type of bearing supports radial load and a certain
degree of axial load in both directions simultaneously.
n Shielded / sealed type
• Simplifies sealing structure of applications.
• Greasing is not necessary because bearings are
pre-lubricated.
• Table 1 on the next page lists major shielded and
sealed bearing types and compares their perfor-
mance.
n With locating snap ring
• Bearings with a locating snap ring can be fit to the
housing easily, as the locating snap ring facilitates
axial positioning.
n Extra-small ball bearings and miniature ball bearings
• The open type is widely used. Also available are the
shielded / sealed type and the flanged type; the
latter is easily positioned in the axial direction.

Angular contact ball bearings are suitable for applica-
tions which require high accuracy and good high-speed
performance. This type of bearing is designed to carry a
combined load.
n Single-row angular contact ball
bearings and matched pair angular
contact ball bearings
• The standard contact angles are
15˚, 30˚ and 40˚.
They are identified, respectively,
by the supplementary codes "C",
"A" (omitted) and "B". Bearing with a
smaller contact angle are more suitable for applica-
tions involving high-speed rotation.
Those with a larger contact angle feature superior
axial load resistance.
• Angular contact ball bearings are often preloaded to
enhance their rigidity and rotating performance.
For high-precision matched pair angular contact ball
bearings of class 5 or higher, which are used in
machine tools and other precision equipment, the
standard preload is specified in three levels: light (L),
medium (M) and heavy (H).
• When this type of bearing is loaded radially, an axial
component of force is produced. In this case, two
bearings are used together facing one another, or
two or more bearings are matched and used.
• Tables 1 and 2 list the different types of single-row
and matched pair/stack angular contact ball bearings
and describe their characteristics.
n Double-row angular contact ball bearings
Consist of two single-row angular contact ball bearings
matched back-to-back, with inner and outer rings inte-
grated.
Table 3 shows major types and their characteristics.

• Carries radial load and axial load in both directions.
• Suitable for applications involving moment loading because the
distance between the load centers (a) is long.
• As for the preloaded type, the clearance is pre-adjusted so that
bearings will be preloaded the proper amount when the inner ring
is fixed with a nut.
• Carries radial load and axial load in both directions.
• Has a smaller moment load accommodating capacity than the
back-to-back arrangement, because the distance between the load
centers (a) is shorter.
• As for the preloaded type, the clearance is pre-adjusted so that
bearings will be preloaded the proper amount when the outer rings
are pressed together.
• Carries radial load and axial load in one direction.
• Suitable for applications which involve a high degree of axial
loading.

Angular contact ball bearings
Table 1 Single-row angular contact ball bearings
• Single-row angular contact
ball bearings accommodate
radial load and axial load in
one direction.
• Bearings with a machined
cage are suitable for high-
speed applications.
"G-shaped" bearings have a stand-
out between the inner ring and outer
ring on both sides that are equal in
size. This arrangement is called
"flush ground processing".
These bearings can be matched in a
variety of ways.

• As specified in JIS B 1514.
• Koyo has established "special
tolerances" for bore diameter
and outside diameter, as listed
in the table to the right, to make
it easy to produce highprecision
matched stack bearings.
Bearings which are produced
based on these tolerances are
identified by the supplementary
code "K5."

Remark) In angular contact ball bearings, slippage occurs between the balls and raceways under too small a load, causing
smearing to develop.
Matched pair bearings may develop smearing when the ratio of the axial load to the radial load exceeds the value
of e (Fa / Fr > e), as listed in the specification table.
Consult Koyo when these bearings are used under the above conditions.

Notes 1) Rotation speed limits shown above are applicable to machined cage bearings.
Rotation speed limits of pressed cage bearings should be kept to under 80 % of this value.
For bearings with 15˚ contact angle, this figure is applied to the high precision bearings ranked higher than class 5,
used with machined cage or molded cage.
2) B, C or no indication after the bearing number indicates nominal contact angle of 40˚, 15˚ and 30˚ respectively.
Remark) Standard cage types used for the above bearings are described earlier in this section.

Notes 1) Rotation speed limits shown above are applicable to machined cage bearings.
Rotation speed limits of pressed cage bearings should be kept to under 80 % of this value.
For bearings with 15˚ contact angle, this figure is applied to the high precision bearings ranked higher than class 5,
used with machined cage or molded cage.
2) B, C or no indication after the bearing number indicates nominal contact angle of 40˚, 15˚ and 30˚ respectively.
Remark) Standard cage types used for the above bearings are described earlier in this section.

Dynamic equivalent radial load
Pr = XFr + YFa
Static equivalent radial load
P0r = Fr + Y0 Fa
Self-aligning ball bearings have
a spherical outer ring raceway, the
center of whose curvature meets
that of the bearing itself, so that
the inner ring, balls and cage con-
tinue to rotate, aligning them-
selves if they have become mis-
aligned within design limits.
This type of bearing is suitable
when the displacement of the centers around which the
shaft and housing rotate and shaft deflection are likely to
occur.
Bearings with a tapered bore can easily be fit to the
shaft with an adapter assembly.

Cylindrical roller bearings feature high radial load
capacity because the rollers and raceway are in linear
contact. These bearings are suitable for applications that
involve heavy radial and impact loading.
They are also appropriate for high-speed applications
in that they can be machined very accurately due to
their structure.
Having a separable inner ring or outer ring, these
bearings can be mounted and dismounted easily.

• The NU and N types exhibit their best performance
when used as free side bearings since they adjust to
the shaft's axial movement, to a certain extent, relative
to the housing position.
• The NJ and NF types carry axial load in one direction,
while the NUP type can carry a certain degree of axial
load in both directions.

Tolerances of roller set bore diameter Fw and roller set outside diameter Ew of
interchangeable bearings are as follows :
Remark) Interchangeable bearings have an inner ring with rollers that can be matched with
the outer ring, or an outer ring with rollers that can be matched with the inner ring,
without affecting performance.
• Cylindrical bore and tapered bore bearings

• Motor bearings ...... (refer to Table 2-6 on P. A 14.)
• Pressed steel cage (supplementary code : //)
• Copper alloy machined cage
(supplementary code : FY)
Copper alloy machined cages without rivets
(LY) are also used for some special purposes.
Allowable misalignment of single-row cylindrical roller bearings depends on bearing
type and specification.
General values are as follows :
1) When Pr / Cr is approx. 10% under load of normal use
........................ 0.000 6 – 0.000 9 rad (2' – 3')
2) When Pr / Cr is approx. 	6% under load lighter than 1)
........................ 0.001 2 rad (4')
When very large allowable misalignment is required, consult Koyo.
Dynamic equivalent radial load Pr = Fr
Static equivalent radial load P0r = Fr
Cylindrical roller bearings with ribs, including loose rib and thrust coller, on both
inner and outer rings accommodate axial load to a certain extent.
(NJ and NF types accommodate load applied in one direction :
NUP type in both directions.)

Tapered roller bearings are designed such that cup,
cone and rollers have tapered surfaces whose apexes
converge at a common point on the bearing axis.
Along with metric series bearings, inch series bear-
ings are also available.
This type of bearing is suitable for applications that
involve heavy or impact loading.
n Tapered roller bearings
• Able to carry radial and axial load in one direction
simultaneously.
Because an axial component of force is produced
when this type of bearing is loaded radially, two
bearings are used together facing one another, or
two or more bearings are matched and used.
• There are the standard, medium and steep type
which are different in contact angle size.
Medium-tapered metric series bearings are identified
by the supplementary code "C" which is added as a
suffix to bearing numbers.
• Bearings whose cup width, cup small inside diameter
and contact angle are determined in accordance
with ISO 355 specifications are identified by the sup-
plementary code "J" as a suffix.
Cone assemblies and the cups of such bearings are
inter-changeable with those of bearings produced
abroad if the bearing numbers are the same.

Note : When supplementary code "J" is added as a
prefix (not a suffix) to bearing numbers (e.g.
JHM720249/JHM720210), the bearings are not
designed according to ISO 355.
Such bearings are called "J series metric tapered
roller bearings," and are produced according to
special tolerances.

Remarks) 1. When two single-row tapered roller bearings are used together facing one another, an axial component of force
is produced under radial load.
2. When the load is too small, slippage occurs between the rollers and raceways, causing smearing to develop.
This also occurs to matched pair bearings when the ratio of axial load to radial load exceeds the value e shown
in the specification table (Fa / Fr > e).
Consult Koyo on use of bearings under such conditions.

Cylindrical bore Tapered bore
Spherical roller bearings feature a large load rating
capacity and self-aligning capability.
This type of bearing is suitable for low-or medium-
speed applications which involve heavy or impact load-
ing.
• These bearings are divided into R, RR, RH, RHR
and RHA types, which differ in internal structure.
(refer ro Table 1.)
• Each type can be produced with a cylindrical bore or
tapered bore.
Bearing with a tapered bore can be fit and removed
easily using an adapter assembly or withdrawal sleeve.
The rate of taper is equivalent among all bearing
series.

n Spherical roller bearings for shaker screens
• These bearings consist of convex asymmetric rollers
and a prong type, copper alloy, outer ring guided,
machined cage. This cage possesses optimum
characteristics for use with shaker screens.
• The bearings most commonly used with shaker
screens are 223 series spherical roller bearings.
They are identified by the supplementary code
“ROVSW502.” The outer ring outside diameter toler-
ance of these bearings is held to a small allowable
variation.

Remark) 	If the ratio of axial load to radial load exceeds the value e given in the specification table (Fa / Fr > e), slippage
occurs between rollers in rows that are not axial-loaded and the raceway.
This may cause smearing, especially when the bearing is large.
Consult Koyo on the use of bearings under such conditions.

Thrust ball bearings are divided into single and double
direction types. The former is able to accommodate axial
load in one direction, while the latter is able to accom-
modate it in both directions.
Neither is suitable for applications that involve radial
load or high-speed rotation.

Spherical thrust roller bearings are designed to carry
high axial loads. They can also support radial load if
magnitude is no more than 55% of the axial load being
carried.
These bearings are not suitable for high-speed rota-
tion.
Having a spherical housing washer raceway surface,
these bearings are self-alignings, adjusting to axial incli-
nation.
They are usually used with oil lubrication.

Ball bearing units consist of pre-lubricated sealed ball
bearings and a housing which varies in shape.
They are capable of aligning themselves efficiently
using the spherical fitting surface between the bearing
and housing, effectively preventing overloads due to
misalignment.
Koyo ball bearing units are highly accurate and feature
excellent load resistance. They are completely sealed,
and provided with a relubrication feature.
Ball bearing units without a relubrication feature are
also available.

Remarks) 1. Cold-resistant types (D2K2) and heat-resistant types A (D3K2) feature the same level of rotation speed limits
as the standard type.
2. Refer to a separate catalog for details of triple lip sealed bearings, high-speed bearings (K3 and S5) and heat-
resistant bearings (D1K2 and D3K2).
3. When bearings are fit loosely, rotation speed limits should be compensated for by the fitting coefficient given
below.

Bearings are often fit to a shaft with an adapter
sleeve, locknut, lockwasher or lock plate.
These accessories make it easy to attach and remove
bearings.
They are standardized in JIS.
• Locknuts are standardized such that they can be
used with either adapter sleeves, withdrawal sleeves
or shafts.
• Lockwashers and lock plates are used as locks on
locknuts.
Lockwashers are used with bearings of bore diameter
number 40 or lower. Lock plates are used with those of
bore diameter 44 or higher.
