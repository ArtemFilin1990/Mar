Since the introduction of the spherical plain bearing, ELGES spherical
plain bearings and ELGES rod ends have had a decisive influence on
the development and technological progress of these precision
components. This led to extensive product innovations and many
pioneering applications only became possible due to the know-how
of the company group. Furthermore, the new maintenance-free
ELGOGLIDE® bearings – as spherical plain bearings, cylindrical bushes
or combinations of radial, angular contact and axial bearings –
continue the tradition of this product group and at the same time
represent state-of-the-art engineering and economical bearing
solutions.
Spherical plain bearings are ready-to-fit, standardised machine
elements. The concave outer ring bore and the convex inner ring
geometry allow spatial adjustment motion. The bearings can support
static loads and are suitable for tilting and swivel motion. They can
compensate for shaft misalignment, are not subject to edge stresses
under misalignment and allow substantial manufacturing tolerances
in the adjacent construction.
Rod ends are spherical plain bearing units. They comprise a rod type
housing, into which a spherical plain bearing is integrated, and have
an external or internal thread. Rod ends are used as connecting levers
and connecting rods and as connecting elements between cylinders
and their adjacent parts in hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders.
Spherical plain bearings and rod ends are available in numerous
designs, dimension series and versions. The ELGOGLIDE® types are
maintenance-free – the types requiring maintenance are easily
maintained – and extremely reliable in operation and have a long
operating life.
Catalogue 238 describes the range of ELGES spherical plain bearings
and ELGES rod ends. It has been completely revised from
Catalogue 236. Any information in previous editions which does not
concur with the data in this edition is therefore invalid. The principal
changes relate to the maintenance-free sliding material ELGOGLIDE®.
These are:
■ increased basic load ratings
■ extended sliding travel.
This gives a significant increase in bearing life.
In addition to the catalogue, the INA CD medias® professional
represents a further service. This CD is designed as an advisory
system. It contains an information section giving detailed product
descriptions, selected application examples with design guidelines,
calculation software and a lexicon of terminology relevant to rolling
bearing technology. Please contact INA for a copy of this CD.

Ordering designation
The ordering designation gives an abbreviated description of
the product.
It consists of:
■ the designation and
■ suffixes.
Marking on the product
Do not use the marking on the bearing for ordering. It may be
incomplete or not sufficiently specific.
Designation (Figure 1 and 2)
Every product has a designation. This is given in the dimension
tables and describes the standard design of the bearing.
The designation consists of several parts.
It indicates:
■ the design – the type of product
(spherical plain bearing, rod end, plain bush)
■ the dimensional component – the bore diameter
■ the type of sliding contact surface.
Product index, see page 8.
Suffixes (Figure 1 and 2)
The suffixes are placed after the designation.
They supplement the designation and indicate:
■ variants on the standard design,
e.g. lip seals on both sides 2RS
■ special designs.
Special designs are possible only by agreement.
Index of suffixes, see page 13.
Ordering the product (Figure 1 and 2)
Ordering procedure:
■ determine the product type required
■ take the ordering designation from the dimension table.
The correct sequence of characters must be observed
when ordering.
Further ordering examples are given in the product sections.

Load carrying capacity and life
Spherical plain bearings and rod ends
The size of spherical plain bearing or rod end required depends
on the requirements for:
■ load carrying capacity
■ motion
■ rating life
■ operational reliability.
The direction and type of load determine:
■ the bearing type
■ the sliding contact surface.
The load carrying capacity is measured in terms of:
■ the basic dynamic load rating Cr (Ca ) (page 20)
■ the basic static load rating C 0r (C0a) (page 21).
Cylindrical plain bushes
The principal factors influencing the dimensioning of
cylindrical plain bushes and their life calculation include:
■ the magnitude and type of load
■ the motion of the bearing
■ the frequency of motion
■ the load frequency under pulsating or alternating load.
The load carrying capacity is measured in terms of:
■ the basic dynamic load rating Cr (page 20)
■ the basic static load rating C 0r (page 21).
Concentric constant load F
Load values can be used directly in the life calculation if
they meet the following criteria:
■ they act in a radial direction only on radial spherical plain
bearings, angular contact spherical plain bearings
and cylindrical plain bushes (Figure 1 and Figure 2)
■ they act in a concentric, axial direction only on axial spherical
plain bearings (Figure 3)
■ their magnitude and direction does not change during
operation.
In this case, the load value F for life calculation is identical to
the calculation value P (F = P).

Load carrying capacity and life
Basic load ratings
Contact pressure
The load carrying capacity is measured in terms of the basic
static and dynamic load ratings.
Basic load ratings are always defined by the manufacturer of
the bearings. They cannot therefore be compared in a simplistic
manner with data from other manufacturers.
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating Cr (Ca) is a parameter for
calculating the life of:
■ spherical plain bearings, rod ends and plain bushes under
dynamic loads.
It is dependent on the sliding contact surface and has
a significant influence on the life of spherical plain bearings,
rod ends and plain bushes.
Dynamic load
A spherical plain bearing, plain bush or rod end is subject to
dynamic load if, under load
■ it undergoes swivelling, tilting or rotary motion.
Any relative motion between the sliding surfaces, even if
superimposed on the main motion, increases wear and causes
material fatigue.
It must always be:
■ allocated to the dynamic load case
■ taken into consideration in the life calculation.
Calculation of basic dynamic load rating
The contact pressures actually occurring in a spherical plain
bearing or a plain bush are dependent on:
■ the load
■ the sliding contact surface
■ the osculation conditions
■ the installation situation.
Due to the influence of these factors, it is not possible to
determine the pressures precisely. The basic dynamic load
ratings (dimension table) therefore include (Table 1):
■ a load parameter K specific to the material
■ the projected load-bearing area.
The basic load rating C is the maximum permissible
dynamic load. The basic load ratings can only be fully
utilised if the load:
– acts in a radial direction only on radial and angular
contact spherical plain bearings, rod ends and
plain bushes
– acts in a concentric, axial direction only on
axial spherical plain bearings.

Basic static load rating
The basic static load rating C0r (C0a) is used if spherical plain
bearings, plain bushes and rod ends
■ are subjected to load while stationary.
It indicates the load that a spherical plain bearing, plain bush or
rod end can support at room temperature without damage
to the sliding surfaces. This is subject to the precondition that
the components adjacent to the bearing must prevent
deformation of the bearing.
If the basic static load rating C0r (C0a ) is used to the full,
the shaft and housing must be made from high-strength
materials.
Rod ends
In this case, the basic static load rating C 0r indicates the load
carrying capacity of the rod end housing under static tensile
load. At room temperature, the basic static load rating includes
a safety factor of at least 1,2 in relation to the yield point of
the housing material.
The permissible load on rod ends is lower for pulsating or
alternating loads.
Calculation of rod ends requiring maintenance using load
factors fb : see Table 1, page 146;
calculation of maintenance-free rod ends using load
factors fb : see Table 1, page 128.
Contact pressure
If the required life is to be achieved, the specific bearing load
must be matched to the actual operating conditions.
The specific bearing load indicates the contact pressure in
the bearing. It is the decisive criterion for assessing
the suitability of a plain bearing in the particular application.
Under extreme loading conditions, for example a high axial load
acting on radial spherical plain bearings, elastic deformation
of the bearing and housing may lead to contact pressure
concentrations. Please consult INA for further information.
The contact pressure p of a spherical plain bearing is calculated
from:
■ the basic dynamic load rating C r (C a)
■ the specific material parameter K
■ the equivalent bearing load P.

Load carrying capacity and life
Predimensioning
If the basic dynamic load rating Cr (Ca ) is used to the full,
this often leads to a severe reduction in the operating life of
bearings with metallic sliding surfaces. The degree to which
the basic load rating is utilised should therefore always be
matched to the required operating life.
This is indicated by:
■ the ratio Cr (C a)/P.
The ratio Cr (C a)/P must be not less than 1. Depending on
the application and bearing type, it is between 1 and 10.
For the purposes of predimensioning, values are stated for
the ratio Cr (C a)/P (Table 2 and Table 3). In conjunction with
the diagram, this allows preliminary selection of the appropriate
bearing size (Figure 10).
Predimensioning is not a substitute for more extensive
bearing calculation.

Load carrying capacity and life
Bearing motion
Rating life
Spherical plain bearings are principally intended to support
high loads under oscillating motion.
The term “bearing motion” describes the dynamic conditions in
the bearing.
These are essentially characterised by:
■ the magnitude of the motion
■ the speed of the motion
■ the frequency of the motion.
Motion parameter – swivel angle and tilt angle
Swivel motion is defined as the oscillating motion of
the two bearing rings in relation to each other about the axis of
the bearing.
Swivel angle
The centring angle described by the two extreme points of
the motion is defined as the swivel angle  (Figure 11).
This describes the motion between the two extreme points.
Tilt angle
In tilting motion, the inner ring or shaft locating washer moves
relative to the outer ring or housing locating washer in
a direction transverse to the bearing axis. The axes of
the relevant bearing rings intersect at the tilt angle  (Figure 12).
The permissible tilt angle  is given in the dimension tables,
based on full utilisation of the basic load ratings.
Combined swivel and tilt motion
The motion angle 1 corresponding to the sliding distance can
be calculated for linear and ellipsoid motion (Figure 13).

25
Rotary motion
The sliding distance covered in a motion cycle – motion from
the start point to the return point and back – corresponds to
twice the arc length of the angle  or . For this reason,
an angle  = 180° should be used for rotary motion in life
calculation.
Frequency of motion
The number of motions per time period – the frequency –
has a significant influence on the life of spherical plain bearings
and cylindrical plain bushes.
The frictional energy generated in the bearing is influenced by
the frequency of motion as well as the load, coefficient of friction
and the magnitude of the motion. It is dependent on
the relevant sliding contact surface and must not exceed
the permissible p · v values.
The frequency can only be used for calculating the mean
sliding speed in applications with continuous operation or
periodic stationary periods.
Intermittent operation
In this case, the mean sliding speed during one motion cycle
must be used.
Life
Calculation of the theoretical life is based on a large number of
laboratory tests and assumes certain operational data:
■ lithium soap multi-purpose greases with solid additives are
used in spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel sliding
contact surface.
The life is defined as the number of swivel motions or operating
hours that can be achieved by a sufficiently large number of
spherical plain bearings or cylindrical plain bushes under
identical operating conditions before certain failure criteria are
met.
The failure criteria are defined by the manufacturer as test limit
values related to:
■ an amount of wear dependent on the bearing size
or
■ an upper friction limit which is exceeded.
The amount of wear and increase in friction are dependent on
the sliding contact surface and the application. Under identical
operating conditions, the operating life achieved may therefore
differ significantly.
Calculation of the theoretical life gives comparative values for
the bearings. They can be used to assess the greater or lesser
performance of the bearings selected.
Life calculation:
■ Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
(page 63 to 71)
■ Maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
(page 72, 73)
■ Maintenance-free rod ends
(page 63 to 71 and 128, 129)
■ Spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance
(page 97 to 99)
■ Rod ends requiring maintenance
(page 97 to 99 and 146 to 148).
Operating life
The operating life is the number of motion cycles or operating
hours achieved in practice by a spherical plain bearing or
a cylindrical plain bush. It may differ from the calculated
theoretical life.
The operating life is dependent on factors including:
■ the type and magnitude of load
■ any shocks occurring
■ the sealing arrangement
■ corrosion
■ contamination
■ maintenance.
Calculation service
The influences that must be taken into consideration in
calculation are expressed as mathematical functions.
As a result, the calculation principles can be programmed,
eliminating the need for time-consuming manual calculation
work.
Calculation programs are available which may be used on
request.
The theoretical life calculations are valid for the products
described in this catalogue.
Under no circumstances can they be transferred to other
products.

Friction
Friction is principally dependent on:
■ the sliding contact surface
■ the load
■ the sliding speed
■ the bearing temperature
■ the lubrication condition
■ the quality of the sliding surfaces.
Friction behaviour of spherical plain bearings requiring
maintenance, maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
and maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
The friction behaviour changes during the operating life.
The lowest friction values are found with bearings that are well
run in. The values are significantly higher during the running-in
and failure phases.
For safety reasons, the maximum values should always
be used for calculating the drive power (Table 1).
If the friction value exceeds the maximum value, this may have
the following consequences:
■ wear may increase
■ the bearing temperature may rise
■ the function of the bearing may be impaired.
Bearing frictional torque
The bearing frictional torque M (from the formula) is valid for
(Figure 1):
■ radial and angular contact spherical plain bearings under
radial load
■ axial spherical plain bearings under axial load.
If the bearing is subjected to combined load (radial and
axial), the bearing frictional torque is calculated by
integration of the standard loads.

Friction behaviour of maintenance-free plain bearing
materials based on PTFE
Figure 2 shows the friction factor  as a function of:
■ the sliding speed
■ the load
■ the temperature.
With new spherical plain bearings, the bearing frictional torque
may be significantly higher during the early running-in phase
due to:
■ plastic transfer of the PTFE material to the surface structure
of the opposing running surface
■ the incomplete internal bearing tribology and the deposit
of PTFE particles on the opposing running surface/
functional surface (PTFE/PTFE friction).
The wear behaviour of maintenance-free spherical plain
bearings and plain bushes is shown in Figure 3.

Lubrication
Spherical plain bearings and rod ends with a steel/steel
sliding contact surface requiring maintenance are given
a special surface treatment and are provided with MoS2 .
However, the function and wear of spherical plain bearings and
rod ends is heavily influenced by the quality of maintenance.
Functions of the lubricant
The lubricant should (Figure 1):
■ reduce friction
■ prevent corrosion
■ form a lubricant film which is capable of supporting loads
between the contact points
■ if grease lubrication is used, protect the bearing against
contamination and moisture.
Criteria for lubricant selection
The following must be taken into consideration:
■ the load
■ the load direction
■ the swivel angle
■ the sliding speed
■ the ambient temperature
■ the environmental conditions.
It is more important to use a suitable lubricant than to
provide generously defined, short lubrication intervals.
The lubricant must always be chosen in consultation with
the lubricant manufacturer.
Grease lubrication
Steel/steel sliding contact surface
The following are suitable for standard applications:
■ conventional, corrosion-inhibiting, high-pressure greases
with a lithium soap base, EP additives and solid lubricant
additives.
Suitable lubricants contain:
■ approx. 3% MoS2 or
■ solid additives based on calcium and zinc phosphate
compounds.
– Even under high contact pressure, these additives
separate the sliding surfaces from each other.
Steel/bronze sliding contact surface
The following are suitable:
■ conventional, corrosion-inhibiting, water-repellent lithium
soap greases of normal consistency.
Lubricating greases with MoS2 additives or other solid
lubricants must not be used.

Running-in phase
The running-in phase has a significant influence on the later
wear behaviour of the bearing. Correct lubrication is of
particular importance at this point.
During running-in
■ the surfaces of the contact zones are smoothed
■ the contact zones are elastically bedded in.
This increases the contact area and reduces the load on
the material.
Greasing
During the running-in phase, the pressure in the bearing is
particularly high. Spherical plain bearings are therefore
manganese phosphated and treated with MoS2.
The wear occurring during the running-in phase proceeds
all the more favourably the more MoS2 is embedded in the
porous-crystalline manganese phosphate. This process is at its
most effective if the bearing:
■ is subjected to about ten swivel motions under load without
additional greasing
■ is then provided with an initial greasing.
If this is not possible, the initial greasing must be metered
carefully in order to avoid flushing an excessive quantity of
MoS 2 out of the bearing.
Relubrication
During relubrication, old grease is replaced by fresh grease.
At the same time, the grease flushes wear debris and
contaminants out of the bearing.
Bearings with steel/steel sliding contact surfaces must be
periodically relubricated.
The relubrication intervals should not be established
arbitrarily but determined by calculation or in consultation
with the lubricant manufacturer.
If relubrication is carried out too frequently, the operating
life of the bearing may be reduced, since the friction of
spherical plain bearings always increases for a short time
after relubrication.
Preconditions
■ the grease should be the same as that used for initial
greasing
– if different greases are used, their miscibility and
compatibility should be checked
■ relubrication should be carried out
– with the bearing still warm from operation
– before the bearing comes to rest if safe to do so
– before extended breaks in operation.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings,
plain bushes and rod ends
During the running-in phase, PTFE particles are transferred
from the outer ring sliding layer to the opposing running surface
of the inner ring. This fills in the areas of slight roughness in
the inner ring surface. A long operating life is only achieved with
this tribologically smooth surface.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings, plain bushes
and rod ends must not be relubricated.
The PTFE particles to be transferred do not adhere to
oily surfaces. Lubricant therefore prevents the necessary
smoothing of the surface.
If spherical plain bearings, plain bushes and rod ends that
have been subjected to dry running-in are subsequently
lubricated, this damages the smoothing effect previously
achieved.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings, plain bushes and
rods ends do not have any facilities for relubrication.

Internal clearance
and operating clearance
Internal clearance
Radial internal clearance
Radial internal clearance of radial spherical plain bearings
requiring maintenance with steel/steel sliding contact
surface
The radial internal clearance is defined as the distance by which
the inner ring can be moved in a radial direction relative to
the outer ring from one extreme position to the other (Figure 1).
The radial internal clearance is divided into three groups
(Table 1 and Table 2) and is given in the dimension tables.
This assumes that the bearing is mounted in a housing bore
that, apart from the correction of geometrical inaccuracies,
causes no dimensional changes in the bearing.
Normal internal clearance
The normal internal clearance gives an optimum operating
clearance under normal operating conditions if the
recommended fits (see Design of bearing arrangements,
Seite 37) are used.
Radial internal clearance larger or smaller than normal
In order to meet the requirements arising from different
operating or installation conditions, the bearings are also
available with (Table 1 and Table 2):
■ internal clearance larger than normal
– where tight fits are used or there are large temperature
differences between the inner and outer ring
■ internal clearance smaller than normal
– for bearing arrangements with very small clearance.
Suffixes
Spherical plain bearings with normal internal clearance do not
have a suffix.
Bearings with a radial internal clearance C2 and C3 differ from
the standard design. They are ordered using a suffix.
Example
Spherical plain bearing GE 60 DO with reduced internal
clearance: GE 60 DO-C2.
Axial internal clearance
The axial internal clearance is defined as the amount by which
the inner ring can be moved in an axial direction relative to
the outer ring from one extreme position to the other (Figure 2).
It is dependent on the bearing geometry and is in a direct
relationship to the radial internal clearance. Depending on
the bearing type, it may be several times greater than the radial
internal clearance.

Internal clearance
and operating clearance
Internal clearance
Internal clearance of cylindrical plain bushes
Bearings requiring maintenance must have a minimum radial
internal clearance for lubrication. Maintenance-free cylindrical
plain bushes have an integral solid lubricant supply. They do not
therefore require this minimum radial clearance for lubrication
purposes.
Fitting without clearance has particular advantages, especially
with alternating load directions. Load distribution is also
improved, especially during running-in, due to the larger
load-bearing areas.
In order to achieve the largest possible load-bearing angle,
the operating clearance S must not exceed defined limits.
The clearance can be expressed as a function of the relative
internal clearance  (Figure 3 and formula).
For bore diameters d = 30 mm to 200 mm, guide values are
given in Table 3.
These ranges can be used:
■ due to the standard tolerances of the plain bushes and
■ if the housing bore and shaft are manufactured to
the “average tolerance”.

Internal clearance
and operating clearance
Operating clearance
The operating clearance is determined on a fitted bearing still
warm from operation.
It is calculated from:
■ the radial internal clearance (Table 2, page 31)
■ the change in the radial internal clearance due to
interference and temperature influences in a fitted bearing.
Influence of interference on the radial internal clearance
of radial spherical plain bearings
The radial internal clearance changes due to the fit as a result
of:
■ expansion of the inner ring
■ contraction of the outer ring.

Design of bearing arrangements
Radial location of spherical plain bearings
and maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
In spherical plain bearings, sliding motion should occur
between the spherical sliding surfaces of the inner and outer
rings – the quality and treatment of the surfaces are matched
to this purpose. The internal clearance and osculation of the
sliding surfaces must therefore be in a balanced relationship.
Spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance
The operating life of spherical plain bearings requiring
maintenance is reduced by:
■ preload on the sliding surfaces
■ excessively small load-bearing areas on the sliding surfaces
due to unacceptably large internal clearance.
The recommended fits are given in Table 1).
If tighter fits are required, for example due to high impact-
type loads, the operating clearance must be checked
by calculation (see Influence of interference on the radial
internal clearance, page 34).
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
Looser fits may be used with maintenance-free bearings:
■ due to the hard chromium/PTFE sliding contact surface,
friction is lower than with steel/steel sliding contact surfaces.
The recommended fits are given in Table 2.
Application as locating bearings
The shaft and bore fits must be selected such that no sliding
motion occurs on the shaft or in the bore.
■ Tight fits prevent damage to the adjacent construction.
When using tight fits, however, it must be noted that:
■ interference between the housing and outer ring
causes contraction of the outer ring
■ interference between the shaft and bearing bore
causes expansion of the inner ring.
These elastic deformations of the bearing rings reduce
the internal clearance of the bearing (see Influence of
interference on the radial internal clearance, page 34).
If a tight fit is not possible, the bearing rings must be secured
against axial sliding motion on the shaft or in the housing
(Axial location, page 38).
Application as non-locating bearings
(between shaft and bearing bore)
The surface of the shaft must be wear-resistant as follows:
■ surface hardness  56 HRC
■ maximum surface roughness Rz10.
Spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance should then
only be lubricated via the shaft. Maintenance-free spherical
plain bearings can have a lining of sliding material ELGOGLIDE®
in the inner ring bore, suffix W7, W8 (page 13).

Design of bearing arrangements
Axial location of spherical plain bearings
Spherical plain bearings under high load undergo elastic
deformation. This leads to relative micromovements on
the seating surfaces. As a result, the bearing rings can creep in
an axial direction despite a tight fit.
In order to prevent axial displacement, the bearing ring
must always be located axially.
Non-locating bearing side
The axial displacement should occur between the shaft and
bearing bore because:
■ the length/diameter ratio of the guidance is more favourable
at this point than on the outer ring of the bearing
■ the axially split outer ring expands under axial load and
can therefore jam in the bearing location
■ no wear should in general occur in the housing bore.
Location of bearing rings
The following are suitable for location (Figure 1, 2 and 3):
■ retaining rings
– the bearings can thus be easily fitted and dismantled
■ spacers between the bearing ring and adjacent construction
if:
– the shaft must not be weakened by the use of annular
grooves
– the bearings are to be axially preloaded – this prevents
rotary motion between the bearing ring and adjacent
construction even with a loose fit.

Design of bearing arrangements
Design of adjacent components
Chamfer dimensions
Spherical plain bearings have a convex transition between
the outside surface and bore to the end faces. This makes
fitting of the bearing easier.
The bearing rings must be in contact with the shaft and
housing shoulders. The largest radius of the shaft/housing
locating face must therefore not be larger than the smallest
chamfer dimension r 1s /r 2s of the spherical plain bearing
(Figure 4 and dimension table).
Quality of shaft and housing bore
The seating surfaces of the bearing should be such that
the loads transmitted through the bearing:
■ do not cause unacceptable geometrical deviations of
the shaft and housing
■ do not cause permanent deformation of the spherical plain
bearing.
In the case of highly loaded spherical plain bearings with
p  80 N/mm2 , the shaft and housing must be checked.
The geometrical accuracy of the seating surfaces should be
within the tolerance ranges of the recommended fit.
The recommended surface quality values are given in
Table 3 and 4. If larger roughness values are present,
please consult INA.

Maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
Suitable seals are shown in Table 1.
During the operating life, the operating clearance may increase
– under high alternating loads, this may be by 0,5 mm to
0,8 mm. Furthermore, the plain bushes are not relubricated.
These points must be taken into consideration in the design
of the seal and seal environment – the suitability of the seal must
be agreed with the seal manufacturer.

Fitting and dismantling
Fitting
Spherical plain bearings, rod ends and cylindrical plain bushes
are high precision machine elements. They must be handled
very carefully both before and during fitting. Problem-free
functioning is substantially dependent on the care taken in
fitting.
Bearing failures will lead to:
■ machine downtime
■ expensive repairs.
If bearings are fitted incorrectly, no liability can be
accepted.
Spherical plain bearings, rod ends and cylindrical plain bushes
should only be fitted by personnel with sufficient and
appropriate training. In case of doubt, please consult INA.
Delivered condition
Spherical plain bearings and cylindrical plain bushes are
supplied with the surfaces (except the bore) protected by
a preservative. Depending on their design, rod ends are
supplied protected by a preservative or with a zinc plating.
Any change, irrespective of the bearing type,
will reduce the operating life of the bearing.
Bearings must not be treated or cleaned using
trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, petroleum spirit or
other solvents.
Substances containing oil will change the characteristics
of the bearing.
Storage
Bearings should only be stored:
■ in the original packaging
■ in dry, clean rooms with the temperature as constant
as possible
■ at a relative humidity of max. 65%.
Removal from packaging
Perspiration from handling leads to corrosion. Hands should be
kept clean and dry and gloves worn if necessary.
Spherical plain bearings, rod ends and cylindrical plain bushes
should only be removed from their original packaging
immediately before fitting.
If the original packaging is damaged, the products must be
checked.
If the products are contaminated, they must be wiped with
a clean cloth only.

Tools for heat assisted fitting
In order to reduce the forces required for fitting, the spherical
plain bearings can be heated:
■ avoid localised overheating. The bearing temperature must
be monitored using a thermometer
■ information in the INA catalogue and manufacturer’s data
on grease and seals must be observed.
Suitable devices for heating include:
■ heating cabinets with a controllable thermostat
■ the induction heater INAtherm® (Figure 1).
These have the following advantages:
– uniform heating
– no contamination of the components
– long preheating periods are not required.
Checking the adjacent construction (Figure 2)
■ Quality of bearing seating surfaces
– shaft and housing bore
■ Dimensional and geometrical accuracy of seating and
locating faces
■ Shaft and housing seating
■ Lead chamfer on shaft/housing bore between 10° and 20°
■ Any burrs must be removed
■ If tight fits are used or the fitting conditions present difficulties
– the surfaces of the shaft and housing bore should be
lightly oiled.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings and
maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes should be fitted
such that no lubricant or other substances used to aid
fitting can reach the sliding surfaces.

Fitting and dismantling
Fitting
Rules and guidelines
The information given must be adhered to.
If it is not, there is a direct or indirect hazard to personnel,
the product and/or the adjacent construction.
■ The assembly area must be kept clean and free from dust.
■ The bearings must be protected against moisture and
aggressive media.
■ The bearings must always be located concentrically.
Mechanical and thermal assistance
■ Direct blows using a hammer and drift on the end faces
of the bearing rings must be avoided
– incorrect handling can damage the bearing and lead
to microcracks in the bearing.
■ Fitting forces must always be applied to the inner ring
(Figure 3)
– if these forces are directed through the sliding surfaces,
the bearings may jam during fitting.
■ If radial spherical plain bearings are fitted on the shaft and in
a housing at the same time, fitting tools must be used which
act simultaneously on the end faces of the inner and outer
ring (Figure 4).
■ Larger bearings must be fitted using special fitting
equipment (Figure 5)
– the fitting forces required increase with the diameter.
Simple impact type tools are no longer sufficient in these
cases.
Thermal assistance
■ Spherical plain bearings must not be heated above +130 °C
– higher temperatures damage the seals
■ Spherical plain bearings must not be heated in an oil bath
– this impairs the tribological system of maintenance-free
bearings
– it changes the molybdenum disulphide concentration on
the sliding surfaces in bearings with a steel/steel sliding
contact surface
■ Bearings must not be heated using a naked flame
– the material undergoes excessive localised heating and its
hardness is reduced. Furthermore, stresses are induced in
the bearing
– the seals could melt
– maintenance-free sliding surfaces could be damaged.

Fitting by refrigeration
The inner rings of radial spherical plain bearings with
a steel/steel sliding contact surface undergo structural change
at temperatures below –61 °C. This may cause a volume
increase. Due to the change in the tolerances, the bearing may
then jam
■ if this fitting method is to be used, the bearing rings can
be supplied with appropriate heat treatment. Please consult
INA in this case.
For easier fitting, maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes can
be cooled in liquid nitrogen (–196 °C) for short periods.
In the case of plain bushes with integral seals (2RS versions),
the correct seating of the seals in the undercut must be
checked after refrigeration.
Adhesive bonding of bearing rings
If the recommended fits are adhered to, it is not necessary to
use adhesive on the bearing rings.
Adhesives may only be used on spherical plain bearings with
steel/steel sliding contact surfaces under the following
conditions:
■ the surfaces to be bonded must be clean and free from
grease
■ the raceways must be cleaned using a cleaning agent and
well lubricated using a paste with a high MoS2 content
■ it must be checked that the lubricant ducts and lubricant
holes are not blocked by adhesive.
Main load direction
In radial spherical plain bearings with split outer rings, the joints
are offset at 90° from the main load direction (Figure 6)
■ the lubrication holes of bearings requiring maintenance are
thus positioned in the load zone. This allows good lubricant
distribution in the load zone area.
Transporting the bearings (Figure 7)
Large spherical plain bearings must only be transported using
the eye bolts supplied. Radial bearings have threaded holes on
the end faces of the inner and outer rings, large axial spherical
plain bearings have threaded holes on the end faces of the shaft
and housing locating washers.
Welding currents
If welding work is carried out on the adjacent
construction, welding currents must not be allowed to
pass through the spherical plain bearing, since this will
immediately damage the sliding surfaces.
Figure 6 · Joint, main load direction, lubrication holes
Figure 7 · Transporting large radial spherical plain bearings
Fitting orientation for GE..DW, GE..DW-2RS2
During fitting, it must be ensured that the screw connection on
one side of the outer ring halves is facing towards the open side
of the bearing. This makes subsequent dismantling easier.

Fitting and dismantling
Dismantling
Even if the load is applied to the ring to be dismantled in
accordance with the specification, the frictional contact of
the other ring due to the fit presents difficulties in dismantling
(Figure 8).
Depending on the level of interference, the inner ring will
contract and the outer ring will expand. The extraction forces
also increase with increasing interference.
If the following precautions are taken during design,
this will make dismantling of the bearings easier:
■ a threaded hole for an extraction screw in the shaft
(Figure 9)
■ threaded holes for extraction screws in the housing
(Figure 10)
■ milled areas on the stud for the jaws of the extraction device
(Figure 10). Figure 8 · Contraction of the inner ring and expansion of
the outer ring

Operating temperatures
The permissible operating temperature is dependent on:
■ the sliding contact surface
■ the sealing arrangement.
If the operating temperature exceeds the values in
Table 1, this will reduce:
– the life of the bearing
– the efficacy of the sealing arrangement.
If sealed bearings must be used at high temperatures,
an unsealed bearing with external heat-resistant seals can
be used (Figure 1).
The influence of temperature on life is taken into consideration
by means of temperature factors.

Materials
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings have special sliding
layers based on PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene).
In descending order of performance, these are:
■ ELGOGLIDE® –
the highest performance sliding layer (Figure 1)
■ PTFE-bronze film (Figure 2)
■ PTFE composite (Figure 3)
These materials form the slideway of the outer ring.
They transmit loads and provide lubrication – the bearings must
not be lubricated by any other means.
Features of ELGOGLIDE®
The sliding layer comprises a 0,5 mm thick layer of E LGOGLIDE®,
is embedded in resin and fixed to the bush by a high strength
bond. The flow behaviour of the sliding layer is, in combination
with the bush, almost negligible even under very high load.
The bond is resistant to moisture and swelling.

Materials
Spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance
These spherical plain bearings are made from high quality rolling
bearing steel. Depending on the bearing size, the raw materials
are in the form of tubes, forgings or rolled parts.
The sliding contact surface is:
■ steel/steel or steel/bronze.
The steel bearing rings are turned, hardened, ground on all
sides and surface treated.
The surface treatment – manganese phosphating with
subsequent molybdenum disulphide coating of the sliding
surfaces – gives excellent wear resistance. The effective
separation of the metallic surfaces gives optimum running-in
characteristics.

Design and safety guidelines
Note the ratio Cr (Ca)/P (Predimensioning, page 22 and
Table 1). The permissible ratio is decisively dependent on
the operating conditions, lubricant and the required
operating life.
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings are, depending
on type, only suitable for alternating dynamic loads in
certain cases (Table 1).
The parts of different bearings are not interchangeable with
each other.
Angular contact spherical plain bearings
If angular contact spherical plain bearings are to transmit axial
and radial loads, the bearings can be installed in pairs
in an O or X arrangement (Figure 1).

Axial spherical plain bearings
If axial spherical plain bearings are to be combined with radial
spherical plain bearings of dimension series E to ISO 12 240-1
in order to support radial loads, the axial and radial load must
be distributed over both bearings.
In order to achieve this:
■ the pin must have a radial release of approx. 1 mm in
the shaft locating washer (Figure 2) or
■ the pin must only be in contact with the large end surface
of the shaft locating washer (Figure 2).
From a bore diameter of 160 mm, the bearing must
be fitted in a closed housing. The diameter D of the axial
bearing corresponds to the inside diameter of
the housing.

radial spherical plain bearing

Maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
Maintenance-free cylindrical plain bushes
Do not lubricate the sliding layer. Lubricant increases
wear and considerably reduces the operating life of
the bearing.
Plain bushes should not be used for movement involving
spatial alignment. Any skewing of the shaft reduces
the bearing life.
For applications involving contact with water, plain bushes with
a corrosion-resistant steel bush must be used. The “flushing
effect” will considerably increase wear of the sliding layer.
If movement is infrequent, however, the operating life may
nevertheless be sufficient. The design of the plain bush and
its suitability should be agreed with INA first.
If plain bushes come into contact with chemical media,
special measures will often be required for the bush material or
the surface treatment. The design of the plain bush and its
suitability should be agreed with INA first.
Design of bearing arrangements
The shaft and housing bore should conform to Figure 3.
■ For optimum conditions, the shaft should be hardened and
hard chromium plated or corrosion-resistant steel should be
used.
■ The shaft roughness should not exceed Rz1 if possible.
Higher roughness values will reduce the operating life of plain
bushes. Roughness values  Rz4 should be avoided.
If plain bushes are combined with outer seals, it must be taken
into consideration when designing the sealing arrangement
that:
■ the internal clearance will increase due to wear of the sliding
layer
■ the plain bush cannot be relubricated.
Fitting
Plain bushes should be pressed in using a fitting arbor
(Figure 5).
The chamfer of the fitting arbor must have rounded corners or
ends:
■ dD = d – (0,3 mm to 0,5 mm).
Sharp corners on the entry side of the shaft and arbor will
damage the sliding layer and reduce the operating life of
the plain bush.

Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings
Radial spherical plain bearings
Angular contact spherical plain bearings
Axial spherical plain bearings
Calculation of rating life
In maintenance-free spherical plain bearings, the sliding
surfaces are in direct contact due to the lack of lubricant.
This leads to wear. Wear of the sliding surface is therefore
the principal failure criterion in life calculation.
Due to wear, the friction increases towards the end of
the operating life.
In some cases, low sliding speeds and low bearing loads can
result in very high calculated life values. With very long
running times, however, parameters that are not taken into
consideration in calculation can have a considerable influence
on the life; these include:
■ vibration
■ contamination
■ moisture
■ corrosion
■ ageing.
The actual life may therefore differ considerably from these
values.
The operating life of large spherical plain bearings of
series GE..DW and GE..DW-2RS2 cannot be determined
using the calculation method presented here – particular
attention must be paid to the specific environmental
conditions in each application. Please consult INA in this
case.
In the case of axial bearings with d  220 mm, particular
attention must be paid to the surrounding constructions
and operating conditions. Please consult INA in this case.

Features
Radial spherical plain bearings
■ are complete units comprising inner rings and outer rings
with a steel/steel or steel/bronze sliding contact surface
– the inner ring has a cylindrical bore and a convex
outer slideway
– the outer ring has a cylindrical outside surface and
concave inner slideway.
From d = 320 mm, the outer ring is split at two points
and held together by retaining rings
– in series GE..PB, the outer ring is made from bronze
■ can support radial loads
■ can transmit motion and loads with low moment levels
– they can thus keep bending stresses away from
the adjacent structure
■ are particularly suitable for alternating loads with impact
type and shock type stresses
■ can support axial loads in both directions
■ are lubricated via the outer and inner ring
– with exceptions (dimensions)
– under alternating load, one side is relieved.
This zone is lubricated as a result of the swivel motion.
Sealed radial spherical plain bearings requiring
maintenance
■ are protected against contaminants and water spray by
– lip seals.

Features
Angular contact spherical plain bearings
■ are complete units comprising an inner ring and
an outer ring with a steel/steel sliding contact surface
– the inner ring has a convex outer slideway
– the outer ring has a concave inner slideway
■ can support axial loads as well as radial loads
– they are thus suitable for alternating dynamic loads
■ are used, for example, where loads acting in conjunction
with small swivel angles would damage rolling element
bearings
– they are a plain bearing alternative to tapered roller
bearings of series 320 X to DIN 720
■ can transmit motion and loads with low moment levels
– they can thus keep bending stresses away from
the adjacent structure
■ are designed as standard for grease lubrication
– are lubricated via the outer ring.
Axial spherical plain bearings
■ are complete units comprising shaft locating and housing
locating washers with a steel/steel sliding contact surface
– the shaft locating washer is supported in the ball
socket-shaped sliding zone of the housing locating
washer
■ can support axial loads
■ can transmit support loads into the adjacent construction
with low moment levels
■ can be combined with radial spherical plain bearings
of dimension series E to ISO 12 240-1
– in order to support radial loads
■ are lubricated via the housing locating washer.

Design and safety guidelines
Note the ratio C r (Ca)/P (Predimensioning, page 22 and
Table 1). The permissible ratio is decisively dependent on
the operating conditions, lubricant and the required
operating life.
The parts of different bearings are not interchangeable with
each other.
The relubrication intervals must be observed.
If oil lubrication is to be used, the bearings must be provided
with different lubrication groove systems (suffix F10, page 13).
If fitting is carried out with the aid of refrigeration by means
of dry ice or liquid nitrogen, the material may undergo a volume
increase that may eliminate the bearing clearance in certain
circumstances.
Angular contact spherical plain bearings
If angular contact spherical plain bearings are to transmit axial
and radial loads, the bearings can be installed in pairs
in an O or X arrangement (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
The precondition is: axial clearance (0,1  0,05 mm).

Axial spherical plain bearings
Axial spherical plain bearings
If axial spherical plain bearings are to be combined with radial
spherical plain bearings of dimension series E to ISO 12 240-1
in order to support radial loads, the axial and radial load must
be distributed over both bearings.
In order to achieve this:
■ the pin must have a radial release of approx. 1 mm in
the shaft locating washer (Figure 3) or
■ the pin must only be in contact with the large end surface of
the shaft locating washer (Figure 3).

f H = 35 · 0,121 + 1,28 = 5,515
LN = 1167104 · 5,64 · 5,515 = 36 304 102 osc.
Further results
Total life for piston rod side
Lh = 48 408 h
Total life for cylinder base side
Lh = 1324 h
The life result for the cylinder base linkage reflects the negative
influence of small swivel angles and thus low sliding speeds on
the life of spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel sliding
contact surface.
Longer running times could only be achieved by using a larger
bearing.

Spherical plain bearings
requiring maintenance
Radial spherical plain bearings
Angular contact spherical plain bearings
Axial spherical plain bearings
Accuracy
The main dimensions conform to ISO 12 240-1 to -3.
The exceptions are:
■ radial spherical plain bearings GE..HO-2RS
■ spherical plain bearings in inch sizes.
The dimensional and geometrical accuracy of the inside and
outside diameters corresponds to ISO 12 240-1 to -3.
Dimensional and tolerance values are arithmetic means.
Dimensional inspection is carried out in accordance with
ISO 8 015.
The tolerances of spherical plain bearings with a steel/steel
sliding contact surface may differ slightly from the stated values
due to the surface treatment applied. However, this does not
affect the fitting and operating characteristics of the bearings.
Spherical plain bearings with split outer ring
The outside diameter is within the deviations given in the tables
before surface treatment and splitting.
The outer rings become slightly out of round due to splitting.
The roundness of the outer ring is restored once it is fitted in
a housing bore produced in accordance with the specifications
(Figure 6).
Measurements taken of the outside diameter of the
unfitted bearing cannot be used as the original actual
values for the outside diameter.

Maintenance-free rod ends
Design and safety guidelines
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating C r (dimension table) refers to
the spherical plain bearing when fitted. It represents a factor
used for calculating the bearing life.
The equivalent bearing load and additional bending stresses in
the shank area are taken into consideration if:
■ in addition to radial load in a tensile or compressive direction,
other transverse forces act in an axial direction to the shank.
Basic static load rating
The basic static load rating C0r (dimension table) of the rod end
refers only to the load carrying capacity of the rod end housing.
It indicates:
■ the maximum constant tensile load when utilising 83%
of the material yield strength in the most highly stressed
cross-section.
Permissible loading of rod ends
The permissible loading of rod ends depends on the type
of load.
Pulsating or alternating loads subject the material to greater
stress than constant loads. The reduction factors fb must
therefore be used for these operating conditions in calculation
(Table 1).
In rod ends with the sliding material E LGOGLIDE®,
the basic static load rating C0r of the housing is less than
the basic dynamic load rating C r of the bearing.
1) f b values are also valid for sealed designs (-2RS).

Calculation of rating life
Two calculations must always be carried out:
■ the permissible load on the rod end
■ the life of the spherical plain bearing.
The equivalent bearing load P must not exceed

Rod ends requiring maintenance
Hydraulic rod ends
Design and safety guidelines
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load ratings C r (dimension table) refer to
the spherical plain bearing when fitted. They represent a factor
used for calculating the bearing life.
The equivalent bearing load and additional bending stresses
in the shank area are taken into consideration if:
■ in addition to radial load in a tensile or compressive direction,
other transverse forces act in an axial direction to the shank.
Basic static load rating
The basic static load ratings C0r (dimension table) of rod ends
refer only to the load carrying capacity of the rod end housing.
They are based on tensile/compressive loads acting across or
in the direction of the rod end shank.
Permissible loading of rod ends
The permissible loading of rod ends depends on the type
of load.
Pulsating or alternating loads subject the material to greater
stress than constant loads. The reduction factors fb must
therefore be used for these operating conditions in calculation
(Table 1).
Maintenance
Rod ends requiring maintenance must be lubricated. They have
relubrication facilities, except for smaller rod ends of some
series that do not have lubrication grooves and lubrication
holes. These rod ends are indicated in the dimension tables.
Rod ends to ISO 12 240-4, dimension series E – bore diameter
d = 15 mm to 20 mm – are relubricated via a hole in the rod end
eye housing (Figure 1). For reasons of housing strength,
these rod ends do not have lubrication nipples.
Tightening torques for fixing screws in hydraulic rod ends
The fixing screws must be tightened according to
the scheme (Table 2, Figures 2 and 3, page 147).
The tightening torques must be adhered to.
1) f b values are also valid for sealed designs (-2RS).

Other products
Other products in the range:
■ are special products which differ from the catalogue range in
type and design
■ are products for special bearing arrangement problems
■ are produced exclusively for specific customers or orders.
In order to achieve the most favourable solution in technical and
economic terms using products from this range, the
development should be discussed and agreed as early as
possible in the project with the manufacturer's engineering
service.
Special rod ends
■ comprise a rod end and spherical plain bearing whose
inner ring is in the form of a mounting lug
■ can be combined with a hydraulic rod end, for example
for fitting on the piston side to a hydraulic cylinder
■ are made from high strength forged materials
■ are easy to fit and service – the lug is fixed to the moving part
by cap head screws
■ can be quickly and easily fitted and are more easily
dismantled than conventional pin arrangements due to
the screw connection
■ require no precision fixtures, shafts or anti-rotation devices
on the customer's part (leading to cost savings).
Locating bearings for articulated frame steering
■ are used as locating bearings in frame steering systems
for construction machinery
■ can support high radial and axial loads
■ have sliding zones of a special geometrical design.
This prevents edge stresses in the part of the bearing under
axial load
■ are supplied preadjusted. There is therefore no need
for clearance adjustment by the customer.

Prop shaft centring bearings
■ are movable cardanic centring elements
■ are used to damp vibrations in rear and four wheel drive
vehicles in the centre of the coupling between the gearbox
and prop shaft
■ support the prop shaft mass on the coupling,
preventing eccentricity of the elastically coupled shafts.
Flanged spherical plain bearings
■ are used in clutch actuation systems
■ are maintenance-free.
Joint connecting rods
■ are used in brake actuation systems
■ contain maintenance-free spherical plain bearings.

Other products
Spherical plain bearings for clearance-free bearing
arrangements
■ are used in clearance-free bearing arrangements for control
elements such as gear levers
■ have a plastic/steel sliding contact surface
■ compensate wear up to 0,4 mm due to the use of preloaded
rubber elements
■ have preload values comparable to a new bearing even after
a long operating life
■ are maintenance-free throughout their operating life after
initial greasing.
Gear lever bearing arrangements
■ are developed to meet the specific requirements of
the vehicle manufacturer
■ give continuous compensation of the operating clearance
■ have a constant tilting moment
■ are maintenance-free for the life of the vehicle
■ can be combined with noise and vibration damping
measures.
Brake pedal linkages
■ are spherical plain bearing units
■ connect the brake pedal to the brake servo unit
■ give positive transmission of the brake pedal stroke and
pedal force moment-free by means of a coupling on both
sides
■ have a rod end at one end fixed to the aluminium linkage rod
to prevent rotation
■ have a rod end on the other end with a thread for adjusting
the rod length. The set position is then fixed using a locknut.
A sheet metal safety lug is formed about the pressure pipe
and spot welded.
