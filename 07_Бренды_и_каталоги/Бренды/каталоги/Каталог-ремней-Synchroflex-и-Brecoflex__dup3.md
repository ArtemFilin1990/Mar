The E tension member
Highly flexible tension inserts - the E steel cord tension member
The thinner the single wire, the more flexible the
overall tension member! This interrelation led us to
develop BRECO® BRECOFLEX® and SYNCHROFLEX®
TIMING BELTS with E tension members.
In the E tension member the tension member cross-
section is distributed to a lot more thin individual
wires and, therefore, the bending fatigues are
markedly lower in the individual wires. The
advantage of the E tension members is a higher
flexibility.
This is especially important, when smaller mounting
dimensions for pulleys and tension rollers are
required. The minimum number of teeth and/or
minimum diameter of the pulleys can be fallen below
up to 30% compared with standard tension
members.
Timing belts with E tension members are
recommended for multi-shaft drive with frequent
bends.
Summary:
•
thinner individual wires in the steel cord
•
higher dynamic capabilities
•
extremely high bonding and bending fatigue
strength
•
smaller pulley and tension roller diameter
•
no correction of the synchronising pulleys are
necessary

AT GEN III / ATP GEN III
AT / ATP high performance timing belt  -  GEN III
SYNCHROFLEX® TIMING BELT (SFX)
A powerful basis
The combination of high tensile steel cord tension
members and wear resistant polyurethane forms the
basis for dimensionally stabel and high resistant
polyurethane timing belts. A technology convincing
with excellent product properties.
• constant length, no post-elongation
• high dimensional stability
• Transmission of high torques
• quite run
• maintenance-free
• no timing belt lubrication
• high resistance against mechanical and
chemical influences
Each generation is different.
GEN III is better!
The intensive development work on the
SYNCHROFLEX® TIMING BELTS of the AT and ATP
series emphasizing on the power drives has proven
successful,  because an increase in power transmission
of up to 25% of the new generation compared to the
AT / ATP standard could be achieved. A further
economical plus: All SYNCHROFLEX® TIMING BELTS
GEN III are suitable for application with standard AT /
ATP synchronising pulleys.
For all partners in the Mulco Europe EWIV progress
means to provide the best possible solution for each
product down to the smallest technical detail. This is
achieved for the new SYNCHROFLEX® GEN III of the
AT and ATP series by the use of a two-filament
tension member arrangement and with a higher
density.
The new high performance polyurethane is
distinguished by numerou performance
improvements. Thus, amongst others, it is possible to
consider a higher number of load bearing teeth in
the calculation by an increased hardness.

AT / ATP high performance timing belt  -  GEN III
SYNCHROFLEX®-GEN III - a higher power
transmission of up to 25% compared to the AT / ATP
standard:
• due to closer wound cords Fadm to max. +45%
• strongly reduced wandering-off tendency /
optimised straight run due to two-filament tension
members and balanced twist direction in S and Z
design
• reduced friction at the flange
• minimised running noise with reduced belt width
and equal performance
• Fspec +25%
• longer longevity
• Circumferential force distribution to a number of
load bearing teeth increased by up to 30%
• Application up to 100°C
(for performance values in the limit range please

1. Tooth shear strength
In the calculation it will be used ze = 12 (see basis of calculation).
Calculation of the belt width with the nominal speed of the power equations.
Calculation of the belt width under start-up torque when rotational speed n = 0.
The belt width is to be determined from the least favourable load conditions.
Selected: the next larger standard belt width b = 100 mm.
2. Tension cord strength
The corresponding circumferencial force can be calculated from the general data
supplied:
The tabular value Fadm for AT 10 with 100 mm belt width is 16000 N. Thus, there is a
sufficient tension member safety factor.
3. Flexibility
The design is a drive „without contraflexure“. The minimum number of teeth
according to the table is adhered to.
The drive is correctly designed with a belt width of 100 mm. A maintenance-free
operation can be expected.
