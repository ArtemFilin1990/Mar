Foreword
Many applications require bearings that are 
suitable for oscillating movements and that can 
accommodate misalignment. Rolling bearings 
only partly fulfil these requirements as they are 
generally designed for continuous rotation and 
can only accommodate limited misalignment.
Therefore, SKF manufactures spherical plain 
bearings and rod ends to provide an economical 
solution to these challenges.  
This catalogue presents the current assortment of SKF spherical plain bearings and rod 
ends. 
Structure of the catalogue
The catalogue starts with general product information, followed by nine main chapters, which 
are marked with numbered blue tabs in the right 
margin:
• Chapter 1 provides design and application 
recommendations.
• Chapters 2 to 7 describe the various bearing 
and rod end types. Each chapter contains 
descriptions of the products as well as product tables, listing data for selecting a bearing 
or rod end and designing the bearing 
arrangement.
• Chapter 8 is an overview about other SKF 
products and services.
• In chapter 9, all products presented in this 
catalogue are listed in alphabetical order by 
designation. 
About the data in this catalogue
The data in this catalogue relate to SKF’s stateof-the-art technology and production capabilities as of beginning 2010. The data may differ 
from that shown in earlier catalogues because 
of revised methods of calculation, redesign or

following new information and product data 
have been included for radial spherical plain 
bearings: 
• Bearings in the TX series have been added 
and are available with bore diameters up to 
800 mm.
• Bearings in the maintenance-free series are 
fitted with LS seals as standard. 
• Bearings with the sliding material FSA have 
been replaced by the FBAS design.
• Bearings requiring maintenance are also 
available with LS seals.
• Part of the inch assortment is also available 
with LS seals.

General product information
Properties
Spherical plain bearings
Spherical plain bearings are standardized, 
ready-to-mount, mechanical components that 
enable multi-directional, self-aligning movements. The inner ring has a spherical convex 
outside diameter, while the outer ring has a  
correspondingly concave inside diameter 
(† fig. 1). The forces acting on the bearing may 
be static or may occur when the bearing makes 
oscillating or recurrent tilting and slewing 
movements at relatively low speeds. 
Spherical plain bearing
Design advantages inherent to spherical plain 
bearings include the ability to: 
• accommodate misalignment († fig. 2)
• virtually eliminate edge stresses and  
excessive stressing of adjacent components 
(† fig. 3)
• accommodate deformation of surrounding 
components in operation († fig. 4)
• accommodate wide manufacturing tolerances 
and the use of cost-effective, welded assemblies († fig. 5)
Spherical plain bearings are designed to accommodate 
misalignment


Compared to bushings, spherical plain bearings provide 
higher reliability, as the chance of edge stresses and 
overloading are virtually non-existent
Fig. 4
Shaft deflection does not have a negative influence on 
bearing service life, the shaft or housing
Fig. 5
Spherical plain bearings can accommodate the wide 
manufacturing tolerances found in cost-effective 
welded assemblies
Rod ends
Spherical plain bearing rod ends are bearing 
units that consist of a spherical plain bearing in 
the eye-shaped head of the rod end housing 
(† fig. 6). They are used primarily on the ends 
of hydraulic or pneumatic pistons to join the  
cylinder to an associated component via an 
internal (female) thread, external (male) thread 
or a welding shank († fig. 7 on page 16).
SKF supplies rod ends with a threaded shank 
with a right-hand thread as standard. With the 
exception of rod ends with the designation suffix 
VZ019, all rod ends are also available with a 
left-hand thread. They are identified by the  
designation prefix L.
Fig. 6

General product information
Bearing designs and features
SKF spherical plain bearings and rod ends are 
an excellent choice for applications that require 
total design economy. These state-of-the-art 
products are available in a wide assortment of 
designs, dimension series and sizes to meet the 
needs of a particular application. Fig. 7 shows 
the general bearing and rod end types.
Whether the application calls for a large 
spherical plain bearing or a small rod end 
assembly, both are available from SKF and offer:
• long service life
• minimal maintenance
• high operational reliability
SKF spherical plain bearings and rod ends, produced with standard dimensions, are available 
worldwide, making them readily accessible 
whenever and wherever they are needed. 
Economic considerations and unparalleled 
design characteristics are not the only reasons 
that SKF spherical plain bearings and rod ends 
are the ultimate solution for any plain bearing 
application. Their designs, materials and manufacturing quality enable long service life and 
high reliability even in the most demanding 
applications.

Bearings and rod ends 
requiring maintenance
Bearings and rod ends requiring maintenance 
must be greased prior to being put into operation. With the exception of a few applications, 
they must be relubricated periodically.
SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings 
are made of bearing steel and are through-hardened. The high-strength sliding contact surfaces 
are phosphated and treated with a special running-in lubricant. These bearings are used  
primarily in applications where there are:
• heavy static loads
• heavy alternating loads
• shock loads
They are also relatively insensitive to contaminants and high temperatures.
To facilitate relubrication, lubrication holes 
and grooves are provided in both the inner and 
outer rings of all steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearings – with the exception of a few small sizes. 
SKF steel/bronze rod ends also require relubrication. However, requirements are less stringent 
than for steel/steel rod ends, as the emergency 
running properties of bronze are more forgiving 
than steel.
The multi-groove system
Standard steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings that must accommodate minor alignment 
movements under very heavy, constant direction 
loads are prone to lubricant starvation. To maximize the effects of the lubricant under these 
conditions, SKF has developed the multi-groove 
system and manufactures all metric steel/steel 
radial spherical plain bearings with an outside 
dia meter D ≥ 150 mm with the multi-groove 
system on the sliding surface of the outer ring 
as standard († fig. 8). Metric steel/steel radial 
spherical plain bearings with an outside diameter D < 150 mm can be supplied with the multi-groove system on request. These bearings 
are identified by the designation suffix ESL.
These lubrication grooves provide the following benefits:
• improved lubricant supply to the loaded zone
• enlarged lubricant reservoir in the bearing
• enable relubrication under load
• extended relubrication intervals
• space for wear particles and contaminants
• extended grease life
The main benefit of the multi-groove system 
is that it improves lubricant distribution in the 
heavily loaded zone to extend service life and/or 
maintenance intervals.
Fig. 8

General product information
Maintenance-free, long-life 
sliding contact surfaces
“Maintenance-free” is an industry-wide term 
used to describe plain bearings and rod ends 
with self-lubricating sliding contact surface 
combinations. The term maintenance-free  
does not imply that these bearings should not 
be inspected as part of a regularly scheduled 
maintenance program.
These so-called maintenance-free bearings 
and rod ends offer a number of advantages for 
OEMs and end users alike. These advantages, 
which include minimal maintenance and 
reduced lubricant consumption, quickly compensate for the difference in the initial purchase 
price when compared to standard steel/steel 
bearing solutions. And of course, the impact that 
maintenance-free bearings have on the environment is an added benefit.
To offer maintenance-free solutions for the 
greatest number of applications, SKF produces 
spherical plain bearings and rod ends with different sliding contact surface combinations 
(† fig 9). These combinations, which in some 
cases are size dependent, include:
• steel/PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) sintered 
bronze
• steel/PTFE fabric
• steel/PTFE FRP (fibre reinforced polymer)
Maintenance-free bearings can operate without 
grease, and therefore do not need to be relubricated. Depending on the sliding surfaces, grease 
can improve bearing service life or can have  
a negative effect on it. Therefore, SKF does not 
recommend the use of lubricants for bearings 
with steel/PTFE sintered bronze or steel/PTFE 
fabric sliding contact surface com binations, 
whereas initial lubrication followed by occasional 
relubrication of steel/PTFE FRP bearings can 
extend the service life of the bearing.
Be aware that “maintenance-free” refers to 
bearing service life only, and does not refer to 
the service life of an application or general 
maintenance intervals of other machine parts in 
the application. For detailed information about 
the life of spherical plain bearings or rod ends, 
refer to the section Basic rating life starting on 
page 39. The basic rating life as a guideline value for the service life under certain operating 
conditions can be calculated using the information provided in the section Basic rating life calculation starting on page 51.
Self-lubricating, dry sliding materials are not 
as stiff as steel and consequently are subject to 
greater deformation under load than steel. 
These sliding materials are also more sensitive 
than steel to alternating or shock loads. If either 
of these load conditions exists, contact the SKF 
application engineering service.
Maintenance-free bearings and rod ends are 
designed for applications where:
• load direction is constant and may be heavy
• low coefficient of friction is necessary
• relubrication is not possible or difficult

Optional SKF design 
features
A choice of materials
For most applications, SKF spherical plain  
bearings made of standard bearing steel requiring maintenance are an excellent choice. However, for difficult operating environments, SKF 
maintenance-free stainless steel spherical plain 
bearings may be preferred. For other material 
options, e.g. surface treatments, contact the 
SKF application engineering service.
With or without seals
Most popular sizes of SKF spherical plain bearings 
are available either open (without seals) or 
sealed on both sides († fig. 10). Standard 
sealed bearings can increase the service life of 
a bearing and save space, while reducing inventory and assembly costs. Maintenance-free 
bearings without seals have to be protected 
against contaminants.
Spherical plain bearings fitted on both sides 
with the SKF RS double lip seal are very effective, under normal operating conditions, at keeping contaminants away from the sliding contact 
surfaces. These seals also effectively retain the 
grease and therefore are appropriate for bearings requiring maintenance.
Maintenance-free bearings and all bearings 
operating in highly contaminated environments 
should be fitted with the SKF LS triple-lip 
heavy-duty contact seal († page 79). They are 
reinforced with a steel insert and have three seal 
lips. These very effective seals protect the bearing against contaminants and enhance the 
operational reliability of the spherical plain 
bearing.
Wide operating temperature range
SKF spherical plain bearings and rod ends can 
operate effectively over a wide temperature 
range. The operating temperature range of open 
(without seals) steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearings is –50 to +200 °C.

General product information
Multi-purpose performance
Typical applications 
Long service life, high reliability and minimal 
maintenance are some of the features of SKF 
spherical plain bearings and rod ends. SKF’s 
wide assortment of spherical plain bearings and 
rod ends is versatile enough to be used in a  
variety of applications that encompass almost  
all sectors of industry, including:
• agriculture
• construction
• forklift trucks
• material handling
• metals
• mining
• railways
• trucks
• wind energy
Application examples
Suspended roof
SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings are 
in service in an unusual and world-renowned 
application, the roof of the Olympic Stadium  
in Munich, Germany († fig. 11). The roof is 
constructed of a number of pre-stressed steel 
cables in a network. The nodal points of the network must be torque-free. That is where 225 
standard SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearings with bore diameters ranging from 160 
to 300 mm are located. The nodes are statically 
loaded but must enable occasional swinging 
movements of the roof construction.
Although SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearings are typically not maintenance-free, 
these particular bearings have not been relubricated since the construction of the building in 
1972.
What better proof could there be for lasting 
quality and reliability?

12) enable a road roller to manoeuvre. This joint 
must be able to withstand very heavy radial 
loads and high vibration levels. Due to their 
location, the bearings should be protected as 
they are exposed to a variety of contaminants 
including dust, dirt, water and hot tarmac, 
which promote premature wear and corrosion.
SKF maintenance-free spherical plain bearings help to eliminate the need for relubrication, 
and reduce the total cost of ownership.
Truck twin-axle supports
An SKF spherical plain bearing arrangement on 
the truck twin-axle support provides even load 
distribution between the two axles for trucks 
driving on rough roads or off-highway conditions († fig. 13). This bearing arrangement is 
subjected to heavy loads and, depending on the 
conditions, heavy shock loads, and frequent 
alignment movements.
These bearings are located behind the tires  
in an area that is very difficult to access, making 
it imperative that sudden bearing damage or 
failure, requiring immediate roadside repairs,  
be avoided at all cost. A pair of SKF angular contact spherical plain bearings mounted in a backto-back arrangement can help prevent these 
emergencies. These bearings, which can withstand all the rigours of truck duty, are simple to 
install and easy to maintain.

General product information
Newspaper conveyor
Speed and flexibility are all-important when 
producing newspapers, not only in the printing 
process, but also in distribution. The conveyor 
system from the printing press to the loading 
dock is a very important component if the newspapers are to be delivered on time.
The endless conveyor chain is one such system. It consists of a multitude of links, which 
together provide the speed and flexibility 
required. Fig. 16 shows an application where 
more than 1 000 SKF maintenance-free  
spherical plain bearings with the sliding contact 
surface combination steel/PTFE sintered bronze 
are used. The bearings have been in daily service 
without maintenance for many years.
Dam gates
Segment gates for dams and other barrages  
are home to large-size SKF maintenance-free 
spherical plain bearings († fig. 14). The reference list is very long – with over 3 000 applications to date.
As main bearings, they compensate for shaft 
misalignment, caused by thermal expansion 
and contraction, elastic deformation of the dam 
gates as well as changes caused by settling of 
the foundation. These bearings cope with the 
heavy radial loads caused by water pressure as 
well as axial loads that arise from the inclined 
position of the support arms.
In addition, SKF spherical plain bearings not 
only serve as heavily loaded bearings under 
static conditions, they also operate in the frequently used linkage attachments of the lifting 
and plunger cylinders as well as the flaps.
Hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders
SKF steel/steel and steel/bronze rod ends are 
frequently used on hydraulic and pneumatic  
cylinders († fig. 15). Acting as the link between 
the cylinder and its attachments, they are able 
to transmit heavy mechanical loads.
Hydraulic cylinders (e.g. to ISO 8132) are 
often fitted with steel/steel rod ends with a 
female thread that can be secured (compressible) on one end and a steel/steel rod end with 
a welding shank on the other.
These types of hydraulic cylinders can be 
found in all types of construction equipment, 
agricultural machinery, lifting equipment and 
shutters, recycling depot presses as well as  
other heavily loaded manoeuvring equipment.
In pneumatic cylinders where working pressures regularly reach 1 MPa, steel/bronze rod 
ends and maintenance-free rod ends are typically used at the end of the piston rod. At the 
opposite end, SKF rod ends with a welding 
shank are used.

Load ratings
There is no standardized method for determining the load ratings of spherical plain bearings 
and rod ends, nor is there any standardized definition. As different manufacturers define load 
ratings differently, it is not possible to compare 
the load ratings of bearings produced by one 
manufacturer with those of another.
Basic dynamic load rating
The basic dynamic load rating C is used, together with other influencing factors, to determine 
the basic rating life of spherical plain bearings 
and rod ends. As a rule, it represents the maximum load that a spherical plain bearing or rod 
end can accommodate at room temperature 
when there is movement between the sliding 
contact surfaces († fig. 1). The maximum load 
in any application should always be considered 
in relation to the required rating life. The basic 
dynamic load ratings quoted in the product 
tables are based on the specific load factor K 
(† table 4 on page 45) and the effective  
projected sliding surface.
Basic static load rating
The basic static load rating C0 represents the 
maximum permissible load that a spherical plain 
bearing or rod end can accommodate when 
there is no relative movement between the  
sliding contact surfaces († fig. 2).
For spherical plain bearings, the basic static 
load rating represents the maximum load that 
the bearing can accommodate at room temperature without inadmissible deforming, fracturing or damaging the sliding contact surfaces. 
The basic static load ratings quoted for SKF 
spherical plain bearings are based on a specific 
Dynamic bearing load
 Static bearing load


static load factor K0 († table 4 on page 45) 
and the effective projected sliding surface. It is 
assumed that the bearing is adequately supported. To fully exploit the static load rating of a 
spherical plain bearing, it is generally necessary 
to use shafts and housings made of highstrength materials. The basic static load rating 
must also be considered when bearings are 
dynamically loaded and subjected to additional 
heavy shock loads. The total load in these cases 
must not exceed the basic static load rating. 
For rod ends, it is the strength of the housing 
at room temperature, under a constant load 
acting in the direction of the shank axis, that is 
the determining factor. The basic static load  
rating represents a safety factor of at least 1,2 
relative to the yield strength of the material of 
the rod end housing, under the above 
conditions.
Basic rating life
For spherical plain bearings, a lubricant film  
that fully separates the sliding contact surfaces 
cannot be formed. Therefore, the sliding contact 
surfaces make direct contact with each other, 
resulting in a certain and unavoidable degree of 
wear. This increases the internal clearance in 
the bearing.
Regarding the life of spherical plain bearings 
or rod ends, a distinction is made between the 
basic rating life and the service life. The basic 
rating life is a theoretical guideline value, used 
to estimate the service life. Service life depends 
on the actual operating conditions and is the 
actual life achieved by the bearing in service. 
The basic rating life is based on a large 
number of laboratory tests. The bearings were 
tested for an operating period until a specific 
increase in bearing clearance or friction 
occurred († table 1 on page 40). The basic 
rating life considers several influencing factors 
and can be expressed in operating hours or the 
number of oscillating movements († fig. 3). In 
some cases, however, it is not possible to quantify factors such as contamination, corrosion, 
and complex kinematic loads. Therefore, the 
basic rating life can be attained or exceeded by 
j
j = angle of oscillation = 2 b
A complete oscillation is from point 0 to point 4 and = 4 b
Angle of oscillation
the majority of many apparently identical spherical plain bearings under the same operating 
conditions. For the calculation methods of the 
different sliding contact surface combinations 
as well as calculation examples, refer to the section Basic rating life calculation starting on 
page 51.
The service life cannot be calculated as it is 
too complex to determine and evaluate all the 
influencing factors. Therefore, depending on the 
application conditions, the service life may differ 
from the basic rating life.
NOTE: By using the SKF Interactive Engineering 
Catalogue and its incorporated calculation programs, it is possible to perform the necessary 
calculations to select a spherical plain bearing 
with the click of a mouse. The product data necessary for the calculations is automatically put 
in by selecting a spher ical plain bearing or rod

Load
When considering load, a distinction is made 
between:
• load direction
– radial load († fig. 4) 
– axial load († fig. 5)
– combined (axial and radial) load († fig. 6)
• type of load 
– dynamic load, i.e. there is relative sliding 
movement in the loaded bearing
– static load, i.e. there is no relative movement in the loaded bearing
• load conditions
– constant load († fig. 7), i.e. the direction in 
which the load is applied does not change 
and the same part of the bearing (loaded 
zone) is always subjected to the load 
– alternating load († fig. 8), i.e. change of 
load direction so that zones at opposite 
positions in the bearing are alternately 
loaded and unloaded 
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
The load can be inserted directly into the equation for the specific bearing load p († page 46) 
if the magnitude of the load is constant and if 
the load acting on:
• radial and angular contact spherical plain 
bearings is purely radial
• thrust spherical plain bearings is purely axial
• rod ends is purely radial and in the direction 
of the shank axis 
In all other cases it is necessary to calculate the 
equivalent dynamic bearing load P. If the magnitude of the load is not constant, use the equation provided in the section Variable load and 
sliding velocity († page 61).

Radial spherical plain bearings
Radial spherical plain bearings can accommodate a certain magnitude of axial load Fa in addition to a simultaneously acting radial load Fr

is constant in magnitude, the equivalent dynamic bearing load can be calculated using
P = y Fr

P = equivalent dynamic bearing load [kN]

axial to the radial load Fa/Fr († diagram 3)
Thrust spherical plain bearings 
Thrust spherical plain bearings can accommodate a radial load Fr in addition to an axial load 
Fa († fig. 10). However, the radial load must 
not exceed 50% of the simultaneously acting 
axial load. When the resultant load is constant in 
magnitude, then use
P = y Fa
P = equivalent dynamic bearing load [kN]
Fa = axial component of the load [kN]
y = load factor depending on the ratio of the 
radial to the axial load Fr/Fa  
(† diagram 4)
Equivalent static bearing load
If spherical plain bearings and rod ends are subjected to static loads, or very slight alignment 
movements, then the permissible load is not 
limited by wear, but by the strength of the sliding contact layer or the strength of the rod end 
housing.
If the actual load is a combined load, then  
an equivalent static bearing load must be calculated. For radial and angular contact spherical 
plain bearings, it can be calculated using
P0 = y Fr
For thrust spherical plain bearings, it can be  
calculated using
P0 = y Fa 
P0 = equivalent static bearing load [kN]
Fr = radial component of the load [kN]
Fa = axial component of the load [kN]
y = load factor that depends on the ratio of the 
axial to the radial load Fa/Fr 
– for radial bearings requiring maintenance († diagram 1)
– for maintenance-free radial bearings 
(† diagram 2)
– for angular contact spherical plain  
bearings († diagram 3) 
and load factor that depends on the ratio of
the radial to the axial load Fr/Fa
– for thrust spherical plain bearings  
(† diagram 4)


Permissible loads for rod ends
Rod ends are primarily intended for the support 
of radial loads acting in the direction of the 
shank axis. If loads act at angles to the shank 
axis († fig. 11), the maximum permissible load 
is reduced, as additional bending stresses occur 
in the shank. Under these conditions, consider 
the design and size dependent material used for 
the rod end housing († table 6 on page 170). 
The load portion acting perpendicular to the 
direction of the shank axis should never exceed 
the value of 0,1 C0. If heavier loads are involved, 
a larger rod end should be selected.
The maximum permissible load for a rod  
end in the direction of the shank axis can be  
calculated using
Pperm = C0 b2 b6
Pperm = maximum permissible load [kN]

Requisite bearing size
To determine the requisite size of a spherical 
plain bearing or rod end, it is necessary to know 
the requisite rating life for the application. This 
depends on the type of machine, the operating 
conditions and the demands regarding operational reliability. The following steps can be 
used to determine requisite bearing size:
1 Use the guideline values of the load ratio C/P 
provided in table 3 to obtain a requisite basic 
dynamic load rating C. Compare this value 
with the basic dynamic load rating of the 
bearings listed in the product tables.
2 Use diagrams 5 to 10 on pages 46 to 50 to 
check whether the sliding contact surface 
combination of the selected bearing or rod 
end can be used under the actual load p and 
sliding velocity v conditions. The specific 
bearing load p and the sliding velocity v 
needed to perform this check can be calculated as explained in the following sections:
a) If the pv diagram indicates that the basic 
rating life equation can be used, proceed 
to step 3.
b) If the pv diagram shows that the pv range 
is exceeded, select a bearing with a higher 
load carrying capacity.
3 Calculate the basic rating life († page 51) 
and proceed as follows:
a) If the calculated rating life is shorter than 
the requisite rating life, a larger bearing  
or rod end should be selected and the  
calculation repeated. 
b) If the calculated rating life is larger than 
the requisite rating life, the bearing or rod 
end can be selected for the application.
The bearing or rod end size is often determined 
by the dimensions of the associated components. In these cases, check the pv diagram to 
determine if the product is suitable.

NOTE: SKF manufactures all metric steel/steel 
radial spherical plain bearings with an outside 
diameter D ≥ 150 mm as standard with the 
multi-groove feature in the outer ring († page

extends relubrication intervals and bearing 
service life, especially in applications where 
there are constant direction loads († page 40).
These advantages are considered in the calculation of the basic rating life by the coloured 
regions in diagrams 13 and 14 for the factors 
for the angle of oscillation b5 and fb. The values 
of these two factors in the upper limit of the coloured area may be used for bearings with the

Variable load and sliding velocity
If the load and/or sliding velocity change during 
operation, calculate individual rating lives for the 
periods of constant load and sliding velocity. If 
the load and sliding velocity occur as shown in 
diagram 20a, the individual basic rating life can 
be calculated using the constant values of p and 
v. If the load and sliding velocity are not constant 
as shown in diagram 20b, first calculate the 
basic rating life for the individual time periods, 
using mean values for the load and sliding 
velocity for the individual time periods. Then 
calculate the total basic rating life using

Calculation examples
The following calculation examples illustrate the 
methods used to determine the requisite bearing size or the basic rating life for spherical plain 
bearings and rod ends.
1. Torque support of a concrete transporter
Given data
Purely radial load that alternates direction:  
Fr = 12 kN
Half angle of oscillation: b = 15°  
(† fig. 3 on page 39)
Frequency of oscillation: f = 10 min–1
Maximum operating temperature: +80 °C
Requirements
The bearing must have a basic rating life of 
7 000 h.
Calculations and selection
Because a bearing in this application must 
accommodate an alternating load, a steel/steel 
radial spherical plain bearing is the appropriate 
choice. Relubrication is planned after every 
40 hours of operation.
If, for the first check, a guideline value of 2 is 
used for the load ratio C/P († table 3 on page 
45), the required basic dynamic load rating C for 
the bearing is
C = 2 P = 24 kN 
Bearing GE 20 ES, with a C = 30 kN and a 
sphere diameter dk = 29 mm, is chosen from the 
product table on page 104.
To check the suitability of the bearing using 
the pv diagram († diagram 5 on page 46), calculate the specific bearing load using K = 100 
from table 4 on page 45.

P 
p = K  –– = 100 ¥ ––––  = 40 N/mm2

and the sliding velocity v using dm = dk = 29 mm, 
b = 15° and f = 10 min–1
v = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 dm b f 

= 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 29 ¥ 15 ¥ 10 = 0,0025 m/s
The values for p and v lie within the permissible 
operating range I of the pv diagram († diagram 
5 on page 46), for steel/steel radial spherical 
plain bearings. To calculate the basic rating life 
for initial lubrication, the values that apply are
b1 = 2 (alternating direction load)
b2 = 1 (operating temperature < 120 °C  
from table 5 on page 52)
b3 = 1,5 (from diagram 11 on page 51,  
for dk = 29 mm) 
b4 = 1,1 (from diagram 12 on page 52,  
for v = 0,0025 m/s)
b5 = 3,7 (from diagram 13 on page 52,  
for b = 15°)
p = 40 N/mm2 
v = 0,0025 m/s
Therefore

The basic rating life of the bearing that is relubricated regularly can now be calculated using
fb = 5,2 (from diagram 14 on page 53) 
fH = 1,8 (from diagram 15 on page 53, for a 
relubrication frequency H = Gh/N = 160/40 
= 4 with the relubrication interval of 40 h)
GhN = Gh fb fH = 160 ¥ 5,2 ¥ 1,8  

≈ 1 500 operating hours


Because this life is shorter than the required 
rating life of 7 000 h, a larger bearing is chosen 
and calculations are repeated.
Bearing GE 25 ES, with C = 48 kN and dk = 
35,5 mm, is chosen. The values for the specific 
bearing load lie within the permissible operating 
range I of the pv diagram († diagram 5 on 
page 46)

p = 100 ¥ –––– =25 N/mm2

and the sliding velocity is
v = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 35,5 ¥ 15 ¥ 10 = 0,0031 m/s
As before
b1 = 2, b2 = 1, b5 = 3,7
and now
b3 = 1,6 (from diagram 11 on page 51,  
for dk = 35,5 mm)
b4 = 1,2 (from diagram 12 on page 52 ,  
for v = 0,0031 m/s)
Therefore, the basic rating life for initial  
lubrication is

Gh = 2 ¥ 1 ¥ 1,6 ¥ 1,2 ¥ 3,7 ¥ –––––––––––––

With fb = 5,2 (from diagram 14 on page 53) 
and fH = 3 (from diagram 15 on page 53 for 
H = 480/40 = 12) the basic rating life for regular 
relubrication (N = 40 h) becomes
GhN = 480 ¥ 5,2 ¥ 3 ≈ 7 490 operating hours
This larger bearing satisfies the rating life 
requirement.

2. Attachment of a shock absorber of an  
off-highway vehicle
Given data:
Radial load: Fr = 7 kN
Axial load: Fa = 0,7 kN
Half angle of oscillation: b = 8° († fig. 3 on 
page 39)
Frequency of oscillation: f = 15 min–1
Load frequency: 2–5 Hz
Maximum operating temperature: +75 °C
Requirements:
This bearing must have a basic rating life corresponding to a driven distance of 100 000 km 
at an average speed of 65 km/h without 
maintenance.
Calculations and selection
For design reasons, a GE 20 C spherical plain 
bearing with a steel/PTFE sintered bronze sliding contact surface combination is proposed. 
From the product table on page 132, the basic 
dynamic load rating C = 31,5 kN and the sphere 
diameter dk = 29 mm are obtained.
First, the equivalent dynamic bearing load 
must be determined by
Fa/Fr = 0,7/7 = 0,1
From diagram 2 on page 42 factor y = 1,4. The 
equivalent dynamic bearing load is therefore
P = y Fr = 1,4 ¥ 7 = 9,8 kN
To check the suitability of the bearing size using 
the pv diagram 7 on page 48, calculate the values for the specific bearing load (using K = 100 
from table 4 on page 45) using

P 
9,8
p = K  –– = 100 ¥ ––––  = 31 N/mm2

31,5
and the sliding velocity (dm = dk = 29 mm).
v = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 dm b f 

= 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 29 ¥ 8 ¥ 15 = 0,002 m/s
The values for p and v lie within the permissible 
operating range I of the pv diagram where
b1 = 0,2 (from table 6 on page 54, for a load  
frequency over 0,5 Hz and 
25 < p < 40 N/mm2)
b2 = 1 (from diagram 16 on page 55, for temperatures < 80 °C)
The basic rating life for a GE 20 C bearing with 
the steel/PTFE sintered bronze sliding contact 
surface combination is

= 104 000 km. Therefore, the bearing satisfies 
the rating life requirement.

Requirements
A maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearing with a steel/PTFE fabric sliding contact surface combination is required for a rating life of 5 
years with 70 h of operation per week.
Calculations and selection
Using a guideline value for the load ratio C/P = 2 
(† table 3 on page 45), and with P = FrI the 
required basic dynamic load rating 
C = 2 P = 2 ¥ 300 = 600 kN
From the product table on page 136,  
a GE 60 TXE-2LS bearing with a basic dynamic 
load rating C = 695 kN and a sphere diameter 
dk = dm = 80 mm is chosen.
First, it is necessary to check that the operation cases I to III fall within the permissible 
range of the pv diagram 8 on page 49.
The sliding velocity is the same for all three 
cases. The angle of oscillation is specified as 2b, 
the time t as the time taken to pass through 2b 
in seconds. Complete cycle duration is 4b 
(† fig 3 on page 39).

page 49.
To make the lifetime estimate for variable

each load case has to be made separately, with

4. Linkages of a conveyor installation
Given data
Radial load of alternating direction: Fr = 5,5 kN
Half angle of oscillation: b = 15° († fig. 3 on 
page 39)
Frequency of oscillation: f = 25 min–1
Operating temperature: +70 °C
Requirements
A rod end is needed that provides a basic rating 
life of 9 000 hours under alternating load 
conditions.
Calculations and selection
Because the load is alternating, a steel/steel  
rod end is appropriate. Relubrication is planned 
every 40 hours of operation. Using the guideline 
value for the load ratio C/P = 2 from table 3 on 
page 45, and as P = Fr, the requisite basic 
dynamic load rating is
C = 2 P = 2 ¥ 5,5 = 11 kN
The SI 15 ES rod end with a basic dynamic load 
rating C = 17 kN is selected († page 172). The 
basic static load rating is C0 = 37,5 kN and the 
sphere diameter dk = 22 mm.
To check the suitability of rod end size using 
the pv diagram 5 on page 46, calculate the values for the specific bearing load (using K = 100 
from table 4 on page 45)

P 
p = K  –– = 100 ¥ ––––  = 32,4 N/mm2

695
and the mean sliding velocity (dm = dk = 22 mm)
v = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 dk b f  

= 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 22 ¥ 15 ¥ 25 = 0,0048 m/s
The values for p and v lie within the permissible 
range I of the pv diagram 5 on page 46.
Checking the permissible load on the rod end 
housing

b2 
= 1 (from table 5 on page 52,  
for temperatures < 120 °C)
b6

for rod ends with a lubrication hole)
Pperm = C0 b2 b6 

= 37,5 ¥ 1 ¥ 0,35  

= 13,125 kN > P
The following values of the factors are used to 
determine the basic rating life for initial lubrication only
b1 = 2 (alternating load)
b2 = 1 (for operating temperatures < 120 °C, 
from table 5 on page 52)
b3 = 1,3 (from diagram 11 on page 51,  
for dk = 22 mm)
b4 = 1,6 (from diagram 12 on page 52,  
for v = 0,0048 m/s) 
b5 = 3,7 (from diagram 13 on page 52,  
for b = 15°)
p = 32 N/mm2
v = 0,0048 m/s
Therefore

Gh = b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 ––––––––––––––

fH

for H = Gh/N = 177/40 = 4,4)
GhN = Gh fb fH = 177 ¥ 5,2 ¥ 2  

≈ 1 840 operating hours


The required basic rating life of 9 000 h is not 
achieved; therefore a larger rod end has to be 
selected. A SI 20 ES rod end, with C = 30 kN, 
C0 = 57 kN and dk = 29 mm is selected and the 
calculation repeated.
The values for the specific bearing load

P 
5,5
p = K  –– = 100 ¥ ––––  = 18,3 N/mm2

and the mean sliding velocity (dm = dk = 29 mm)
v = 5,82 ¥ 10–7 ¥ 29 ¥ 15 ¥ 25 = 0,0063 m/s
both lie within the permissible range I. It is not 
necessary to check the permissible rod end 
housing load since the basic static load rating of 
the larger rod end is higher. Also, as before
b1 = 2; b2 = 1 and b5 = 3,7
while
b3 = 1,4 (from diagram 11 on page 51,  
for dk = 29 mm)
b4 = 1,8 (from diagram 12 on page 52,  
for v = 0,0063 m/s)
so that

330
Gh = 2 ¥ 1 ¥ 1,4 ¥ 1,8 ¥ 3,7 ¥–––––––––––––––

18,32,5 ¥ 0,0063

≈ 681 operating hours
With fb = 5,2 (from diagram 14 on page 53) 
and fH = 3,7 (from diagram 15 on page 53, for 
H = 681/40 ≈ 17) the basic rating life for regular 
relubrication (N = 40 h) becomes
GhN = 681 ¥ 5,2 ¥ 3,7 

≈ 13 100 operating hours
Therefore, the larger rod end meets the rating 
life requirements.


Friction
The friction in a spherical plain bearing or rod 
end depends primarily on the sliding contact 
surface combination, the load and the sliding 
velocity. Because there are so many influencing 
factors that are not mutually independent, it is 
not possible to quote exact values for the coefficient of friction. Under laboratory conditions, 
however, it is possible to record the coefficient  
of friction for different sliding contact surface 
combinations. The friction during the running-in 
phase is higher than the value recorded during 
the subsequent test period.
Guideline values for the coefficient of friction 
µ are listed in table 1. They have been determined in laboratory trials. 
The coefficient of friction for maintenancefree steel/PTFE fabric and steel/PTFE sintered 
bronze sliding contact surface combinations 
decrease with increasing specific load. At a  
constant specific load, friction is reduced to the 
given minimum value as soon as the transfer of 
PTFE from the sliding layer to the opposing steel 
surface is complete. The frictional moment for  
a spherical plain bearing or rod end can be calculated using
M = 0,5 µ P dm
M = frictional moment [Nm]
µ = coefficient of friction († table 1)
P = equivalent dynamic bearing load [kN]
dm = inner ring mean diameter [mm] 
dm = dk for radial spherical plain bearings and 
rod ends
dm = 0,9 dk for angular contact spherical plain 
bearings
dm = 0,7 dk for thrust spherical plain bearings
dk = inner ring sphere diameter [mm]

surface combinations (guideline values)

After the bearing has been in operation for an 
extended period of time, negative influences 
(contamination, inadequate lubrication) may 
cause the bearing to approach or exceed the 
maximum values for the coefficient of friction 
listed in the table. Bearings are susceptible to 
this phenomenon even under light loads and 
especially under harsh operating conditions. In 
applications where friction is particularly important, SKF recommends determining the power 
ratings by using the maximum values for the 
coefficient of friction that are listed in table 1. 
For bearings operating under conditions of 
mixed or dry friction, there may be slight differences between adhesive and sliding friction. 
Experience has shown that it is not possible to 
eliminate stick-slip entirely and that it most frequently occurs when support elements lack 
adequate stiffness. In most applications, however, the effects are negligible.

Design of bearing arrangements
Design of bearing 
arrangements
Radial location of bearings 
The inner and outer rings of spherical plain 
bearings must be radially secured (located) 
to the shaft and in the housing so that sliding 
movements occur in the bearing and do not 
result in ring creep. Ring creep occurs when 
a ring turns on its seat in the circumferential 
direction under load. To locate a bearing in the 
radial direction usually requires an interference 
fit. However, an interference fit cannot always 
be applied, e.g. if easy mounting and dismounting are required, or if the bearing must be able 
to be displaced axially without restraint.
The appropriate fit is always determined 
by the operating conditions. 
1. Type and magnitude of the load
The degree of interference must suit the type 
and magnitude of the load, i.e. the heavier the 
load and the stronger the shock loads, the tighter the interference required († fig. 1).
• Under heavy loads, spherical plain bearings 
deform elastically, which may affect the interference fit and lead to ring creep. 
• The strength of the associated components 
must be adequate to accommodate the loads 
and fully support the bearing.
• If the associated components deform, there is 
a risk that through-hardened bearing rings 
crack.
• Steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings 
require a tighter fit than comparable maintenance-free bearings, which have a lower 
coefficient of friction.
2. Bearing internal clearance
An interference fit on the shaft and in the housing causes the inner ring to expand elastically, 
and the outer ring to be compressed elastically.
This reduces the initial internal clearance in 
the bearing, prior to operation. The operating 
clearance († fig. 2) furthermore takes the load 
and operating temperature into consideration.
The initial radial internal clearance of bearings differs, depending on the type and size of 
the bearing. The clearance has been selected so 
that if the recommended tolerances for the shaft 
and housing seats are applied, an appropriate 
operating clearance (or preload) remains in the 
bearing under normal operating conditions. 
If a tight interference fit is used for both bearing rings, or if the operating temperatures are 
unusual, it may be necessary to use a larger  
initial internal clearance than “Normal” for  
steel/steel bearings.
3. Temperature conditions
In operation, the bearing rings normally have 
a higher temperature than their seats. This 
means that 
• the inner ring fit gets loosen († fig. 3)
• the outer ring fit becomes tighter and may 
restrict any required axial displacement in the 
housing.
If there is a considerable temperature difference 
between the inner ring and outer ring, there is  
a change in the operating clearance. This condition must be considered when selecting the fit 
or the bearing could seize, making it difficult or 
impossible for the shaft to turn.


For heavier loads a tighter interference fit is needed

4. Design of associated components
The bearing seats on the shaft and in the  
housing must not lead to uneven distortion 
(out-of-round) of the bearing rings († fig. 4). 
Therefore:
• Split housings are not suitable for interference fits.
• Thin-walled housings, light alloy housings 
and hollow shafts require a tighter fit than 
thick-walled steel or cast iron housings and 
solid shafts – and must have sufficient 
strength.
• Heavy loads and interference fits require 
thick-walled one-piece steel or cast iron 
housings and solid steel shafts.
71


Design of bearing arrangements
5. Axial displacement of non-locating bearings
A non-locating bearing provides radial support 
only and must always be able to be displaced 
axially († fig. 5). This is normally achieved by 
selecting a loose fit for one of the bearing rings, 
generally the inner ring of a spherical plain 
bearing. Reasons include the following:
• The shaft seat can be easily and economically 
hardened and ground to facilitate axial displacement. The hardness of the shaft should 
be at least 50 HRC. 
• The outer rings of most spherical plain  
bearings are axially fractured at one or two 
positions, or are radially split. This can make 
axial displacement difficult, if not impossible. 
• The housing bore should be protected against 
wear.
Surface finish of seats
The recommended surface roughness for bearing seats is in accordance with ISO 4288:1997.
• for shaft seats Rz ≤ 10 µm
• for housing bore seats Rz ≤ 16 µm
Recommended fits 
Only a limited number of ISO tolerance classes 
are appropriate for spherical plain bearings. 
Fig. 6 shows schematically the relative positions 
of these in relation to the bore and outside 
diameter of the bearings. The recommended 
tolerance classes for 
• the shaft seat are provided in table 1
• the housing bore are provided in table 2
These recommendations are based on the  
considerations described above and have been 
confirmed in a wide variety of bearing applications. The ISO tolerance limits are listed in
• table 3 on page 74 for shafts
• table 4 on page 74 for housing bores
To facilitate the calculation of the minimum and 
maximum values of the theoretical interference 
or clearance, the standardized bearing bore 
diameter deviations (∆dmp) and the bearing outside diameter deviations (∆Dmp) are listed in 
tables 3 and 4.

1) These recommendations do not apply to bearings in the GEG series, which have a bore diameter tolerance class to H7 and are  
normally mounted on shaft seats machined to tolerance class m7. If, for mounting reasons, the shaft is machined to tolerance 
class f7, it should be hardened as movements of the shaft relative to the bearing bore take place and wear may result.

Axial location of bearings
Locating bearings
An interference fit alone is not sufficient to axially 
locate a bearing ring. It is usually necessary to 
use a suitable locking device to secure the ring 
in place.
Both rings of a locating bearing should be 
located axially on both sides. The bearing rings 
generally have an interference fit and are usually 
supported on one side by a shaft or housing 
shoulder. Inner rings are axially secured on the 
opposite end by
• a plate bolted to the shaft end († fig. 7)
• a spacer sleeve between the ring and a neighbouring machine component († fig. 8)
• a retaining ring (circlip)
Outer rings are generally retained by the cover 
of the housing bore († figs. 7 and 8).
Non-locating bearings
For non-locating bearings, the outer ring (which 
normally has a tight fit) is axially located while 
the inner ring is free to move axially on the shaft 
(† fig. 5 on page 72).
Note that for bearings in the GEP series 
(† fig. 9), which have a radially split outer ring, 
expansion forces are produced under purely 
radial load; the axial components of these forces 
act on the housing cover. The axial load acting on 
the cover may be as much as 30% of the radial 
load. This must be taken into account when

Design of bearing arrangements
dimensioning the housing cover and selecting 
the size and number of the attachment bolts. 
If shaft and/or housing shoulders are undesirable because of manufacturing or assembly 
considerations, spacer sleeves or rings can be 
inserted between a bearing ring and an adjacent 
machine component († figs. 10 and 11).
Axially locating a non-separable bearing with 
locating rings († figs. 10 and 11) saves space, 
enables quick mounting and dismounting and 
simplifies the machining of the seats. If larger 
axial forces have to be accommodated, a support ring († fig. 11) should be placed between 
the bearing ring and the locating ring, so that 
the locating ring is not subjected to excessive 
bending moments. 
To locate the bearing, retaining rings (also 
known as circlips) with a constant radial width in 
accordance with DIN 471:1981 or DIN 472:1981 
can be used.

The abutment and fillet dimensions should be 
such that:
• A sufficiently large support surface is available for the bearing ring.
• Moving parts of the bearing arrangement 
cannot contact stationary components.
• The fillet radius should be smaller than the 
chamfer of the bearing.
Appropriate abutment dimensions († fig. 12) 
are provided for each bearing in the product 
tables. The transition from the bearing seat to 
the shaft or housing shoulder can be either a 
simple fillet († fig. 13) or an undercut 
(† fig. 14). Dimensions for ramax and rbmax are 
listed in the product tables. 
Dimensions for undercuts are provided in 
table 5.
The larger the fillet radius (for the simple 
form) of the transition to the shaft shoulder, the 
more favourable is the stress distribution in the 
shaft fillet area.


Design of bearing arrangements 
Location of rod ends
The inner rings of rod ends can be axially located by a shaft shoulder, a nut or a retaining ring.
Rod ends mounted on threaded rods or in 
extension tubes should be secured by an extra 
nut on the rod or the external thread of the rod 
end shank. The nut should be securely tightened 
against the support surface on the rod end 
housing or on the tube († fig. 15).
Fig. 15
Attachment of rod ends


Sealing 
Most bearing arrangements must be sealed to 
prevent contaminants, such as dirt and moisture, from entering the bearing. The efficiency 
of the seal has a decisive influence on the service life of the bearing. In contrast to most other 
bearing types, which only move in one plane, 
the alignment capabilities of spherical plain 
bearings place additional demands on the seal.
To select appropriate seals, several factors 
have to be considered, including:
• the permissible angle of tilt
• the available space
• environmental conditions
• the effectiveness of the seal
• the type of lubricant and the frequency of 
relubrication
• the justifiable cost
Depending on the application, one or more of 
the above factors outweigh the others. It is 
therefore not possible to establish general rules 
for seal design.
Most SKF radial spherical plain bearing series 
are available with integral seals. Standard 
sealed bearings can increase the service life of 
the bearings and save space, while reducing 
SKF integral seals for spherical plain bearings

WARNING!
Some of the external seals listed in this table can be made of fluoro rubber. Note that fluoro rubber gives off dangerous fumes 
at temperatures above 300 °C and can be hazardous if touched. As handling seals made of fluoro rubber constitutes a potential 
safety risk, the safety precautions must always be followed. For detailed information about the safety precautions, refer to the 
SKF Interactive Engineering Catalogue, available online at www.skf.com, the SKF General Catalogue or the publication Industrial 
shaft seals.

Design of bearing arrangements
Designing a bearing 
arrangement for easy 
mounting and dismounting
To facilitate mounting, the shaft ends and housing bores should have a 10 to 20 degree lead-in 
chamfer († fig. 16). This is particularly important for applications using larger bearings, as 
the rings may skew, causing damage to the 
mating surfaces. 
To facilitate the use of withdrawal tools when 
removing bearings, it can be advantageous to:
• provide recesses in the shaft shoulder 
(† fig. 17)
• provide recesses or threaded holes in the 
housing bore († fig. 18)
To dismount larger maintenance-free bearings 
with a bore diameter d ≥ 80 mm that have a 
tight shaft fit, SKF recommends using the oil 
injection method. With the oil injection method, 
oil under high pressure is injected between the 
bearing inner ring and its shaft seat to form an 
oil film. This oil film separates the mating surfaces, greatly reducing the force required to dismount the bearing and virtually eliminating any 
risk of damage to the bearing or shaft.
To use the oil injection method, there must be 
an oil supply duct in the shaft as well as an oil 
distribution groove in the seat († fig. 19). As a 
general rule, the distance between the groove 
and the bearing side face from which mounting 
and dismounting are to be performed should  
be approximately one third of the seat width  
(† fig. 19). Recommended dimensions for the 
ducts and grooves as well as for the threads for 
the oil supply connection are provided in 
tables 8 and 9.

Lubrication
Lubrication
The SKF traffic light concept
Most grease suppliers indicate the specific  
values for the low and high temperature limits 
in their product information. The SKF traffic light 
concept is distinctly different from that. SKF recognizes that the really important temperatures 
for reliable operation lie within a smaller range. 
This range depends largely on the type of base 
oil and thickener used as well as the additives. 
The relevant temperatures are given by the SKF 
traffic light concept. They are schematically 
illustrated in diagrams 1 and 2 in the form of a 
double traffic light. 
It is evident that grease in the red zones 
should not be applied at all, as damage may 
occur. Within the green zone the grease functions reliably, and the grease life can be determined accurately. 
At temperatures in the amber zone above the 
high temperature performance limit (HTPL), 
grease ages and oxidize with increasing rapidity 
and the by-products of the oxidation have a detrimental effect on lubrication. An amber zone 
also exists for low temperatures. Short periods 
in this zone, e.g. during a cold start, are not 
harmful since the heat caused by friction brings 
the bearing temperature into the green zone.

This limit indicates the lowest temperature at which the grease allows the bearing to be started up without difficulty.

Below this limit, the supply of grease to the contact surfaces becomes insufficient.
HTPL – High temperature performance limit
Above this limit, the grease ages and oxidize in an uncontrolled way, so that grease life cannot be determined accurately.

When exceeding this limit, the grease loses its structure permanently.

Lubrication
Relubricating the bearing from the side
Spherical plain bearings 
requiring maintenance
Steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings must 
be relubricated to:
• reduce friction
• reduce wear
• extend bearing service life
• protect against corrosion and contaminants
The sliding contact surfaces are phosphated and 
treated with a “running-in” lubricant. This special surface treatment has a favourable influence during the running-in phase. The bearings 
must be greased prior to use and relubricated 
on a regular basis.
To reliably relubricate the bearings, grease 
ducts should be provided in the housing 
(† fig. 1) or shaft († fig. 2) so that fresh 
grease can be supplied directly to the bearing. 
All SKF steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings 
(with the exception of the smallest E and ESA 
design bearings) have an annular groove and 
lubrication holes in both the inner and outer 
rings to facilitate lubricant distribution to the 
sliding surfaces of the bearing. 
If the arrangement is appropriately designed, 
the bearing can also be supplied with grease 
from the side. To facilitate the passing of grease 
through the bearing, the grease should be prevented from exiting the bearing arrangement 
from the side it is supplied, e.g. by an end cover, 
and to provide an opening for the grease to exit 
on the opposite side, e.g. a V-ring seal that can 
open if there is pressure from the inside 
(† fig. 3).
Generally, where possible, the free space surrounding the bearing should be filled with 
grease.

SKF recommends using SKF LGHB 2 grease 
to lubricate steel/steel spherical plain bearings. 
Its properties include:
• excellent performance under heavy loads
• very good rust inhibitor
• very good resistance to ageing
• good water resistance
• a wide operating temperature range.
If operating temperatures exceed the temperature range limits, special grease should be used 
(† table 1).

application engineering service.

Lubrication
Maintenance-free spherical 
plain bearings
Steel/PTFE sintered bronze and steel/
PTFE fabric sliding contact surface 
combinations 
During operation, PTFE is transferred from the 
dry sliding contact surface of the outer ring to 
the hard chromium plated steel surface of the 
inner ring. Any external lubricant on the sliding 
contact surfaces would disturb this self-lubrication and shorten bearing service life.
As a result, these bearings must not be lubricated and do not have any relubrication facility.
Steel/PTFE FRP sliding contact surface 
combination
Bearings with this sliding contact surface combination are also self-lubricating and can be 
operated grease-free.
However, initial lubrication followed by occasional relubrication of steel/PTFE FRP bearings 
can extend the service life of the bearing by a 
factor of two or more. The inner rings of radial 
bearings or shaft washers of angular contact 
and thrust bearings are coated with a lithium 
base grease before leaving the factory. 
Fig. 4
Relubricating the bearing from the side
If operating conditions are such that protection against corrosion and enhanced sealing are 
required, the free space surrounding the bearing († fig. 4) can be filled with the same grease 
that was used to lubricate the bearing. The 
appropriate time to replenish or renew the 
grease in the bearing arrangement is determined by the operating conditions and the ageing of the grease.
Rust inhibiting, water-repellent lithium base 
greases with a consistency of 2 on the NGLI 
scale should be used. SKF recommends SKF 
LGEP 2 grease († table 1 on page 87). Greases 
containing molybdenum disulphide or other  
solid lubricants should never be used. 
CAUTION: Depending on their design, SKF 
spherical plain bearings are either completely or 
partially coated with an oily preservative or filled 
with grease. Avoid skin contact as these substances may cause skin irritation or an allergic 
reaction.

SAKAC .. M series 
Rod ends requiring 
Steel/steel and steel/bronze rod ends require 
lubrication. To facilitate this:
• All SKF steel/steel rod ends, with the exception of small-sized E and ESA design rod ends, 
can be relubricated via a lubrication hole or 
grease fitting in the rod end housing as well 
as via the pin and the inner ring († fig. 5).
• All SKF steel/bronze rod ends can be 
relubricated via a lubrication hole or grease 
fitting in the rod end housing († fig. 6).
The general recommendations for steel/steel 
radial spherical plain bearings also apply to 
steel/steel rod ends as well as steel/bronze rod 
ends.
For steel/bronze rod ends in the SIKAC .. M and 
SAKAC .. M series, SKF recommends SKF LGMT 3 
grease († table 1 on page 87). Lithium based 
greases with a normal consistency without solid 
lubricant additives can also be used.
Maintenance-free rod ends
Maintenance-free, self-lubricating rod ends are 
designed to be used as dry sliding bearings and 
must not be lubricated. Consequently, these rod 
ends do not have a relubrication facility in their 
housings.
Steel/PTFE FRP rod ends are an exception. 
They can be used without additional lubricant, 
but their service life can be extended appreciably if they are lubricated prior to use.
CAUTION: Depending on their design, SKF rod 
ends are either completely or partially coated 
with an oily preservative or filled with grease. 
Avoid skin contact as these substances may 
cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.
89


Relubrication
Relubrication
To maximize the service life of spherical plain 
bearings and rod ends requiring maintenance, 
they must be relubricated on a regular basis. 
This also applies to maintenance-free bearings 
with a steel/PTFE FRP sliding contact surface. 
Used grease containing wear debris and contaminants should be removed from the contact 
zone and replaced with fresh grease.
Determining the proper relubrication interval 
is extremely important because the attainable 
service life depends on several factors including:
• the magnitude of the load
• the type of load
• the angle of oscillation
• the frequency of oscillation
• the operating temperature
• the sealing arrangement
• other environmental conditions
Long bearing service life can be attained when 
the following basic relubrication rules are 
observed:
• the same type of grease is always used 
(† table 1 on page 87)
• the lubricant is applied at operating 
temperature
• the lubricant is applied before a long  
interruption, e.g. before construction or  
agricultural equipment is stored
Relubrication of non-locating bearings
Non-locating bearings, where axial displacement takes place along the shaft or pin, should 
always be relubricated via the shaft and bearing 
inner ring († fig 2 on page 86). By supplying 
lubricant in this way, grease also enters between 
the mating surfaces of the inner ring and shaft 
seat. This reduces friction and induced axial 
loads when axial displacement occurs.
Storage
SKF spherical plain bearings and rod ends are 
treated with a preservative before they are 
packaged. They can, therefore, be stored in their 
original packages for several years. However, 
the relative humidity in the storeroom should 
not exceed 60%.
NOTE: SKF also supplies a comprehensive 
assortment of greases for various application 
requirements. For additional information, refer 
to the catalogue SKF Maintenance and Lubrication Products or online at www.mapro.skf.com.


SKF has the appropriate greases for 
spherical plain bearings and rod ends, 
including the biologically degradable 
SKF LGGB 2 grease

Mounting
Mounting
Skill and cleanliness when mounting are necessary if spherical plain bearings and rod ends are 
to achieve maximum service life and not fail 
prematurely.
Bearings and rod ends should only be 
removed from their packages immediately  
prior to mounting so that they do not become 
contaminated. Bearing components that could 
have become dirty as a result of improper handling or damaged packaging should be wiped 
clean with a lint-free cloth.
The sliding contact surfaces of spherical  
plain bearings are matched to provide favourable friction and wear characteristics. Therefore, 
any alteration of the sliding surfaces can reduce 
bearing service life. Alterations in this context 
also include washing or exposing the sliding 
surfaces to solvents, cleaners, oils or similar 
media.
All associated components should be clean and 
free of any burrs. Also make sure to check each 
associated component for dimensional accuracy 
before the installation process is started.
Spherical plain bearings
When mounting spherical plain bearings with  
a fractured or split outer ring, it is essential that 
the joint is positioned at 90° to the direction of 
load († fig. 1), otherwise service life is reduced.
Steel or plastic bands that hold together 
spherical plain bearing outer rings must not be 
removed prior to mounting. They are positioned 
in an annular groove and do not protrude from 
the outside diameter surface. 
Spherical plain bearing outer rings that are 
axially split and bolted together must be mounted as such, without loosening the bolts.
Mechanical mounting
The following tools are suitable for mounting 
spherical plain bearings:
• a mounting dolly († fig. 2) or length of tubing; the ring with an interference fit should 
generally be mounted first
• a dolly having two abutment surfaces 
(† fig. 3) for simultaneously mounting the 
bearing on the shaft and in the housing
• for larger numbers of bearings, suitable tools 
can be used in combination with a press 
(† fig. 4)
When mounting spherical plain bearings, consider the following:
• Never use a hammer or pin punch to drive  
a bearing in place, as either could damage the 
rings († fig. 5).
• The mounting force should never be directed 
through the sliding contact surfaces († fig. 6). 
This could damage the sliding contact surfaces 
and/or expand fractured or split bearing outer 
rings, which can cause an increase in the 
mounting force required.

Mounting
Hot mounting
As a rule, larger bearings cannot be mounted 
cold because the force required to press a bearing into position increases considerably with its 
size. Therefore, SKF recommends the following:
• heat the bearing before it is mounted on the 
shaft († fig. 7)
• heat non-split housings before inserting the 
bearing
To mount a bearing on a shaft, a temperature 
differential of 60 to 80 °C between ambient 
temperature and the heated inner ring, is usually sufficient. For housings, the appropriate differential depends on the degree of interference 
and the seat diameter. However, a moderate 
WARNING!
Maintenance-free spherical plain bearings 
and rod ends must never be subjected to 
temperatures in excess of +280 °C due to 
the PTFE content. PTFE is completely inert 
below this temperature but at higher temperatures (from approx. 320 °C) it rapidly 
decomposes. The fluorine compounds 
released during this process are extremely 
toxic, even in small quantities, and can cause 
serious injury. It should also be remembered 
that the material is dangerous to handle 
once it has been overheated, even after it 
has cooled.
Heat-resistant gloves should be worn 
when handling hot components.
Fig. 7

Mounting a heated large bearing
increase in temperature is usually sufficient. 
When heating the bearing, do not exceed the 
temperature limit of any associated components, such as the seals.
For an even and risk-free heat source, an 
induction heater should be used. The use of an 
SKF induction heater has a number of advantages. It heats the bearing rapidly and a built-in 
thermostat prevents overheating. The non-metallic components, such as the seals or PTFE 
fabric, remain cold as does the heater itself. SKF 
induction heaters automatically demagnetize 
the bearing after it has been heated.
Mounting bearings by cooling the shaft or the 
bearing is not recommended, as the very low 
temperatures required inevitably cause condensation, thus creating the risk of corrosion.
To ease the mounting of large bearings, particularly if they have been heated, it is possible 
to use slings and a hoist. Metal or textile slings 
placed around the outer ring can be used. A 
spring between the hoist hook and the sling also 
facilitates bearing handling († fig. 8). 


Fig. 9
Securing a rod end with a right-hand thread
Rod ends
Rod ends are fitted on pins and shafts in the 
same way as spherical plain bearings. Slight 
heating reduces the force required for mounting 
and reduce the risk of damaging associated 
components.
When attaching rod ends to threaded rods or 
extension tubes († fig. 9) a counter lock nut 
should be used on the rod or on the external 
thread of the rod end. It should be securely 
tightened against the abutment surface on the 
rod end or tube.
NOTE: SKF supplies a comprehensive range  
of mechanical and hydraulic tools as well as 
heating equipment for bearing mounting and 
dismounting. For additional information, refer to 
the catalogue SKF Mainten ance and Lubrication 
Products or online at www.mapro.skf.com.


Dismounting
Dismounting
Spherical plain bearings
If bearings are to be re-used after dismounting, 
the same care and attention are required during 
dismounting as when mounting. The requisite 
withdrawal force should always be applied to the 
ring which is being dismounted.
SKF offers an assortment of different pullers 
to accommodate many applications. If the shaft 
is pre-machined to accommodate the arms of a 
jaw puller, then a two- or three-armed puller 
can be used († fig. 1).
In other cases where there is enough space 
behind the ring, a strong back puller such as the 
SKF TMBS series can be used († fig. 2).
For large bearings with an interference fit, 
dismounting is considerably facilitated if the SKF 
oil injection method is used († fig. 3). The oil 
ducts and distributor grooves should be provided when designing the bearing arrangement 
(† page 82).
Small bearings can be dismounted using a 
mounting dolly or a length of tubing applied to 
the outer ring. For larger bearings with an interference fit, a mechanical or hydraulic press 
should be used when possible.
It is also possible to dismount a bearing from 
the housing bore by quickly heating the housing 
without heating the bearing outer ring to any 
extent.
Rod ends
To dismount rod ends, the lock nut securing the 
shank should be loosened and, if possible, the 
rod end should be unscrewed from its rod or 
tube. The rod end can then be removed from the 
pin or shaft in the same way as a bearing, e.g. 
using a puller or a press.

Radial spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance
Spherical plain bearing with the multi-groove system, 
fitted with LS heavy-duty seals
A characteristic feature of SKF steel/steel radial 
spherical plain bearings is the outer ring, which 
is intentionally fractured so that it can be sprung 
apart to enable the inner ring to be inserted 
(† fig. 1). The bearings are therefore non- 
separable and easy to handle.
The bearings are manganese phosphated and 
the sliding contact surface is then treated with  
a running-in lubricant. This reduces friction and 
wear during the running-in period. To facilitate 
lubrication, all bearings, with the exception of 
some small sizes, have an annular groove and 
two lubrication holes in both the inner and  
outer rings. Metric bearings with an outside 
diameter D ≥ 150 mm also have the SKF multigroove system († page 17) in the outer ring 
sliding contact surface as standard († fig. 2). 
Upon request, SKF can also supply smaller  
metric and inch size bearings with the multigroove system.
With the multi-groove system, SKF solved  
the problem of lubricant starvation in steel/steel 
bearings. Lubricant starvation is a common 
cause of premature bearing failure in applications where minor alignment movements are 
made under heavy, constant direction loads.
The multi-groove system improves lubricant 
distribution in the heavily loaded zone to extend 
bearing service life and/or maintenance 
intervals.
The dimensions of spherical plain bearings in 
the GE, GEH and GEG series are in accordance 
with ISO 12240-1:1998.
Bearings in the GEM series, which have an 
extended inner ring, have a non-standard inner 
ring width, but otherwise have the same dimensions as GE series bearings.
Inch spherical plain bearings in the GEZ series 
are in accordance with the American Standard 
ANSI/ABMA Std. 22.2-1988.
The fractured outer ring enables the bearing to be 
assembled

Tolerances
The dimensional tolerances for metric radial 
spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance 
in the GE, GEG, GEH and GEM series are listed in 
table 1. The dimensional tolerances for inch 
radial spherical plain bearings in the GEZ,  
GEZH and GEZM series are listed in table 2 on 
page 103. Outer ring tolerances apply to conditions before fracture and surface treatment. 
Accordingly, inner ring tolerances apply to rings 
before surface treatment.
The tolerances are in accordance with 
ISO 12240-1:1998 (metric bearings) and 
ANSI/ABMA Std. 22.2-1988 (inch bearings).

Radial spherical plain bearings requiring maintenance
Radial internal clearance 
Steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings are 
produced with Normal radial internal clearance  
as standard. The actual values are listed in 
tables 3 and 4. Prior to ordering, check availability 
of bearings with a smaller (C2) or larger (C3) 
radial internal clearance than Normal.
The clearance values for metric bearings are 
in accordance with ISO 12240-1:1998.
Materials
The inner and outer rings of SKF steel/steel 
radial spherical plain bearings are made of 
bearing steel. They are through-hardened, 
ground and phosphated. The sliding contact 
surfaces are treated with a running-in lubricant. 
Depending on the bore diameter, metric 
bearings with a 2RS suffix have a double-lip 
seal made of a polyester elastomer or acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber on both sides of the 
bearing († table 6 on page 79). Inch bearings 
with a 2RS suffix have a double-lip seal made of 
polyurethane on both sides of the bearing.
Metric and inch bearings with the designation 
suffix -2LS have a sheet steel reinforced,  
triple-lip heavy-duty seal made of acrylonitrilebutadiene on both sides of the bearing.
Permissible operating temperature 
range
Open steel/steel radial spherical plain bearings 
have a permissible operating temperature range 
of –50 to +200 °C, but their load carrying capacity is reduced at temperatures above +120 °C. 
Bearings for higher temperature applications up 
to 300 °C, can be produced on request.
For sealed bearings, the permissible operating temperature range is limited by the seal 
material:
• –20 to +80 °C for inch RS seals
• –30 to +130 °C for metric RS seals with a 
bore diameter d < 320 mm
• –35 to +100 °C for metric RS seals with a 
bore diameter d ≥ 320 mm 
• –55 to +110 °C for LS seals
The operating temperature range of the grease 
used to lubricate the bearings must also be taken 
into consideration.

Maintenance-free radial 
spherical plain bearings


Maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings
SKF manufactures maintenance-free radial 
spherical plain bearings in a variety of designs 
and a wide range of sizes. Three sliding contact 
surface combinations are available:
• Steel/PTFE sintered bronze, designation  
suffix C
• Steel/PTFE fabric, designation suffix TX
• Steel/PTFE FRP, designation suffix F
All three sliding contact surface combinations 
are self-lubricating. Bearings with a steel/PTFE 
sintered bronze or steel/PTFE fabric sliding  
contact surface combinations must not be lubricated. Bearings with a steel/PTFE FRP (fibre 
reinforced polymer) sliding contact surface 
combination are also maintenance-free; however, occasional relubrication is beneficial to 
help maximize bearing service life. To facilitate 
relubrication, steel/PTFE FRP bearings are 
equipped with lubrication facilities. 
The different designs of SKF maintenancefree radial spherical plain bearings are listed in 
table 3 on pages 128 to 129. Their design 
depends on the size and series, with the main 
differences being the material or the design of 
the outer ring.
The dimensions of metric maintenance-free 
radial spherical plain bearings are in accordance 
with ISO 12240-1:1998. The dimensions of 
inch bearings in the GEZ series are in accordance with ANSI/ABMA Std. 22.2-1988.
Tolerances
The dimensional tolerances for metric maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings are in 
accordance with ISO 12240-1:1998 and listed 
in table 1.
The dimensional tolerances for inch bearings 
in the GEZ series are in accordance with ANSI/
ABMA Std. 22.2-1988 and listed in table 2. The 
symbols used are explained in the following:
nominal bore diameter
Ddmp deviation of the mean bore diameter from 
the nominal
nominal outside diameter
DDmp deviation of the mean outside diameter 
DBs deviation of the single inner ring width 
DCs deviation of the single outer ring width 
For the TX and TXG3 designs, outer ring tolerances apply to dimensions before fracture.

Radial internal clearance, preload
Maintenance-free radial spherical plain  
bearings with a bore diameter d ≤ 90 mm either 
have an internal clearance or a slight preload 
(negative clearance) depending on their design. 
Therefore, these bearings can only be provided 
with an upper limit for bearing internal clearance. The lower limit must be assessed by the 
frictional moment, resulting from the preload 
(negative clearance).
The radial internal clearance and the upper 
limit of the permissible frictional moment of 
bearings with a steel/PTFE sintered bronze  
sliding contact surface are listed in table 4. The 
values for the clearance limits of bearings with  
a steel/PTFE fabric and a steel/PTFE FRP sliding 
contact surface combination are listed in 
tables 5 to 8.

1) Bearings in the GEH .. TX.. series with a bore diameter 
d = 90 mm have a radial clearance corresponding to the 
values quoted for the next larger diameter.
Materials
The materials for the inner ring, outer ring, sliding layer and seals, where applicable, are listed 
in table 3 on pages 128 to 129.
Permissible operating temperature 
range
The permissible operating temperature range 
of maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings depends on the sliding contact surface 
combination and the material of the seals 
(† table 3 on pages 128 to 129). However, if  
the load carrying capacity of the bearings is to 
be fully exploited, the temperature range must 
be narrowed. Depending on the application, it is 
possible to operate at temperatures above the 
upper limit for brief periods. For additional 
information, contact the SKF application  
engineering service.

4.1 Maintenance-free angular contact spherical plain bearings, steel/PTFE FRP .................... 
Angular contact spherical 
plain bearings
151


Angular contact spherical plain bearings
As their name implies, the sliding contact surfaces of angular contact spherical plain bearings 
are spherical in shape and inclined at an angle to 
the bearing axis († fig. 1). Consequently, these 
bearings are well suited for accommodating 
combined (radial and axial) loads. Single angular 
contact spherical plain bearings can only 
accommodate axial loads acting in one direction. 
These bearings can be separated, enabling the 
rings to be mounted separately.
SKF manufactures steel/PTFE FRP (fibre 
reinforced polymer containing PTFE) maintenance-free angular contact spherical plain  
bearings as standard. Designs with other sliding 
surface combinations are available on request 
(† Special designs, starting on page 154).
The boundary dimensions of SKF angular contact spherical plain bearings are in accordance 
with ISO 12240-2:1998.
Tolerances
The dimensional tolerances for SKF angular 
contact spherical plain bearings are listed  
in table 1 and are in accordance with 
ISO 12240-2:1998.
The symbols used in the tolerance table are 
explained in the following: 
nominal bore diameter
Ddmp deviation of the mean bore diameter from 
the nominal
nominal outside diameter
DDmp deviation of the mean outside diameter 
DBs deviation of the single inner ring width 
DCs deviation of the single outer ring width

bearing
Angular contact spherical plain bearings, back-to-back 
arrangement
Angular contact spherical plain bearings, face-to-face

Radial internal clearance, preload
The internal clearance of a single angular  
contact spherical plain bearing is only obtained 
after mounting and depends on the adjustment 
against a second bearing that provides axial 
location in the opposite direction. Angular  
contact spherical plain bearings are generally 
mounted as pairs in a back-to-back († fig. 2) 
or face-to-face arrangement († fig. 3). The 
bearings are adjusted against each other by  
axially displacing one bearing ring until a specific bearing load of 10 N/mm2 is obtained. The 
preload prevents some of the deformations that 
typically occur under load and after a brief running-in period. When adjusting a new bearing 
arrangement for the first time, the specific 
bearing load of 10 N/mm2 is achieved when the 
frictional moment and the axial preload force 
are in the ranges listed in table 2. 
153


Angular contact spherical plain bearings
Materials
The inner and outer rings of SKF angular  
contact spherical plain bearings are made of 
bearing steel that has been through-hardened 
and ground. The sliding layer of fibre reinforced 
polymer, containing PTFE, is injection moulded 
onto the outer ring († fig. 4). The sliding surface of the inner ring is hard chromium plated 
and coated with a lithium base grease.
Permissible operating temperature 
range
Spherical plain bearings with a steel/PTFE FRP 
sliding contact surface combination can be used 
for operating temperatures ranging from –40  
to +75 °C. For brief periods, temperatures up to 
110 °C can be tolerated. However, keep in mind 
that the load carrying capacity of the bearing is 
reduced at temperatures that exceed 50 °C. For 
additional information, contact the SKF 
application engineering service.
Special designs
Special operating conditions may require angular contact spherical plain bearings with a steel/
PTFE fabric or steel/steel sliding contact surface 
combination. These bearings are available on 
request.
Bearings with a maintenance-free steel/PTFE 
fabric sliding contact surface combination 
(† fig. 5) should be used when lubricant-free 
operation is specified. These bearings can 
accommodate heavy loads, preferably in a constant direction.
Steel/steel bearings († fig. 6) are typically 
used in applications where operating temperatures or load frequencies are high, or where 
heavy or shock loads occur. To operate properly, 
steel/steel bearings must be provided with an 
adequate supply of lubricant. Depending on the 
operating conditions, the sliding surface of the 
outer ring may be equipped with various multigroove patterns († figs. 7 and 8). For additional information, contact the SKF application engineering service.
Upon request, inch steel/steel angular contact 
spherical plain bearings are also available as 
double direction angular contact spherical plain 
bearings. Double direction bearings can be used 
instead of two angular contact bearings in a 
face-to face arrangement, or as a high capacity

outer rings. The shim simplifies installation and 
optimizes axial internal clearance within the 
bearing († fig. 9).

Thrust spherical plain 
bearings
159


Thrust spherical plain bearings
Thrust spherical plain bearings have a convex 
spherical surface on the shaft washer and a  
corresponding concave spherical surface in the 
housing washer († fig. 1). They are intended to 
accommodate primarily axial loads but can also 
accommodate combined (radial and axial) loads. 
The radial load component of a combined load 
should not exceed 50% of the axial load component. When radial loads are larger, it is advisable 
to combine thrust bearings with radial bearings 
in the GE dimension series († fig. 2). Thrust 
spherical plain bearings are separable, e.g. shaft 
and housing washers can be mounted 
separately. 
SKF manufactures thrust spherical plain 
bearings with the maintenance-free steel/
PTFE FRP (fibre reinforced polymer containing 
PTFE) sliding contact surface combination as 
standard. Other sliding surface combinations 
are available on request († Special designs, 
page 162).
The principal dimensions of SKF thrust  
spherical plain bearings are in accordance  
with ISO 12240-3:1998.
Tolerances
The dimensional tolerances for SKF thrust 
spherical plain bearings are listed in table 1 and 
are in accordance with ISO 12240-3:1998.
The symbols used in the tolerance table are 
explained in the following:

Rod ends requiring maintenance
SKF manufactures rod ends requiring maintenance with a steel/steel or a steel/bronze sliding 
contact surface combination.
Steel/steel rod ends consist of a rod end 
housing and a steel/steel radial spherical plain 
bearing from the standard assortment, where 
the outer ring is secured in the housing. These 
rod ends are available with a female thread 
(† fig. 1), male thread († fig. 2) or a welding 
shank († fig. 3).
Steel/bronze rod ends consist of a rod end 
housing and a steel/bronze spherical plain bearing. These bearings have an inner ring made of 
steel and an outer ring made of bronze. The 
bearing is held in position by staking the housing on both sides of the outer ring. These rod 
ends are available with a male or female thread.
SKF supplies rod ends with a threaded shank 
with a right-hand thread as standard. With the 
exception of rod ends with the designation suffix 
VZ019, all rod ends are also available with a 
left-hand thread. They are identified by the designation prefix L.
The dimensions of SKF rod ends requiring 
maintenance are in accordance with the standards listed in table 1. 
Male and female threads of SKF rod ends are 
in accordance with ISO 965-1:1998, except for 
rod ends with female thread having the designation suffix /VZ019, which is in accordance 
with ISO 8139:2009.
Tolerances
SKF rod end inner ring dimensional tolerances 
are in accordance with ISO 12240-4:1998. The 
tolerances for the steel/steel rod end inner rings 
are listed in table 3 and the tolerances for steel/
bronze rod end inner rings are listed in table 2.
The symbols used in these tables are 
explained in the following:

Rod ends requiring maintenance
Permissible  
operating temperature range
The permissible operating temperature range 
for SKF rod ends requiring maintenance 
depends on the rod end housing, the bearing, 
the bearing seals and the grease used for lubrication. The values for the permissible operating 
temperature range are listed in table 7.

The load carrying capacity of the rod end is 
reduced at temperatures above 100 °C. For 
temperatures below 0 °C, check to be sure that 
the fracture toughness of the rod end housing is 
adequate for the intended application.
SKF reserves the right to use similar material or material of higher strength.


Fatigue strength
In all applications where a rod end is subjected 
to alternating loads, loads that vary in magnitude or where failure of a rod end is dangerous, 
make sure that the selected rod end has sufficient fatigue strength. 
Relubrication facilities
SKF rod ends requiring maintenance are provided with a grease fitting or a lubrication hole 
in the rod end housing. Relubrication via the pin 
is also possible. Exceptions are steel/steel rod 
ends in the SA .. E and SI .. E series and a few 
smaller rod ends as indicated in the product 
tables. The type and design of relubrication 
facilities in the rod end housing are listed in 
table 8.

Maintenance-free rod ends
SKF manufactures maintenance-free rod ends 
with three different sliding contact surface combinations in different series:
• Steel/PTFE sintered bronze († fig. 1): 
– SI(L) .. C series 
– SA(L) .. C series
• Steel/PTFE fabric († fig. 2): 
– SI(L) .. TXE-2LS series 
– SI(L)A .. TXE-2LS series 
– SA(L) .. TXE-2LS series 
– SA(L)A .. TXE-2LS series
• Steel/PTFE FRP († fig. 3): 
– SI(L)KB .. F series 
– SA(L)KB .. F series
Rod ends with either a steel/PTFE sintered 
bronze or steel/PTFE fabric sliding contact surface combination contain a bearing from the 
standard assortment. The outer ring is staked in 
place in the housing.
Rod ends with a steel/PTFE FRP sliding contact surface combination consist of a rod end 
housing and a spherical plain bearing inner ring. 
Between the housing and the inner ring, a sliding layer of fibre reinforced polymer, containing 
PTFE, is moulded to the housing.
SKF supplies maintenance-free rod ends with 
a threaded shank with a right-hand thread as 
standard. With the exception of rod ends with 
the designation suffix VZ019, all rod ends are 
also available with a left-hand thread. They are 
identified by the designation prefix L.
The dimensions of SKF maintenance-free rod 
ends are in accordance with ISO 12240-4:1998.
Male and female threads of SKF rod ends are 
in accordance with ISO 965-1:1998, except for 
rod ends with female thread having the designation suffix /VZ019, which is in accordance 
with ISO 8139:2009.

Tolerances
SKF rod end inner ring dimensional tolerances 
are in accordance with ISO 12240-1:1998. The 
tolerances are listed in table 1.
The symbols used in table 1 are explained in 
the following: 
nominal bore diameter
Ddmp deviation of the mean bore diameter from 
the nominal
DBs deviation of the single inner ring width 
Radial internal clearance, preload
Depending on their design, SKF maintenancefree rod ends may have a radial internal clearance or a light preload. Table 2 lists maximum 
values for the radial internal clearance as well as 
for the frictional moment in the circumferential 
direction caused by preload.

Maintenance-free rod ends
Materials
SKF rod end housings for maintenance-free 
bearings are made of materials as listed in 
table 3.
Details of the materials used for the maintenance-free radial spherical plain bearings incorporated in the rod ends are listed in table 3 on 
pages 128 to 129.
The inner ring of rod ends with a steel/PTFE 
FRP sliding contact surface combination is made 
of bearing steel. The ring is through-hardened 
and ground. The sliding contact surface of the 
inner ring is hard chromium plated. The sliding 
layer consists of a fibre reinforced polymer, containing PTFE. 
Permissible operating temperature 
range
The permissible operating temperature range 
for SKF maintenance-free rod ends depends on 
the rod end housing, the incorporated bearing 
and the bearing seals. The values for the permissible operating temperature range are listed 
in table 4.
The load carrying capacity of the rod end is 
reduced at temperatures above 100 °C. For 
temperatures below 0 °C, check to be sure that 
the fracture toughness of the rod end housing is 
adequate for the intended application.
Fatigue strength
In all applications where a rod end is subjected 
to alternating loads, loads that vary in magnitude or where failure of a rod end is dangerous, 
make sure that the selected rod end has sufficient fatigue strength.

Other SKF plain bearings and special solutions
Spherical plain bearings for road 
vehicles
SKF spherical plain bearings or bearing units
are also available for special applications. Therefore, SKF works closely with the customer to 
develop customized products, e.g. solutions for 
centring propeller shafts or gear shifts.
Plain bearings for railway vehicles
The SKF assortment of plain bearings for railway vehicles includes bogie swivel bearings for 
trams and heavy-duty goods wagons as well as 
spherical plain bearings and rod ends for transverse stabilizers, tilting mechanisms etc.
Bushing units for off-highway vehicles
Many off-highway vehicles have bushings made 
of steel or bronze that require relubrication. SKF 
has developed state-of-the-art bushing units 
with seals. As these units do not require grease, 
costs are reduced and product ivity is increased.

Spherical plain bearings and rod ends 
for the aircraft industry
SKF supplies a wide assortment of special 
spherical plain bearings and rod ends in various 
designs and materials for aerospace applications worldwide. The main applications are airframe bearings for the transmission of rotating, 
tilting and oscillating movements as used in 
undercarriages, spoilers, height and side  
rudders, wing flaps etc. 
Bushings, thrust washers and strips
SKF offers a wide assortment of bushings available from stock. Bushings are suitable for rotating, oscillating and linear movements and are 
available as cylindrical or flanged designs. 
Thrust washers are intended for applications 
where axial space is limited, maintenance is not 
possible and where lubricant starvation can 
occur.
SKF also supplies strips made of the same 
materials as thrust washers. They can be bent, 
pressed or coined to form flat linear guides, e.g. 
L-shaped or V-shaped profiles, or other types  
of dry sliding components.
Different materials meet different 
requirements:
• solid bronze, the traditional robust material
• sintered bronze with oil impregnation,  
for high sliding velocities
• wrapped bronze with lubrication pockets,  
for contaminated environments
• PTFE composite with reduced friction,  
for long service life
• POM composite, for minimal maintenance  
under arduous conditions
• PTFE polyamide, cost-effective and  
maintenance-free
• filament wound, for extreme conditions

Other SKF plain bearings and special solutions
Rod ends for the food industry
The food and beverage processing industries 
have unique requirements. Depending on the 
application, equipment has to withstand the  
following influences: 
• hot, cold or wet environments 
• frequent wash downs
• exposure to harsh cleaning agents
• food and liquid contaminants
• a variety of chemicals
To deal with these challenging operating conditions, SKF offers rod ends with a stainless steel 
housing or with a composite housing. Both 
series are equipped with a stainless steel inner 
ring and an injection moulded PTFE FRP dry 
sliding layer. The used materials provide the  
following properties: 
• corrosion resistant
• good wear resistance
• low friction
• cost-effective
