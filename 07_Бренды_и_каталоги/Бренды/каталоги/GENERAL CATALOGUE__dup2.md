Bearing ring grinding and superfinishing are part and parcel of comprehensive cycle of operation for all ring surfaces.
These operations require special high quality C. N. C. grinding machines
and inspection equipment.
The Technologies...


All machines, inspection equipment 
and 
manufacturing
processes satisfy the most stringent and up-to-date requirements, vital for manufacturing
high quality precision products.
Rings are manufactured from
bar or forged tube.  The common element is the raw material used, 100Cr6 steel, which
must be high quality and inclusion free.
In high precision applications it is the
quality and operation and performance of SNFA bearings which
stands out.
This is true for all of the SNFA Group
Companies whose production combines to offer a wide range of bearings for high precision and aerospace
applications.
Design, testing, manufacturing and
inspection are given all the resources
and facilities necessary to satisfy the
ever increasing demands of technologically advanced bearings.


Matching is the operation whereby groups
of two or more bearings are formed to
achieve the required preload.
Precise and uniform preload gives consistent
operation between bearing sets.
SNFA uses special equipment to achieve this,
the application of required preload and the
corresponding reading of bearing surface
clearance needing to be very strictly controlled.
…the technologies…


Cotton fabric reinforced phenolic resin
cages are machined from tube.
Good dynamic behaviour of this vital
bearing component depends on raw
material homogeneity and exact
geometry being obtained during manufacture.
Rings are finally inspected 100%.
Specially designed computer-controlled equipment performs automatic and simultaneous measurement of all ring geometrical parameters to a high degree of precision.
The results are stored for later
quality analysis.
On assembly the parts come
together to form the completed
bearing. At this stage special  care
is needed to ensure that the
rolling surfaces are not damaged.
Assembly of preselected components using induction equipment
ensures controlled heating bearing outer ring expansion and ease
of assembly.


… the 
technologies.
Cleanliness is essential to guarantee bearing life.
Washing requires the use of special machinery
equipment and fluids.
Marking ensures complete product identification. Codes identify the basic bearing type, its
degree of precision contact angle and type of
pairing.
Computer controlled laser marking equipment
is used.
Before shipment to their final
destination finished bearings are
stored in a controlled temperature and humidity environment.


ISO 9002-Cert. n°0026/1
Design of new bearing series uses sophisticated
computer programs backed up by rig testing.
This activity is performed in line with the criteria
of Quality Assurance Standard ISO 9000.
Production development must be supported by
experimentation.
Ongoing functional tests at SNFA laboratories are
targeted at finding new innovative solutions for
the benefit of our customers.
Customer Service
The experience of SNFA’s technical offices is at
the customers disposal for optimum bearing
selection, starting at the design stage.

Bearing configuration
Due to their internal design, angular contact ball bearings can withstand high radial - axial loads and
reach high speeds.
They are asymmetrical for manufacturing reasons and can withstand uni-direction axial loads only.
They cannot be used on their own.
Angular bearings are mounted in groups of two or more opposed pre-loaded units with rigid or elastic spacers.
Their asymmetrical shape permits installation of a one-piece cage with a large number of balls, thus
ensuring high load capacity and rigidity.
The various SNFA bearing configurations are grouped in series, for easy product identification and
selection according to application requirements.

Materials
Inner and outer races and balls
SNFA bearings are manufactured in SAE 52100 (ISO
100 Cr 6) chrome steel, this being a particularly clean
material offering high reliability.
It is hardened and tempered to a process which allows
safe operation up to 150 °C.
Where the operating conditions are severe, bearings
may have ceramic  balls (see NS bearings).
Cage
SNFA design cages to be of low weight and with low
friction suitable for operation at high speed.
The most commonly used material is cotton reinforced
phenolic resin.
Some bearing series are equipped with glass fibre
reinforced polyamide cages.
Brass or Aluminium cages are available for special
applications on request.

Contact Angle
In practice, the following may affect the bearing contact angle at critical operating
speeds and temperature conditions:
. high interference fitting of races
. temperature differential between the outer and inner races
. centrifugal force effects on the balls and rotating race
Neglecting these possible problems could lead to rapid bearing failure.
Where there is concern about contact angle changes, SNFA will analyse the situation
using the most up to date methods.
The choice of the contact angle requires careful application analysis keeping in mind at
all times the final performance requirements.

Limiting Speed
Angular contact ball bearings feature the highest rotational speed capabilities of all precision bearings.
The speeds illustrated in the SNFA catalogue indicate the limit at which bearings can operate continuously, at a safe, constant  temperature (thermal reference speed).
This temperature varies according to the type of lubricant used. Limiting temperature for grease lubricated bearings is lower than for oil because of greater lubricant deterioration.
Limiting speed for a grease lubrication is consequently about 65% of the value achievable with oil .
To ensure high reliability, the temperature limits referred to in setting SNFA bearing speeds are lower
than those commonly used for standard non-precision bearings to ensure high reliability.
Bearing limiting speeds depend on their class, series and internal configuration.
The following are further elements that influence bearing limit speed:
- preload, which affects operating temperature directly
- precision
- composition of the set and type of mounting: Face-to-face arrangement (FF; TF, 3TF, TFT)
has a lower speed limit.
- contact angle
The maximum speeds indicated in the Data Table refer to ABEC 7 precision class, oil lubrication, individual and matched bearings.
Series VEB and VEX are an exception to this, as they refer to class ABEC 9.
The correction factors indicated below are applied for calculating bearing speed in other 
variants not listed in the table.
Achievement of maximum speed is of course affected by correct assembly of the bearings in their
application.
The following must therefore be provided:
- housing and spindle components and bearing seats within suitable tolerance limits (Cf. Assembly
Tolerances)
- proper dynamic balancing of rotating parts
- efficient lubrication

Bearing Operating Temperature
Maximum allowable operating temperature for angular contact precision ball bearings
corresponds to the limiting value below which no geometrical and structural changes
occur. This value depends on material and relevant heat treatment adopted.
SNFA bearing rings are stabilised to attain a temperature 150° C; stratified textile - resin
or polyamide cages can attain a maximum temperature 120°C. 
During operation, the internal bearing temperature is much higher than that measured
by probes placed close to the rings.
This situation is particularly critical in the case of rigidy preloaded bearings operating at
high speed since dangerous local overheating at the ball to race contact area can occur.
This event, that leads to bearing seizure, can be avoided by ensuring that the temperature measured by the probe is well below the values indicated above. In the case of
grease lubricated bearings, the situation is already critical when the temperature of the
outer and/or inner ring is over 55 °C, as the grease deteriorates rapidly.
Temperature limits are much higher with oil lubrication and depend on the lubrication
system used.


Vibration and Noise
The vibration and noise level of a bearing expresses component quality and bearing cleanliness.
SNFA bearings are inspected during final manufacturing stage with special three-frequency band test
equipment to get further confirmation of the quality requirements.
This equipment also permits vibration analysis on frequency spectra to analyse the behaviour of each
bearing component.
Typical bearing frequencies are closely correlated to their design and can be calculated with the following formulae:
BPFO: Frequency of ball passing over the outer ring.
BPFI:
Frequency of ball passing over the inner ring.
BSF: 
Frequency of ball rotation about its axis.
FTF: 
Frequency of cage rotation.
where  “f” is the frequency, in Hz, of the relative bearing ring rotation.
Control Noise and Vibration
This operation, which is undertaken at
the customer’s request or if the bearings normally run at high speed (ie
high ndm levels) checks that the bearing runs correctly.
This machine measures noise levels
over three frequency bands and analyses the result using Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) to give an indication
of the bearing’s dynamic behavour.

Dynamic Load Coefficient C33 and 
Theoretical Life Calculation L10
Foreword
Bearing life is defined as the number of revolutions or operating hours a bearing
may accumulate before the first signs of defects appear.
If damage caused by major defects or errors are excluded, the commonest bearing
failure modules are wear, seizing, permanent deformation, overheating and material fatigue caused by cyclical work stress with spalling.
These complex phenomena are often interdependent and no sure calculation models exist to use as a reference for their assessment. An exception is failure due to
race material fatigue on which a theory does exist, together with the calculation
method of ISO Standard 281 which derives from that theory.
The most frequent cause of bearing failure in high rotation speed applications,
such as high frequency electrical spindles for instance, is not race fatigue but overheating and seizure.
This means assigning priority to design factors improving bearing performance at
high speed, such as reducing power loss, better lubrication and cooling even at the
expense of bearing load carrying capacity.
Bearings must be checked at the design stage as suitable for supporting work
loads without evidencing signs of fatigue, by calculating theoretical life L10 to ISO
Standard 281.


Calculation
ISO Standard 281 specifies that the theoretical life of a group of identical type ball bearings with the
same contact angle is to be calculated with the following formulae:
L10
=   
K · C33
Pe 
(Million rpm)
 L10 · 10 6 
L10h =
 60 · n 
(hours)
were :
L10
Basic life, in millions of revolutions, with 10% failure probability (90% survival).
L10h
Basic life in hours, with 10% failure probability (90% survival).
Radial or axial dynamic load capacity with 1 million of revolutions life and 10% failure probability (90% survival);
ISO 281 specifies a formula for calculating C33 for quality steel ring bearings, relative to bea
ing internal geometry. These values are given in the bearing data table.
K   
Additional load capacity coefficient for a group of “i” bearings: k = i 0.7
Pe       Equivalent dynamic load in daN;
This load has the same effect of axial load Fa and radial load Fr effectively 
acting on the
group of “i” bearings.
Fa 
Axial load acting on the bearing group (daN). 
Fr       Radial load acting on the bearing group (daN). 
n
Rotation speed (rpm).


Notes:
ISO Standard 281 gives the method for calculating capacity (K.C33) of a
group of identical bearings when a support consists of different load and
pre-load bearings, so the fraction of load acting on load and pre-load bearings must be assessed and the life of both groups calculated separately.
Basic lives L10 and L10h depend on working loads and speeds as well as on
bearing design. ISO 281 mentions the possibility of assessing lives that take
account of other parameters. Such lives, called corrected and coded L10a
and L10ha respectively, are obtained by multiplying basic lives by suitable
correction factors “a” that take account of:
- lubricant viscosity and cleanliness
- steel cleanliness
- ultimate bearing steel fatigue resistance.
These calculations can entail difficulties due to data uncertainty. Should the
effects of these factors require to be assessed, SNFA Technical Department
should be contacted.
The ISO 281 calculation method holds true for steel ball bearings and for
rotation speeds where centrifugal forces on the balls are negligible compared with work loads. Should this not be the case, a sophisticated computer program based on the same fatigue-induced failure theory as ISO
Standard 281 is available at the SNFA Technical Department 


Calculation of Equivalent Dynamic Load Pe 
( ISO Standard 281 )
The values of the equivalent dynamic load is defined by the following formula:
Pe = XFr + YFa
(daN)
The values of X and Y are shown in table below.
Note: in the case of a set of preloaded bearings:
1) if the support is subjected solely to a radial load, the axial load is equal to the preload
Fa = Pr                (daN)
2) if the support is subjected to a combined external load, radial and axial:
- if the group is rigidly preloaded:
a) with external Fa not exceeding 3 Pr use Fa = 2/3 Fa external + Pr
b) with external Fa greater than 3 Pr use Fa = Fa external
- if the bearings are preloaded by springs:
Fa = Fa external +  Pr springs

Static Load Coefficient Co and Bearing Static Check
Static Load Coefficient Co
Static Load Coefficient Co is used to check whether a static or very slowly rotating bearing can withstand undamaged short bursts of high loads as can be caused by impacts or manoeuvres.
This coefficient is used in machine tools for instance, to check whether spindle bearings can withstand the loads generated by tool holder removal operations.
ISO Specification 76-1987 defines coefficient Co as the static load corresponding to 420 daN/mm2
in the contact area between the most loaded ball and the race. Stress equal to or in excess of this
amount cause permanent deformation in angular contact ball bearings. Load Co is to be considered
as purely radial for radial bearings and purely axial and centred for axial bearings.
The values of Co are given in the bearing data table.


Static check and Equivalent Static Load Po
The purpose of static check is to ensure that exceptional external static loads acting on a
bearing of group of i bearings do not cause permanent race deformation.
To perform this check, external loads with radial component Fr and axial component Fa
must be transformed into an equivalent static load Po to be compared with static load
capacity Co of the bearing or group of bearings.
Equivalent static load Po is defined as the radial or axial load which would cause the
same damage as real load, if applied.
ISO Standard specifies that Po is obtained by using the following formula:
Po= Xo · Fr + Yo · Fa
where:
Fr
actual radial load   (daN)
Fa   actual axial load   (daN)
Xo
radial load factor. 
Yo
axial load factor.
The values of Xo and Yo are given in Table 1 for individual or tandem ball bearings and in
Table 2 for back-to-back (DD) or face-to-face (FF) matched bearings.
Once equivalent static load Po is known adequacy of static load Po is checked, by verifying that the following equation is respected:
i · Co / Po ≥So
Where:
i  
is the number of groups bearings which forces Fa and Fr act on;
i · Co Co is the static load capacity of the groups of i bearings;
So 
is a safety factor that must have the following value in the 
case of angular contact precision ball bearings:
So = 2 for regular operation
So = 3 for very frequent static stress conditions.
Advanced computerised calculation methods based on calculation of stress in the contact
area between balls and races versus external loads and shaft deformation are available at
SNFA Technical Department should more accurate assessment be required and for ceramic material ball bearings.

Matched Bearing Sets
A property of precision angular contact ball bearings is that they allow the creation of groups of two
or more units to obtain much higher load capacity and more rigid assembly with the same overall
diameter. 
The simplest form of a set is Duplex. This is an assembly of two ball bearings together in various
configurations (see below)
The following page illustrates Multiple sets which are mostly used in high load applications.
Duplex
Back to Back (DD)
- symmetrical arrangement;
- possibility to withstand radial
- axial loads in two directions;
- high moment rigidity.
Face to Face (FF)
- symmetrical arrangement;
- possibility to withstand radial
- axial loads in two directions;
- low moment rigidity.
Tandem (T)
- the bearings must be identical;
- possibility to withstand one
direction axial load, only;
- requires preloading by
springs


29
Multiple Sets
Groups with more than two bearings, can be employed whenever much higher load capacity and
more rigid assembly are requested, with the same overall diameter.
Example of multiple sets:
Groups formed with bearings of different kinds 
Duplex and Multiplex sets can be further varied by mixing the contact angles and/or different sizes or
series of bearings.
The only rule governing these sets concerns tandem groups, which must be formed with identical
bearings.
The main advantages which these sets offer are:
- optimisation of load capacity and rigidity
- possibility to reduce bearing preload and, consequently, to increase operating speed ( for example,
if preloading bearings of a set have smaller contact angle than loading bearings, the set preload
can be reduced without affecting the limiting axial load Pd )
- smaller overall dimensions of the preloading bearings.
Designation exemple: 
EX80 7CE3 T / EX 75 7CE1 DL
Group of 3 bearings, formed by 2 EX series bearings, tandem arrangement, 80 mm bore, 25°
contact angle and by 1 EX series bearing, 75 mm bore, 15° contact angle, back to back.


Details of SNFA Bearing Sets
The performance of bearing sets depends mostly on the accuracy of the
matching operation. 
To satisfy this condition SNFA bearing sets are made up as follows:
- reduced tolerance of gap between bearing faces in combination with
high precision measurement loading
- uniform contact angle
- minimum bore and outside diameter difference (about one third of
respective tolerances)
Observing the following recommendations is essential in using SNFA
bearing sets;
- never exchange bearings from different sets
- assemble the bearing sets as indicated by the V marked on the bearing outside diameter surface (the tip of this V points in the direction of
the predominant axial thrust  acting on the inner rings).
The axis of the V is at the point of maximum eccentricity (maximum
radial thickness ) of the outer ring of each bearing              


31
Universal Bearings
Bearings subject to selected axial preload ( light [L], medium [M] or heavy [F] ) and having flush side
faces under preload are classed as Universal [U].
SNFA universal bearings have the suffix UL, UM, UF according to the required preload and offer users
the possibility of forming groups of bearings in any required arrangement (DD, FF or T) by using their
own stock, without having to make any ring face adjustement.
As a consequence of their manufacturing features, the resultant preload of groups of U bearings is
obtained by multiplying the preload of the single U bearing by the following coefficients:
Sets                         Coefficient
DD     -     FF                       1,00
TD      -    TF                       1,35  
3TD    -    3TF                     1,60   
TDT    -    TFT                     2,00 
Above mentioned sets formed with “Universal“ bearings, when compared to the “SNFA matched
sets”, offer advantage for stocking requirements but their contact angle and bore / outer diameter
tolerance do not maintain SNFA standards.
A variant, consisting of Duplex Universal bearings, coded DUL, DUM and DUF according to preload, is
also available.
Its advantages can be summarised as follows:
the bearings of the same pair can be mounted in any configuration (DD, FF or T)
the contact angle difference between the two bearings is minimum (a significant advantage for a
tandem configuration)
the difference in the actual bore and outside diameter, between the two bearings, is minimal (one
third of overall tolerance)
Universal Duplex bearings from different sets may not be exchanged between each other.
The speed, preload and rigidity values indicated in the bearing table refer to SNFA matched bearings.
For asymmetrical groups (TD - TF), formed by single Universal bearings, these values must be calculated for each case, taking proper account of the preload correction coefficients mentioned above.

Preload
Preload can be defined as axial load applied permanently to bearings to ensure proper operation
under external load. Preload can be rigid, as in the case of opposed bearings with or without spacers, or elastic, using springs.
Rigid preload involves the formation of a gap between the faces of opposed bearings. This gap is
eliminated when bearings are locked axially.
Rigid preload may change during operation due to the effect of thermal expansion. With elastic preload, expansion is compensated for by the springs.  Bearing preload variation is minimal in this case.
Bearing preload is essential because of its influence on speed limits, rigidity and applicable work
loads.
The preloads commonly recommended to satisfy all requirements are Light [L], Medium [M] and
Heavy [F] and are given in the bearing data table. Bearings can be supplied with special preload.
The tables also indicate maximum speed and axial rigidity Ra, for each preload, for paired bearings
and for groups of three units.
Rigid preload reached during operation is often higher than that indicated in the catalogue.
The following factors are involved in this modification:
- bearing fit tolerances (housing and shaft)
- inner ring expansion due to centrifugal force and thermal effect
- ball dynamic effects
In order to prevent premature failure, a lower initial preload should be selected so it reaches the
proper value at full operation.
Contact Angle and Preload
The contact angle on all bearings
manufactured is measured by a purpose built machine working to an accuracy better than 30 minutes of arc.
The preloading of a pair or set of bearings is gauged on special presses.
These are also purpose built machines
which allow close control of the
applied load and accurate measurement of the displacement. Such is the
accuracy of this equipment that bearings in a set are matched to within 1
micron.


Limiting Axial Load
Limiting axial load, Pd, is the external axial load of a preloaded bearing pair or set that causes loss of
contact between the balls and race in preload bearings. This effect may lead to balls skidding against
the races and  surface damage.
This event may not occur as even a light radial load maintains ball/track contact. 
In applications (such as in some machine tools) , where the working axial load is predominantly in
one direction , limiting axial load Pd can be increased by using a  bearing set with a mixed contact
angle (C3/C1). The axially more rigid bearing (C3) withstands the work load and the less rigid (C1)
one is the reaction element.
The limiting axial load Pd is calculated as follows:
Note:
- Pr, set preload
- The above table can also be used for corresponding face-to-face configurations FF, TF, TFT
and 3TF, simply by giving Pd the value of Pd1.

Rigidity
Axial Rigidity
Rigidity Ra of an angular contact ball bearing is the external axial load causing 1 micron displacement
(daN / mm).
Ra of a bearing pair or set can also be defined as the ratio between the limiting axial load Pd and
bearing axial deflection δa2 (figure 1). Axial rigidity remains practically constant until external load is
greater than off load Pd.
Axial rigidity Ra varies as contact angle and bearing preload vary.
Preloaded bearing deflection curves are used to plot axial rigidity and the limiting axial load as follows
Radial rigidity
Angular contact ball bearing radial rigidity “ Rr “ too, varies with contact angle and preload; unlike
axial rigidity however, radial rigidity decreases as contact angle increases and changes markedly as a
function of the ratio between axial and external loads applied to the bearing.
The radial rigidity of a back-to-back or face-to-face bearing set can be empirically calculated as follows:

Fig. 1


Spacers
The addition of spacers between the bearings of a set may be necessary when the following is
required:
- increased angular rigidity by separating the bearing 
- heat generated by the bearings is to be disipated more effectively
- the space is required for oil jet nozzles.
Spacer manufacture requires good accuracy to ensure:
- parallel and planar faces within reduced tolerance limits (Cf. Bearing tolerances)
- equal width outer and inner spacers to keep bearing original preload unchanged (simultaneous
grinding is recommended)
- well-balanced rotating spacer.
The use of appropriate surface hardened (45HRc) or through hardening material is normally recommended. This treatment prevents the risk of spacer surface damage during assembly and wear during
subsequent operation.
Many materials are suitable for producing spacers, including the following:
-  ISO  100 Cr6  ( SAE 52100 )
:  through hardened 
-  UNI   38 Ni Cr Mo 4 (  SAE  9840 )
:  through hardened / tempered     
-  UNI   18 Ni Cr Mo 7 (SAE 4320)       :  case hardened             
Spacer configuration complexity depends on any other function it may have.
The rotating or static spacer of oil lubricated bearings may, for instance, be deflector shaped to facilitate oil flow through the bearings to ensure good oil drainage and disposal via the discharge channels. 
It must never restrict lubricant flow. 
Spacer configuration in grease lubricated bearings plays a secondary role.  The spacer shape must
however be such as to allow dispersal of the excess grease expelled by the bearings, especially during
the running in stage.
Preload arrangements of Back to Back ( DD ) or Face to Face ( FF ) can be modified by changing outer
or inner spacer width.
For instance, reducing the width of the spacer placed between the outside rings, causes:
- reduced preload in DD sets
- increased preload in FF sets
The opposite occurs by reducing the width of the spacer between the inner rings.


36
The following calculation is used for proper adjustment:
δa = 2 · 10-3 · Pr2/3 · Z-2/3 · Ø-1/3 · sinα-5/3
Where: δa = axial deflection 
(mm)
= preload
(daN)
Z

(mm)
α

(degrees)
In the case of MULTIPLEX arrangements, it is necessary to remember that deflection δa of the group
of bearings in TANDEM, under preload, is less than that of single bearings.
The deflection of the TANDEM group will therefore be:
δa (TANDEM) = W · δa (SINGLE)
Where:     No. bearings in TANDEM
W
0,63
0,48
0,40
The value of the preloading gap will thus be:
δat =    δa1 + δa2
Where: δat = total preload gap 
δa1 = deflection of load-carrying bearings
δa2 =
deflection of preload bearings
The value of reduction of the spacer for altering the preload will therefore be given by the difference
between the δat value relating to the initial preload and to that which it is desired to achieve.
Assembly Tolerances
Seat tolerances are very important both for assembly and bearing performance.
The values shown on the following tables are a guideline for shaft, housing and bearing surrounding
parts design.
Precision angular ball bearings are widely used in machine tools and the above tolerances mainly
involve this field of application, where the shaft generally rotates while the outside ring is stationary. 
In the opposite condition, the housing will require greater interference to prevent creep during operation. 
The same applies to shafts submitted to high rotating loads, such as winding machine shafts, for
instance.
The values given in the following Table are valid for steel shafts and housings.
Critical situations may occur in which the high temperature gradient between shaft and race requires
the application of special tolerances to prevent excess bearing preload and subsequent failure.

Lubrication
Lubrication reduces friction and heat generation inside the bearing and ensures the lubricant acts in
the rolling and sliding areas even in the presence of high stress. The lubricant also protects metal surfaces against corrosion.
Greasing
Greasing is the most common form of lubrication as it is simple and easy to use.
When operation conditions such as speed, temperature and cleanliness are within the limits indicated
by the grease lubricant vendor, bearings require no special maintenance, nor subsequent topping up.
This can therefore be called life-long lubrication.
Grease type selection is critical for safe bearing operation, depending on:
operating temperature
life
protection
noise level
A wide range of quality synthetic grease lubricants is available commercially. Products satisfying the
standards listed in the Table below are frequently used.
Speed, load and operating temperature are basic parameters for grease selection.
Bearings operating at high temperatures, such as in electrospindles, must be lubricated with long life
grease with a base oil of adequate viscosity and high wear resistance.
43
Greasing of Bearings
To reduce the risk of contamination during spindle assembly and to
ensure correct lubrication it is possible for customers to have bearings
greased by SNFA.
This operation is performed in a clean room using specialist equipment
immediately after the bearings have been washed. In this way the cleanness of the bearing, the correct amount of grease and its uniform distribution can be ensured.

Grease Life
The effectiveness of a grease reduces in time due to operating conditions such as temperature,
dynamic stress and contamination and to its chemical and physical characteristics.
These parameters are hard to estimate, so grease life hours ”Lg” are calculated prevalently on statistical data.
Figure 2 gives the necessary elements for assessing the life of quality synthetic greases in optimum
operating conditions. The upper part of the curve refers to operation in moderate temperature conditions, such as in belt driven spindles; the lower part refers to applications where the presence of
another heat source, such as an electric motor,  increases bearing temperature markedly, with negative effects on the lubricant.
Running in 
Grease lubricated bearings require an initial running-in period to ensure the correct lubricant distribution and to avoid bearing overheating at the starting operation.
The commonest form of running-in entails gradually reaching maximum speed and achieving stable
temperatures at each step.
Another procedure is an intensive sequence of run and stop cycles according to a pre-set programme. The latter reduces running-in time but requires constant observation and is only recommended for automated running-in equipment. This is not advisable for bearings which have to operate at a particularly high speed.

Grease Quantities
The amount of grease to be introduced into the bearing depends on
operating speed. The amount is calculated by multiplying factor K ( function of maximum rotation speed,
expressed in ndm - Figure 3 )by the “
reference quantity “ shown in the
diagram ( bore and bearing series
function; Fig.4 )
Factory Greased Bearings
SNFA bearings are very often supplied
with the type and amount of grease as
specified by the Customer.
This solution offers operating and economic advantages for the user, as the
bearing is greased during the manufacturing route with greater control over
cleanliness, quantity and distribution.

Bearing bore (mm)
In the case of small bearings where
grease quantities are very small it is
advised thet before greasing the bearings are immersed in a grease solution
(containing 3-5% grease) then removed and allowed to drain (and the solvent to evaporate) before applyng the
grease. This ensures that all the bearing
surface are covered with a thin layer of
the lubricant.


Oil Lubrication
Oil lubrication is mandatory when greasing  limits are exceeded.
Several different oil lubrication systems are used, the commonest for machine tools being:
- Oil Injection
- Oil Mist
- Air-Oil
Oil Injection
Oil injection is preferred for bearings having to operate at very high speed and high load, that is in
conditions that do not allow “oil mist “ lubrication because of the need to cool the bearings.
Oil is injected into the bearings through nozzles placed so as to lubricate the ball to race contacts
with minimum oil churning.  Drainage channels must be provided to prevent oil from stagnating and
churning and hence generating heat. 
Besides ensuring proper lubrication, the amount of oil crossing the bearings also removes the heat
generated by bearing operation and maintains overall temperature at acceptable levels.
The assembly should also include oil filtering, a heat exchanger to dissipate the heat removed from
the bearings and an adequate oil reserve. A suitable size reservoir facilitates heat dispersion and the
settling out of debris and avoids early lubricant ageing.
This type of lubrication obviously requires accurate and proper analysis. Precise rules for calculating oil
flow take account of the bearing type to be lubricated (series and pitch diameter) and assembly composition. Oil viscosity in an injection system is according to ISO standards VG10 or VG15

Oil Mist
Oil mist lubrication is widely used, especially in high speed applications, as it offers the
following advantages:
satisfactory efficiency even with complex bearing arrangements
low temperature, reduced power absorption
low cost assembly
simple construction (channels, spacers etc)
good protection against outside contamination (pressurised environment)
Oil mist lubrication systems must be designed to precise standards taking account of the
features and speed of the bearings to be lubricated. (Oil mist equipment manufacturers
are generally in a position to supply the required specific data).
Oil recommended for use in oil mist lubrication systems is ISO VG32
Air - Oil
An important peculiarity of this system is the use of a high viscosity synthetic oil (generally ISO VG68) which, even when applied in small amounts, ensures the presence of a
resistant film between rolling parts and bearing races.
This means simultaneous reduced ball rolling resistance and excellent bearing behaviour
even under high stress.
The system is moderately polluting for the following reasons:
low oil consumption
reduced misting effect
The conveyer element air and the oil reach the bearing via side nozzles (Figure. 5) or
through holes in the bearing outer ring (Cf.  paragraph H1 bearings ) without being
mixed during their passage.
Fig. 5


48
Air - oil lubrication has led to outstanding results in high frequency, high power electrospindles.
Series VEB and VEX high speed bearings in the air-oil lubricated version, with ceramic material balls
and outer ring with radial lubrication holes ( H1/NS execution ) can reach high speeds of over
2,500,000 ndm.
Oil quantity (Q) required can be calculated, roughly, with the following formula:
Q = 1.2 · dm  mm3/h
(for each bearing)
where dm is the bearing pitch diameter in millimetres
Air-oil flow to the bearings must be homogeneous and without losses along its path.
Individual air-oil supply to each bearing is therefore strongly recommended, even if a more
elaborate supply system may be required in certain instances.
Minimum oil
Any system capable of supplying a bearing with the amount of oil required for proper operation can
be considered as minimum.
This type of lubrication can be used for high speed bearings too, by direct injection of small amounts
of oil directly into the bearings, through the outside ring (H1 version bearings).
Oil type and dosage are monitored by a central control and a circuit ensuring continuous pressure
and flow.

Nozzle Position
Maximum efficiency is achieved for all oil lubrication systems when the lubrication flow reaches the bearing contact areas with minimum turbulence.
Nozzle positioning, as indicated in the table
below, is therefore strongly recommended.

Lubricant contamination effects on bearing life and behaviour
Cleanliness affects bearing life and efficiency. It is necessary to achieve an application where bearings
operate in free of external contamination.
It is important, therefore, to keep bearings clean during greasing and to provide good sealing during
operation.
Additional precautions must be taken for oil lubricated bearings to monitor lubrication contamination levels. In the case of oil re-circulation systems in particular, this depends on the rate of contamination, the filtration standard and the size of the filter.
Contamination by the ingress of coolants, cutting oils, etc alter lubricant properties thereby effecting
bearing life.  This should be eliminated at the design stage by providing adequate sealing.
Contaminating particle classifications are available, which specify limit sizes and amounts per unit
volume of 100 cm3.
With reference to ISO Standard
4406 (Figure. 6) for high precision
application as, for instance, high
performance electrospindles, contamination should be restricted to
level 10/7, for new spindles and
to level 13/10, after long use. In
any case the maximum particle size
should not exceed 5 µm.

Seals
The simplest of the many systems used to protect bearings during operation is the application of
commercially available seals, whose rubber or similar material lips is always in contact with the rotating shaft.
This system generates friction and cannot be used in high speed applications.  Efficient labyrinth
seals are important in these cases.  Their design varies according to available space, lubricant type
and operating environment.
The seals illustrated herein are commonly used in the machine tool industry and are quite suitable for
other applications with similar operating conditions.
Figure 7
The bearing is protected by the barrier created by the cover, with small clearance to the
shaft. This solution, suitable for moderately
dusty environments, is not recommended for
liquid contaminants. 
Figure 8
This is a slightly more complex but more efficient seal than the former. It features a supplementary internal barrier consisting of commercially available laminar rings that fit to the
static housing. Rubbing on the rotating parts
must be avoided.


53
Figures 9 and 10
These single and multiple type labyrinth
seals are more elaborate than the previous
ones but are more effective, especially in the
presence of  dust or coolant jets etc.
Figures 11 and 12
These single and multiple type labyrinth seals
are provided with drainage. The upper
cover, shown in Figure 12 (vertical axis), acts
as a centrifugal ring and ensures additional
protection against debris from the outside.
Figure 13
This seal is very effective due to the presence
of a pressure air barrier ( p = 0.2 bar ) in
the labyrinth space. In this system, particularly suitable for grease lubrication, the air must
be supplied filtered and dried, through a specific channel.
Oil lubricated bearings operate in a pressurised environment, so sealing efficiency
is less important than for grease lubricated
ones. All contamination should be avoided
for oil lubricated bearings especially when a
re-circulation circuit is provided:
9 - 10
11- 12

Handling
SNFA angular contact, precision bearings are produced in environmental conditions controlled strictly
throughout the whole manufacturing process, handling and packaging included.
Bearings users can take advantage of bearing performance only by using them properly and observing the following advice very carefully:
- store bearings in their original packaging, in a dry environment
- plan assembly sequence carefully
- operate in a suitable environment
- inspect components close to the bearings and check their cleanliness
- check with the drawing that the bearing designation is correct
- open the package when the bearings are required for installation
- if grease lubrication is specified, introduce the proper amount lubricant and distribute it
carefully. Compatibility issues with the bearing protection oil can arise when synthetic grease is
used. Whenever possible, wash it with well filtered products compatible with the environment and
the metal and dry it immediately after with dry and filtered compressed air.
- assemble the bearing in accordance with the instructions enclosed with the packaging
(excessive force should be avoided )
- if necessary, pre-heat the bearing bore or the outer housing


Fitting and clamping of Bearing Rings
Bearings are tightened axially on journals or into housings with either ring nuts or end
caps. These are manufactured to have:
- high geometrical precision
- good mechanical strength
- reliable locking 
Force Pa, obtained by tightening the ring nut or end cap, is extremely important and must:
prevent relative movement of adjacent components ensure correct bearing positioning
without deformation minimise material fatigue
Proper assessment of Pa is a little uncertain. The following formula can be used as a rule
of thumb for calculating tightening force Pa and resultant tightening torque C for ring
nuts and screws.  It should be verified during operation.
The value of Pa can be obtained from:
Pa = Fs + ( Ncp ˙ Fc ) + Pr
where:
Pa
Axial clamping force (daN)
Fs
Minimum axial clamping force (daN)
Fc
Axial fitting force (daN)
Bearing preload (daN)
Ncp
Number of preload bearings
The values for Fs and Fc can be found in the tables on pages 56, 57 and 58.
The standard values of Pr can, be found from the general catalogue or, in the case of a special preload, from
the bearing designation. The preload value is usually a negligible part of the clamping force value except in
the case of the BS series.
With values for Pa the tightening torque, C (daN · mm) can be calculated:
C = K ˙ Pa
for a locking nut
C = K ˙ Pa / Nb
for bolts in an end cap
where: 
K = factor based on the thread (see the table on page 58)
Nb = number of bolts in the end cap
Advice on the tightening procedure is given in “SNFA Bearing Assembly” booklet.

Complete designation marking (contact angle, precision, arrangement type, etc.) of medium - large
size bearing sets, maybe marked on one bearing only. The remaining bearings of the group have
markings indicating: type, trade mark and country of origin, only
Micron deviations from the nominal value of each bearing bore and outside diameter are
marked on that surface, at the point of maximum eccentricity ( maximum radial thickness ).
Maximum assembly concentricity is obtained by locating this point at 180° to maximum shaft or
housing eccentricity. 
Other markings that may appear on ring faces are manufacturing references; e.g.:manufacturing
date, serial No., etc.

Boxes
SNFA bearings are normally packaged in individual boxes, even when they belong to a bearing set.  In
this case boxes are grouped together. Marking is with labels applied to each of the boxes,
The label bears the following information:
- bearing set designation
- grease type (for SNFA greased bearings)
- actual contact angle ( for single Universal bearings only )
Boxes are cardboard, marked with the SNFA trade name and carrying the description: Precision
Bearings (in four languages). Moreover the box contains bearing mounting instructions in four languages.
Bearings with ceramic material balls are contained in boxes bearing a red colour label with the wording “ceramic” in gold characters.

Ball Screw Support Bearings
BS200 (ISO 02) and BS Special Size bearings are particularly suitable for precision applications with predominantly axial loads, due to their high axial rigidity and load
capacity.
BS bearings are manufactured to class ABEC 7 with
reduced axial runout error of 2.5 mm.
This high degree of precision translates into
- constant torque and uniform rotation even at high preload
- limited axial position error
- low operating temperature.
Similarly to the precision angular contact ball bearings
described so far, BS bearings are supplied either individually or in sets to better satisfy a wide range of different
applications.

BSDU, BSQU and BSQU / 1 Cartridge Units
Another effective solution for ballscrews is the use of BSDU and BSQU cartridges, containing two
and four  BS200 bearings respectively, with different arrangements, as shown in this catalogue, or to
specific requirements.
Cartridges can be easily assembled, and allow high precision and rigidity. They are well sealed and
lubricated for a long life.
BSQU/1 cartridges, supplied on request, differ from standard BSQUs in the position of the clamping
flange. In this case they contain four BS 200 bearings in any combination.

Series VEB-VEX very high speed bearings
SNFA Series VEB (ISO 19) and VEX (ISO 10) have been developed to offer outstanding performance
even in very demanding and advanced applications.
The different issues affecting high speed applications have been analysed when designing and producing these series. Particular attention has been paid to dynamic and heat effects and lubrication
problems without neglecting other features such as the load capacity and rigidity.
VEB and VEX bearings offer a wide range of application possibilities both with grease and oil lubrication. 
The speeds indicated in the Tables are valid for optimum operating conditions.
The values given for rigidly preloaded bearings are valid as long as operating conditions do not
involve marked heat-induced preload increase. In some applications, such as electrospindles for
instance, the electric motor generated heat thermally increases bearing preload and reduces the
speed obtainable.
In such cases a lower than indicated catalogue value of preload should be used so that at operating
temperature the correct preload is obtained.
H1/NS version VEB and VEX bearings (with ceramic balls and air-oil lubrication feed holes in
the outer ring) are the ideal solution for reaching maximum speed.
Minimum air-oil lubrication, controlled constant preload, accurate bearing mounting and good spindle balance are necessary for obtaining satisfactory results with VEB and VEX bearings.

NS Bearings with Ceramic Balls
SNFA has extensive experience in the manufacture and supply of these bearings commonly known as
“ Hybrid “.
They are usually used in particularly arduous applications to give  low temperature operation at high
speeds.
The successful use of this product in a range of applications has greatly increased the demand for it.
The ceramic ball material most commonly used is Silicon Nitride Si3N4.
Balls made of this material combine its excellent mechanical and physical properties with high technology machining processes. 
They feature good material homogeneity, high precision, reduced mass ( 40% of steel), high hardness
and good fatigue resistance.

Compared with steel ball bearings, NS bearings offer the following advantages:
- longer life, even at higher load
- higher resistance to seizure in critical lubrication situations
- lower power dissipation (Figure 14)
- lower operating temperature (Figure  5)
- higher speed both with oil and grease lubrication
- higher acceleration and deceleration limits
- greater static and dynamic rigidity (Figure 16)
- lower wear (Figure 17)

Field experience and laboratory tests have proven that
maximum speed achievable by hybrid bearings can be
15 to 30% more than conventional bearings.
The greatest benefits are obtained in applications with
grease lubrication, which have high operating temperature with steel ball bearings.
For bearings operating at high speed where there is
significant centrifugal force on the balls it has been
shown that bearing life can be markedly increased by
the use of ceramic balls.
All SNFA series can be equipped with ceramic material
balls. VEB and VEX series bearings designed for high
speed operation, use the features of this material to
the most effect.
Ceramic material ball bearings are coded with the
suffix /NS placed after the bore diameter.
E.g. VEX 50/NS 9 CE1
N.B. For bearings with balls greater than 14,28
mm diameter check with SNFA for availability.

H1 Bearings
This designation identifies an SNFA bearing with through the outer race holes for minimum oil lubrication.
This type of lubrication is typical of high speed applications; the H1 version is particularly suitable for
series VEB and VEX.
The feed holes of H1 bearings cross to a point (Fig. 18 ) very close to the ball and rolling track contact
area.
H1 design
These holes allow the lubricant to reach directly the ball raceway contacts and so ensure the presence
of an oil film even at high speed. All this means a series of advantages which translate into reduced
pollution due to low lubricant consumption and improved performance. The most evident advantage
is the possibility of reaching high speeds of over 2,500,00 ndm with a remarkable degree of
reliability.
The oil supply system of H1 bearings does not differ substantially from the conventional system for
minimum lubrication. The small amounts of circulating lubricant demand accurate jets that must be
simple, direct and of constant cross section.  They also require efficient seals to avoid pressure drops
and leakage. Each bearing must be provided with its own feed.
SNFA Technical Service can play an important information role during the development stage.
An example of an H1 designation bearing is:

HBB Cartridge Units
The HBB cartridge unit is an SNFA product developed for application on spindles and electrospindles
where the severe operating conditions ( high speed and great temperature difference between the
shaft and the bearing outer housing ) preclude the use of bearings rigidly preloaded, for the risk of
seizure.
The HBB cartridge unit has a special preloading device, prepared and adjusted by SNFA, which allows
bearings to operate without slackness assuring, at the same time, good stiffness, rigidity and stability.
In addition to these advantages, HBB cartridge units allow an easy handling and assembling in the
spindle.  
The compact shape and reduced dimension HBB cartridge unit can be adopted for a wide range of
new and old applications.  The latter ones without modification of the existing seatings. 
The bearings of HBB cartridges, matched back to back, can be of different types depending on shaft
diameter and operating conditions:
HBB../1 and HBB../2.
In all cases the bearings can be equipped with ceramic balls.
This special product is only supplied on request
HBB cartridge placed on the front end of an electrospindle
