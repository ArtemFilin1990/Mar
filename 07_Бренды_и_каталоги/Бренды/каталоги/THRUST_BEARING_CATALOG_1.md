POWER TRANSMISSION 
COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
Timken offers an expanding range of power transmission 
components including seals, couplings and engineered chain. 
Extreme temperatures and high contamination levels can 
disable your equipment and signiﬁcantly lower productivity. 
Timken develops seals using advanced material and process 
solutions that help protect machinery and minimize plant 
downtime. We offer a comprehensive line of large-bore oil and 
grease seals, and metallic and non-metallic bearing isolators.
Timken® Quick-Flex® couplings are highly durable, yet need 
minimal maintenance. They are easy to install and require no 
lubrication. The couplings are designed to connect motors 
and gearboxes with other moving equipment with capacity 
to transmit the same or more torque than a gear coupling in 
the same dimensions. The Quick-Flex coupling's innovative 
design utilizes an advanced elastomeric element to transmit 
the torque and therefore eliminates any interference between 
coupling hubs which can damage equipment.
Timken manufactures precision roller chains that are designed 
to meet demanding steel industry applications. We build 
chains to precise speciﬁcations for strength and maximum 
wear life. The offering includes a 
complete line of roller chains, 
attachment chains and 
engineered conveyor 
chains.
LUBRICATION
Timken® lubricants reduce friction, prevent wear and 
protect bearing surfaces from corrosion. We offer a wide 
selection of lubricants, including Timken® Mill Grease, which 
we formulated to perform in the difﬁcult roll neck bearing 
environment. Timken® single- and multi-point lubricators and 
lubrication delivery devices help maintenance  
professionals simplify their  
lubrication practices,

SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE OF GREASE-LUBRICATED 
BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS
To help you get the most value from our products, Timken provides guidelines for the shelf 
life of grease-lubricated ball and roller bearings, components and assemblies. Shelf life 
information is based on Timken and industry test data and experience.
SHELF LIFE
Shelf life should be distinguished from lubricated bearing/
component design life as follows:
Shelf life of the grease-lubricated bearing/component 
represents the period of time prior to use or installation.
The shelf life is a portion of the anticipated aggregate design 
life. It is impossible to accurately predict design life due to 
variations in lubricant bleed rates, oil migration, operating 
conditions, installation conditions, temperature, humidity and 
extended storage.
Shelf life values, available from Timken, represent a maximum 
limit and assume adherence to the storage and handling 
guidelines suggested in this catalog or by a Timken associate. 
Deviation from the Timken storage and handling guidelines may 
reduce shelf life. Any speciﬁcation or operating practice that 
deﬁnes a shorter shelf life should be used.
Timken cannot anticipate the performance of the grease 
lubricant after the bearing or component is installed or placed 
in service.
TIMKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHELF LIFE 
OF ANY BEARING/COMPONENT LUBRICATED BY 
ANOTHER PARTY.
European REACH Compliance
Timken lubricants, greases and similar products sold in 
standalone containers or delivery systems are subject to the 
European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of CHemicals) directive. For import into the 
European Union, Timken can sell and provide only those 
lubricants and greases that are registered with ECHA 
(European CHemical Agency). For further information, please 
contact your Timken engineer.
STORAGE
Timken suggests the following storage guidelines for our 
ﬁnished products (bearings, components and assemblies, 
referred to as “products”):
 • Unless directed otherwise by Timken, products should be 
kept in their original packaging until they are ready to be 
placed into service.
 • Do not remove or alter any labels or stencil markings on the 
packaging.
 • Products should be stored in such a way that the packaging 
is not pierced, crushed or otherwise damaged.
 • After a product is removed from its packaging, it should be 
placed into service as soon as possible.

A
 • When removing a product that is 
not individually packaged from a 
bulk pack container, the container 
should be resealed immediately after 
the product is removed.
 • Do not use product that has exceeded 
its shelf life as deﬁned in the Timken shelf 
life guidelines statement.
 • The storage area temperature should be 
maintained between 0º C (32º F) and 40º C (104º F); 
temperature ﬂuctuations should be minimized.
 • The relative humidity should be maintained below 60 per-
cent and the surfaces should be dry.
 • The storage area should be kept free from airborne con-
taminants such as, but not limited to, dust, dirt, harmful 
vapors, etc.
 • The storage area should be isolated from undue vibration.
 • Extreme conditions of any kind should be avoided.
Due to the fact that Timken is not familiar with your particular 
storage conditions, we strongly suggest following these 
guidelines. However, you may be required by circumstances 
or applicable government requirements to adhere to stricter 
storage requirements.
Most bearing components typically ship protected with a 
corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant. These 
components may be used in oil-lubricated applications without 
removal of the corrosion-preventive compound. When using 
some specialized grease lubrications, we advise you to remove 
the corrosion-preventive compound before packing the 
bearing components with suitable grease.

THRUST BEARING TYPES
ENGINEERING
14   TIMKEN
® THRUST BEARING CATALOG   
THRUST BEARING TYPES
Standard types of thrust bearings manufactured by Timken 
include: 
TVL – Single-row angular contact thrust ball bearing.
DTVL – Double-row (two direction) angular contact thrust  
ball bearing.
TP –  Thrust cylindrical roller bearing.
TPS –  Self-aligning thrust cylindrical roller bearing.
TSR – Thrust spherical roller bearing.
TTHD – Heavy-duty thrust tapered roller bearing with two 
tapered raceways. Variants include:
• TTHDSX – where one tapered raceway has a convex 
outer surface for static alignment (SX).
• TTHDSV – where one tapered raceway has a concave 
outer surface for static alignment (SV).
TTHDFL – Heavy-duty thrust tapered roller bearing having one 
ﬂat and one tapered raceway. Variants include:
• TTHDFLSA – where the ﬂat raceway is made of two 
self-aligning washers (SA).
• TTHDFLSX – where the tapered raceway has a convex 
outer surface for static alignment (SX).
• TTHDFLSV – where the tapered raceway has a concave 
outer surface for static alignment (SV).
TTSP – Steering pivot thrust tapered roller bearing, off-apex 
design.
TTC – Steering pivot thrust tapered roller bearing, full 
complement (cageless).
TTD – Double-acting thrust tapered roller bearing.
TXR – Crossed roller bearing.
Each type is designed to take thrust loads. Types TVL, DTVL, 
TSR and TXR can accommodate radial loads as well. All types 
reﬂect advanced design concepts, with large rolling elements for 
maximum capacity. For some thrust roller bearings, controlled-
contour rollers are used to ensure uniform, full-length contact 
between rollers and raceways resulting in maximum capacity. 
Thrust bearings should operate under continuous load for 
satisfactory performance.
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL 
BEARINGS 
Thrust ball bearings are used for lighter loads and higher speeds 
than thrust roller bearings. 
TVL
Type TVL is a separable angular contact ball bearing primarily 
designed for unidirectional thrust loads. The angular contact 
design, however, will accommodate combined radial and thrust 
loads since the loads are transmitted angularly through the balls.
The bearing has two hardened and ground steel rings with 
ball grooves and a one-piece brass cage that spaces the ball 
complement. The larger ring is called the outer ring, and the 
smaller the inner ring. Timken standard tolerances for type TVL 
bearings are equivalent to ABEC 1 where applicable, but higher 
grades of precision are available.
Usually the inner ring is the rotating member and is shaft mounted. 
The outer ring is normally stationary and should be mounted with 
O.D. clearance to allow the bearing to assume its proper operating 
position. If combined loads exist, the outer ring must be radially 
located in the housing.
Type TVL bearings should always be operated under thrust load. 
Normally, this presents no problem as the bearing is usually 
applied on vertical shafts in oil ﬁeld rotary tables and machine 
tool indexing tables. If constant thrust load is not present, it should 
be imposed by springs or other built-in devices.
Low friction, cool running and quiet operation are advantages of 
TVL bearings, which may be operated at relatively high speeds. 
TVL bearings also are less sensitive to misalignment than other 
types of rigid thrust bearings.
Fig. 1. Type TVL.

THRUST BEARING TYPES
ENGINEERING
 TIMKEN
® THRUST BEARING CATALOG  15
DTVL
Type DTVL is similar in design to TVL except that the DTVL has 
an additional ring and ball complement permitting it to carry 
moderate thrust in one direction and light thrust in the other 
direction.
Fig. 2. Type DTVL.
THRUST CYLINDRICAL ROLLER 
BEARINGS 
Thrust cylindrical roller bearings are designed to operate under 
heavy thrust loads at moderate speeds. Standard versions of 
these bearings can be operated at peripheral bearing O.D. speeds 
up to approximately 15 m/s (3000 fpm). Higher operating speeds 
can be attained with the incorporation of special design features. 
Consult your Timken engineer for these applications.
For applications where thrust loads are high, lubricants with 
extreme-pressure (EP) additives should be used. The preferred 
inlet location for the lubricant is at the bearing bore as centrifugal 
force will cause the lubricant to distribute radially toward the 
rollers. 
Two types of thrust cylindrical roller bearings, TP and TPS, are 
available.
TP
Type TP thrust cylindrical roller bearings have two hardened and 
ground raceways and a window-type steel cage which retains 
one or more proﬁled rollers per pocket. When multiple rollers are 
used in each pocket, they are different lengths and are placed in 
staggered position relative to rollers in adjacent pockets to create 
overlapping roller paths. This minimizes wear of the raceways 
and therefore increases bearing life. 
Because of the simplicity of their design, type TP bearings are 
economical. Shaft and housing seats must be square to the axis 
of rotation to prevent initial misalignment problems.

Fig. 3. Type TP.
TPS
Type TPS bearings have a lower race comprised of two rings, with 
the contacting faces spherically ground to provide an aligning 
feature. As a result, the TPS bearing is self-adjusting to static 
misalignment. Its use is not, however, suggested for operating 
conditions where alignment is continuously changing (dynamic 
misalignment).

Fig. 4. Type TPS. 
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER 
BEARINGS 
Thrust spherical roller bearings are designed with spherically 
contoured rollers arranged in a steep angular conﬁguration to 
achieve a high-thrust capacity with low friction and continuous 
roller alignment. In addition to thrust loads, they can accommodate 
moderate radial loads. Maximum allowable bearing O.D. speeds 
are typically in the 25-30 m/s (5000-6000 fpm) range, depending on 
size and operating temperature. They represent a combination of 
radial and thrust bearings, designed to operate even if shaft and 
housing are, or become, misaligned under load. Thrust spherical 
roller bearings are preferred when conditions include heavy 
loads, difﬁculties in establishing or maintaining housing alignment 
or when shaft deﬂection can be expected.
Shaft deﬂections and housing distortions caused by shock or 
heavy loads (which lead to misalignment) are compensated for 
by the internal self-alignment of the bearing elements during 
operation. Elevated edge stress on rollers, a condition that limits 
service life on other types of bearings, does not develop in thrust 
spherical roller bearings.

The thrust spherical roller bearing achieves high-thrust capacity 
and allows axial misalignment between the inner ring and the 
outer ring of up to ±2.5˚. Timken thrust spherical roller bearings 
are now offered exclusively with maximum capacity E-type cage 
construction (EM-ﬁnger type machined bronze cage, EJ- window 
type steel cage). Those having a bore size less than 320 mm 
(12.598 in.) are typically offered as TSR-EJ designs, while those 
with larger bores are typically designated as TSR-EM.
The inherent compensation for misalignment, provided by the 
spherical roller bearings, offers the designer the opportunity to 
use weldments for housing frames instead of complex castings. 
This eliminates high-cost machining operations. When castings 
are preferred, bore alignment is less critical if spherical roller 
bearings are speciﬁed. Should extreme conditions of loading 
and/or speed under misalignment be anticipated, contact your 
Timken engineer before ordering.
TSR-EJ
TSR-EJ bearings use window-type steel cages that wrap around 
an extension on the inner race to provide a retention means for 
the cage and rollers. This construction unitizes the cage and 
roller assembly with the inner ring, and hence simpliﬁes bearing 
mounting and handling.
Fig. 5. Type TSR-EJ.
TSR-EM
TSR-EM bearings use ﬁnger-type brass cages. The brass cage 
design provides improved lubrication characteristics over a 
steel cage and in some cases allows for an additional roller, 
resulting in higher dynamic load rating. TSR-EM bearings have a 
roller retention ring, also known as the cage band, mounted and 
secured to the inner ring to retain the rollers.

TTHD, TTHDSX AND TTHDSV 
Type TTHD heavy-duty thrust tapered roller bearings have an 
identical pair of hardened and ground steel rings with tapered 
raceways, controlled-contour tapered rollers and typically a 
cage to equally space the rollers. The raceways of both rings and 
the tapered rollers have a common apex at the bearing center, 
providing true rolling motion. As a result, maximum speed ratings 
for TTHD bearings are higher than those of most other thrust 
bearing types. Type TTHD bearings also can be supplied with a full 
complement of rollers for low-speed, heavily loaded applications. 
Full-complement designs offer the highest capacity at somewhat 
reduced speed capability. Applications for full-complement 
bearings should be reviewed by your Timken engineer for help 
in selection of the proper bearing. 
TTHD bearings are well-suited for applications where high thrust 
and/or heavy shock loads are applied and radial positioning is 
critical. Typical applications for TTHD bearings include crane 
hooks, oil well swivels, pulp reﬁners, extruders and piercing mill 
thrust blocks.

Type TTHDFLSA bearings are similar to TTHDFL, except that 
the bottom race assembly is comprised of two rings, with the 
contacting faces spherically ground. As a result, the TTHDFLSA 
bearing is self-adjusting to static misalignment. It should not be 
used for operating conditions where alignment is continuously 
changing (dynamic misalignment).

Types TTHDFLSX and TTHDFLSV are full-complement designs 
having one raceway with either a convex or concave outer 
surface for the purpose of static alignment. They are commonly 
known as screw down bearings in the metals industry. They do 
not have a conventional bore, but are provided with center inserts 
for lifting and assembly. The full-complement design offers the 
highest capacity, but a reduced speed capability compared to 
other thrust bearings having a ﬂat raceway.

Type TTHDSX and TTHDSV thrust tapered roller bearings have

Outer raceways for TTHDSX and TTHDSV bearings have convex 
and concave outer surfaces, respectively, for the purpose of 
set-up alignment. They do not have a conventional bore, but are 
provided with center inserts for attachment purposes as well 
as lifting.

TTHDFL, TTHDFLSA, TTHDFLSX AND TTHDFLSV
Types TTHDFL, TTHDFLSA, TTHDFLSX and TTHDFLSV heavy-duty 
thrust bearings have one tapered raceway, one ﬂat raceway and 
controlled-contour rollers to optimize stress distribution over 
the contact surface. These designs combine features offering 
the highest possible capacity of any thrust bearing of their size 
and providing superior static thrust capacity. The designs were 
originally developed for metal scewdown rolling mill (breaker 
block) applications. They also are used in heavily loaded 
extruders, cone crushers and other applications where a wide 
range of operating conditions are found.
Type TTHDFL bearings typically use brass cages for smaller sizes 
and pin-type cages for larger sizes. The pin-type cage includes 
hardened pins which are inserted through the rollers, allowing 
closer roller spacing to maximize capacity. Smaller sizes typically 
use pocket-type machined brass cages. Both the brass and pin-
type cages are designed to permit a full ﬂow of lubricant to all 
critical surfaces, providing cooler operation.

TXR – CROSSED ROLLER BEARINGS
A crossed roller bearing is two sets of bearing rings and rollers 
brought together at right angles with alternate rollers facing 
opposite directions. TXR bearings have a section height not 
much greater than that of a TS bearing. The steep angle, tapered 
geometry of the bearing results in a total effective bearing spread 
many times greater than the width of the bearing itself. This type 
of bearing offers a high resistance to overturning moments.

The normal design of the bearing is type TXRDO, which has 
a double outer ring and two inner rings, with rollers spaced 
by polymer cages. Another design, Type TXRDI, has a double 
inner-ring and two outer rings. Crossed roller bearings are 
manufactured in precision classes. The crossed roller bearing is 
ideal for machine tool applications such as vertical boring mills, 
grinding machines, and other similar applications.

DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT  
THRUST LOAD (Pa)
To calculate the fatigue life of a thrust bearing, it is necessary 
to calculate a dynamic equivalent thrust load, designated as Pa. 
The dynamic equivalent thrust load is deﬁned as the single thrust 
load that, if applied to the bearing, will result in the same life as 
the combined radial and thrust loading under which the bearing 
operates. For thrust ball, thrust spherical and thrust tapered 
roller bearings, the existence of radial loads introduces complex 
load calculations that must be carefully considered. If the radial 
load (Fr) is zero, the dynamic equivalent thrust load will be equal 
to the applied thrust load (Fa). 
THRUST BALL, CYLINDRICAL AND TAPERED 
ROLLER BEARINGS
Thrust cylindrical roller bearings, as well as most thrust ball and 
thrust tapered roller bearings, are designed to carry thrust load 
only. The dynamic equivalent thrust load is equal to the applied 
thrust load (Fa) for these pure thrust applications. For thrust ball 
and thrust tapered roller bearing applications where radial load 
is applied, load calculations become much more complex. Please 
consult your Timken engineer for a review of bearing selection 
and application. 
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS
For angular contact thrust ball bearings, the dynamic equivalent 
thrust load is determined by: 
Pa = X Fr + Y Fa
For standard TVL and DTVL bearings having a 50° contact angle, 
X = 0.76 and Y = 1.00. Minimim Fa/Fr ratio to maintain proper 
operation for these applications is 1.56.
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Thrust spherical roller bearing dynamic loads are determined by:
Pa = 1.2Fr + Fa
Radial load (Fr) of a thrust spherical roller bearing is proportional 
to the applied axial load (Fa) such that Fr≤ 0.55 Fa. The steep 
roller angle induces a thrust load (Fai = 1.2Fr) when a radial load 
is applied. This thrust load must be resisted by another thrust 
bearing on the shaft or by an axial load greater than Fai.
STATIC AXIAL EQUIVALENT LOADS
To compare the load on a non-rotating bearing with the basic 
static capacity, it is necessary to determine the static equivalent 
load. In the case of thrust bearings, the static equivalent thrust 
load is used. The static axial equivalent load is deﬁned as the 
pure thrust load that produces the same contact pressure in the 
center of the most heavily stressed rolling element as the actual 
combined load. The static axial equivalent load is dependent on 
the bearing type selected. For bearings such as thrust cylindrical 
roller bearings and most thrust tapered roller bearings that are 
designed to accommodate thrust loading only, the static axial 
equivalent load is equal to the applied load. For thrust tapered 
roller bearings where a radial load or moment is applied, please 
consult your Timken engineer.
THRUST BALL, CYLINDRICAL AND TAPERED 
ROLLER BEARINGS
Thrust cylindrical roller bearings, as well as most thrust ball and 
thrust tapered roller bearings, are designed to carry thrust load 
only. The static axial equivalent load is equal to the applied thrust 
load for these pure thrust applications. For thrust ball and thrust 
tapered roller bearing applications where radial load is applied, 
load calculations become much more complex. Please consult 
your Timken engineer for these applications.
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Angular contact thrust ball bearings use the same equation for 
equivalent static and dynamic loading. 
Poa = Xo Fr + Yo Fa
For standard TVL and DVL bearings having a 50° contact angle, 
X = 0.76 and Y = 1.00. 
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
The following equation is used for thrust spherical roller bearings:
Poa = Fa + 2.7 Fr
Thrust spherical roller bearings require a minimum thrust load 
for proper operation. Poa should not be greater than 0.5 Coa. If 
conditions exceed this, consult your Timken engineer.

MINIMUM BEARING LOAD
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Centrifugal force in thrust spherical roller bearings tends to propel 
the rollers outward. The bearing geometry converts this force to 
induced thrust component, which must be overcome by an axial 
load. This induced thrust (Fac) is given by:
Fac = Kc n2 x 10-5 (lbf per RPM)
Kc = centrifugal force constant found in product tables pages 87-91
The minimum required working thrust load on a thrust spherical 
roller bearing (Fa min) is then computed by:
Fa min = 1.2 Fr + Fac >= C0a/1000 (lbf)
In addition to meeting the above calculated value, the minimum 
required working thrust load (Fa min) should be equal to or greater 
than 0.1 percent of the static thrust load rating (C0a).

BEARING RATINGS
ENGINEERING
BEARING RATINGS
There are two fundamental load ratings for bearings, a dynamic 
load rating and a static load rating. The dynamic load rating is 
used to estimate the life of a rotating bearing. Static load ratings 
are used to determine the maximum permissible load that can 
be applied to a non-rotating bearing.
DYNAMIC LOAD RATING
Published dynamic load ratings for Timken bearings are typically 
based on a rated life of one million revolutions. This rating, 
designated as C, is deﬁned as the radial load under which a 
population of bearings will achieve an L10 life of one million 
revolutions. For Timken tapered roller bearings, the dynamic 
load rating is more commonly based on a rated life of 90 million 
revolutions, with the designation of C90. This rating is the radial 
load under which a population of bearings will achieve an L10 life 
of 90 million revolutions. For tapered roller bearings, the dynamic 
thrust rating also is published and is designated as Ca90. The Ca90 
rating is the thrust load under which a population of bearings will 
achieve an L10 life of 90 million revolutions. The dynamic load 
rating of a bearing is a function of material cleanliness as well as 
the internal bearing geometry, which includes raceway angles, 
contact length between rolling elements and raceways, and the 
number and size of rolling elements. 
STATIC LOAD RATING
The basic static radial load rating and thrust load rating for 
Timken bearings are based on a maximum contact stress within 
a non-rotating bearing of 4000 MPa (580 ksi) for roller bearings 
and 4200 MPa (609 ksi) for ball bearings, at the center of contact 
on the most heavily loaded rolling element.
The 4000 MPa (580 ksi) or 4200 MPa (609 ksi) stress levels may 
cause visible light Brinell marks on the bearing raceways. This 
degree of marking will not have a measurable effect on fatigue 
life when the bearing is subsequently rotating under a lower 
application load. If sound, vibration or torque is critical, or if a 
pronounced shock load is present, a lower load limit should be 
applied. For more information on selecting a bearing for static 
load conditions, consult your Timken engineer.
BEARING LIFE
Many different performance criteria exist that dictate how a 
bearing should be selected. These include bearing fatigue life, 
rotational precision, power requirements, temperature limits, 
speed capabilities, sound, etc. This section deals primarily with 
bearing life as related to material-associated fatigue. Bearing 
life is deﬁned as the length of time, or number of revolutions, 
until a fatigue spall of 6 mm2 (0.01 in.2) develops. Since fatigue 
is a statistical phenomenon, the life of an individual bearing 
is impossible to predetermine precisely. Bearings that may 
appear to be identical can exhibit considerable life scatter when 
tested under identical conditions. Thus it is necessary to base 
life predictions on a statistical evaluation of a large number 
of bearings operating under similar conditions. The Weibull 
distribution function is the accepted standard for predicting the 
life of a population of bearings at any given reliability level.
RATING LIFE
Rating life, (L10), is the life that 90 percent of a group of apparently 
identical bearings will complete or exceed before a fatigue spall 
develops. The L10 life also is associated with 90 percent reliability 
for a single bearing under a certain load.
BEARING LIFE EQUATIONS
Traditionally, the L10 life has been calculated as follows for 
bearings under radial or combined loading, where the dynamic 
equivalent radial load, Pr, has been determined and the dynamic 
load rating is based on one million cycles:

With increased emphasis on the relationship between the 
reference conditions and the actual environment in which the 
bearing operates in the machine, the traditional life equations 
have been expanded to include certain additional variables or 
factors that affect bearing performance. The approach whereby 
these factors are considered in the bearing analysis and selection

RELIABILITY LIFE FACTOR (a1)
Reliability, in the context of bearing life for a group of apparently 
identical bearings operating under the same conditions, is the 
percentage of the group that is expected to attain or exceed 
a speciﬁed life. The reliability of an individual bearing is the 
probability that the bearing will attain or exceed a speciﬁed life. 
The reliability life adjustment factor is:

a1 =   4.26   ln 100    2/3 
+ 0.05
                                                   R

ln =  natural logarithm (base e)
To adjust the calculated L10 life for reliability, multiply by the 
a1 factor. If 90 (90 percent reliability) is substituted for R in the 
above equation, a1 = 1. For R = 99 (99 percent reliability), a1 = 
0.25. The table below lists the reliability factors for commonly 
used reliability values.

shown the minimum life, below which the probability of bearing damage is negligible, 
to be larger than predicted using the above adjustment factor. For a more accurate 
prediction of bearing lives at high levels of reliability, consult your Timken engineer.

MATERIAL LIFE FACTOR (a2)
The life adjustment factor for bearing material, a2, for standard 
Timken bearings manufactured from bearing quality steel is 1.0. 
Bearings also are manufactured from premium steels, containing 
fewer and smaller inclusion impurities than standard steels 
and providing the beneﬁt of extending bearing fatigue life (e.g., 
DuraSpexx® bearing). Application of the material life factor 
requires that fatigue life is limited by nonmetallic inclusions, 
that contact stresses are approximately less than 2400 MPa 
(350 ksi), and adequate lubrication is provided. It is important to 
note that improvements in material cannot offset poor lubrication 
in an operating bearing system. Consult your Timken engineer for 
applicability of the material factor.
DEBRIS LIFE FACTOR (a3d)
Debris within a lubrication system reduces the life of a roller 
bearing by creating indentations on the contacting surfaces, 
leading to stress risers. The Timken life rating equations were 
developed based on test data obtained with 40 μm oil ﬁltration, 
and measured ISO cleanliness levels of approximately 15/12, 
which is typical of cleanliness levels found in normal industrial 
machinery. When more or less debris is present within the system, 
the fatigue life predictions can be adjusted according to the 
measured or expected ISO lubricant cleanliness level to more 
accurately reﬂect the expected bearing performance.
Fig. 25. Surface map of a bearing raceway with debris denting.
A more accurate option for predicting bearing life in a debris 
environment is to perform a Debris Signature Analysis™. 
The Debris Signature Analysis is a process for determining 
the effects of the actual debris present in your system on the 
bearing performance. The typical way in which this occurs is 
through measurements of dented/bruised surfaces on actual 
bearings run in a given application. This type of analysis can be 
beneﬁcial because different types of debris cause differing levels 
of performance degradation. Soft, ductile particles can cause 
differing levels of performance degradation than hard, brittle 
particles. Hard, ductile particles are typically most detrimental to 
bearing life. Brittle particles can break down, thus not affecting 
performance to as large of a degree as hard, ductile particles. For 
more information on Debris Signature Analysis or the availability 
of debris-resistant bearings for your application, consult your

LUBRICATION LIFE FACTOR (a3l)
The inﬂuence of lubrication ﬁlm on bearing performance is related 
to the reduction or prevention of asperity (metal-metal) contact 
between the bearing surfaces. Extensive testing has been done at 
at our technology centers to quantify the effects of the lubrication-
related parameters on bearing life. It has been found that the roller 
and raceway surface ﬁnish, relative to lubricant ﬁlm thickness, 
has the most notable effect on improving bearing performance. 
Factors such as bearing geometry, material, loads and load zones 
also play an important role in bearing performance.
The following equation provides a method to calculate the 
lubrication factor for a more accurate prediction of the inﬂuence 
of lubrication on bearing life (L10a): 
a3l = Cg Cl Cs Cv Cgr 
The a3l maximum is 2.88 for all bearings. The a3l minimum is 0.200 
for case-carburized bearings and 0.126 for through-hardened 
bearings. A lubricant contamination factor is not included in the 
lubrication factor because Timken endurance tests are typically 
run with a 40 μm ﬁlter to provide a realistic level of lubricant 
cleanness for most applications.
Geometry factor (Cg)
Cg is given for most part numbers that are available in the bearing 
catalogs on www.timken.com. The geometry factor also includes 
the material effects and load zone considerations for non-tapered 
roller bearings, as these also are inherent to the bearing design. 
However, it should be noted that the primary effect of the load 
zone is on roller load distributions and contact stresses within 
the bearing, which are not quantiﬁed within the lubrication factor. 
Refer to the previous section Load Zone Life Factor (a3k) for more 
information.
The geometry factor (Cg) is not applicable to our DuraSpexx™ 
product. For more information on our DuraSpexx product, consult

Viscosity factor (Cv)
The lubricant kinematic viscosity (centistokes [cSt]) is taken at 
the operating temperature of the bearing. The operating viscosity 
can be estimated by ﬁg. 28. The viscosity factor (Cv) can then be 
determined from ﬁgs. 28 and 29 shown here.

LOW-LOAD LIFE FACTOR (a3p)
Bearing life tests show greatly extended 
bearing fatigue life performance is achievable 
when the bearing contact stresses are low 
and the lubricant film is sufficient to fully 
separate the micro-scale textures of the 
contacting surfaces. Mating the test data 
with sophisticated computer programs for 
predicting bearing performance, Timken 
engineers developed a low-load factor to 
predict the life increase expected when 
operating under low-bearing loads. Fig. 30 
shows the low-load factor (a3p) as a function 
of the lubricant life factor (a3l) and the ratio 
of bearing dynamic rating to the bearing 
equivalent load.

GREASE LUBRICATION FACTOR (Cgr)
Over time, grease degradation causes a reduction in lubricant 
ﬁlm thickness. Consequently, a reduction factor (Cgr) should be 
used to adjust for this effect.
Cgr = 0.79 
MISALIGNMENT LIFE FACTOR (a3m)
Accurate alignment of the shaft relative to the housing is critical for 
bearing performance. As misalignment increases under moderate 
to heavy loads, high contact stresses can be generated at the 
edges of contact between the raceway and rolling element. Special 
proﬁling of the raceway or rolling element can, in most cases, offset 
the effects of misalignment as shown in ﬁg. 31. This ﬁgure shows 
the roller-to-inner ring contact stress of a tapered roller bearing 
under a misaligned condition with and without special proﬁling. 
The proﬁling signiﬁcantly reduces the edge stress, resulting in 
improved bearing performance. The misalignment factor takes 
into account the effects of proﬁling on bearing life.
The misalignment factor for thrust spherical roller bearings is 1.0 
due to their self-aligning capabilities. The allowable misalignment 
of a thrust spherical roller bearing is ± 2.5 degrees. Life will be 
reduced if these limits are exceeded. For misalignment factors for 
other thrust bearing types, contact your Timken engineer.
Performance of all Timken bearings under various levels of 
misalignment and radial and axial load can be predicted using 
sophisticated computer programs. Using these programs, 
Timken engineers can design special bearing-contact proﬁles 
to accommodate the conditions of radial load, axial load and/or 
bearing misalignment in your application. Consult your Timken 
engineer for more information.

SYSTEM LIFE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAD AND LIFE
ENGINEERING

SYSTEM LIFE
System reliability is the probability that all of the given bearings 
in a system will attain or exceed some required life. System 
reliability is the product of the individual bearing reliabilities in 
the system:

R(system) = RA RB RC…. Rn
In the application, the L10 system life for a number of bearings 
each having different L10 life is:

L10(system) = [(1/L10A)3/2 + (1/L10B)3/2 + ….(1/L10n)3/2]-2/3
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAD AND  
LIFE EQUATIONS
In many applications, bearings are subjected to various conditions 
of loading, and bearing selection is often made on the basis of 
maximum load and speed. However, under these conditions, a 
more meaningful analysis may be made by examining the loading 
cycle to determine the weighted average load.
Bearing selection based on weighted average loading will take 
into account variations in speed, load and proportion of time 
during which the variable loads and speeds occur. However, it is 
still necessary to consider extreme loading conditions to evaluate 
bearing contact stresses and alignment.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAD
Variable speed, load and proportion time:

Fwt  =  [(n1 t1 F1 10/3 + ….nn tn Fn 10/3) / na]0.3
Uniformly increasing load, constant speed:

Fwt  =  [(3/13) (Fmax13/3 - Fmin 13/3) / (Fmax - Fmin)]0.3
Use of the weighted average load in the bearing life equation 
does not take into account the effects of different speeds on the 
lubrication factor a3l. For load cycles with varying speeds, it is 
recommended that life calculations be made for each condition 
and that the life for each condition be plugged into the weighted 
average life equation.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE

Lnwt = 1/{[t1 / (Ln)1]+ [t2 / (Ln)2]+… [tn / (Ln)n]}

BEARING TOLERANCES, METRIC AND INCH SYSTEMS
Ball and roller bearings are manufactured to a number of speciﬁcations, with each having classes 
that deﬁne dimensional tolerances such as inside diameter, outside diameter, width and runout. 
In addition, bearings are produced in both inch and metric systems with the boundary dimension 
tolerances being different for these two systems. The major difference between the two systems 
is that inch bearings have historically been manufactured to positive bore and O.D. tolerances, 
whereas metric bearings have been manufactured to corresponding standard negative tolerances.
The following table summarizes the different speciﬁcations and classes for ball, tapered roller, 
cylindrical roller and spherical roller bearings. For the purpose of this catalog, ISO speciﬁcations 
are shown for ball, cylindrical roller and spherical roller bearings. Timken speciﬁcations are shown 
for tapered roller bearings. Timken® thrust tapered roller bearings comply with current ABMA 
inch system standard 23.2. Standard Timken® ball, spherical roller and cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings maintain normal metric system tolerances according to the current ISO standard 199. 
The term deviation is deﬁned as the difference between a single ring dimension and the nominal 
dimension. For metric tolerances, the nominal dimension is at a +0 mm (0 in.) tolerance. The 
deviation is the tolerance range for the listed parameter. Variation is deﬁned as the difference 
between the largest and smallest measurements of a given parameter for an individual ring.
Boundary dimension tolerances for Timken thrust bearings are listed in the following tables (pages 
30-35). These tolerances are provided for use in selecting bearings for general applications in 
conjunction with the bearing mounting and ﬁtting practices offered in later sections.

MOUNTING DESIGN, FITTING PRACTICE AND SETTING 
MOUNTING DESIGN
All bearing types are typically mounted onto a shaft and into a 
housing where the shaft and housing have surfaces supporting 
the rings. These surfaces establish the axial location and 
alignment under all operating conditions. It is essential that 
a shoulder be square with the bearing ring and of sufﬁcient 
diameter and axial section to provide adequate backing of 
the bearing raceway. It also must be of sufﬁcient section to 
resist axial movement and excessive deﬂection under loading. 
Wear resistance at the interface with the bearing rings must 
be considered.
It is highly recommended that roller bearing shaft seats be ground 
to a surface ﬁnish of 1.6 μm (65 μin) Ra maximum. Ball bearing 
seats should be 0.8 μm (32 μin) for shafts under 2 inches and 
1.6 μm (65 μin) for all other sizes.
When shaft seats are turned, a tighter heavy-duty ﬁt should 
be selected to ensure interference ﬁt pressure and to prevent 
rotation. The shaft diameter should be turned to a ﬁnish of 3.2 μm 
(125 μin) Ra maximum.
Housing inside diameters  should be ﬁnished to 3.2 μm (125 μin) 
Ra maximum.
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS – 
TYPES TVL AND DTVL 
The TVL is a separable single-row angular contact ball bearing 
designed for unidirectional axial loads. The angular contact 
design, however, will accommodate combined radial and axial 
loads since the loads are transmitted angularly through the 
balls. The DTVL is similar in design to TVL except that the DTVL 
has an additional ring and ball complement permitting it to carry 
moderate forces in both directions.
To achieve expected bearing performance, it is critical to follow proper mounting design, ﬁtting 
practices, settings and installation procedures. While there are different practices between thrust 
tapered roller, cylindrical roller, spherical roller and ball bearings, there are many similarities that 
apply to all. These similarities are summarized in the sections below, followed by a summary of 
practices speciﬁc to each bearing type.
Both TVL and DTVL are used extensively in rotary table 
applications in the oil and gas drilling industry. Rotary table 
operation generates upward and downward axial loads while 
being supported and positioned by two main thrust bearings, 
often of the angular contact thrust ball type. The upper or main 
position takes the predominant downward axial  loads. The lower 
position, which also is known as the hold down bearing, handles 
the upward axial load and the majority of the radial loading due 
to gear forces or dynamic imbalance of the rotating components, 
ﬁxtures and drill pipe.
An example of arrangements of the angular contact thrust ball 
bearings includes using one size TVL in the main position, and 
another size in the lower position, as illustrated in ﬁg. 32. Another 
popular mounting arrangement is to use a single DTVL as a triple- 
ring combination bearing to handle thrust loads in both directions 
at the same time (see ﬁg. 33).

THRUST CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS –
TYPES TP AND TPS
Thrust cylindrical roller bearings are generally used in 
applications where high axial loads are present. Timken TP and 
TPS thrust cylindrical roller bearings are used in a variety of heavy 
industrial equipment and challenging thrust applications. Mineral 
and aggregate crushers and pulverizers are typical examples 
where thrust cylindrical roller bearings are used in primary 
thrust support positions to handle the loads applied during the 
compressive breakdown of aggregate (see ﬁg. 34). Dependent 
on mounting and axial force applications, these bearings can 
accommodate moderate overturning moments.
Fig. 34. Typical mounting arrangement of thrust cylindrical roller 
bearing in crusher application.
Mounting is typically handled by hoisting mechanisms in a shop 
environment, but may be assembled manually in the ﬁeld during 
replacement situations. Mounting of TP and TPS bearings with 
loose ﬁtting practice on both the shaft and housing is common 
to allow ease of installation. However, depending on bearing 
reaction torque, anti-rotation features may be required.
THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS – 
TYPE TSR
Thrust spherical roller bearings are used to support axial force 
in a wide variety of industrial machinery. They can be mounted 
at axial positions on vertical shafts (e.g. crushers), or mounted 
horizontally as in long product mill, ﬂat product mill, and cold mill 
works or intermediate rolls with axial shifting. These assemblies 
are best suited for applications where accommodation of heavy 
roll bending and high misalignment is required. Timken thrust 
spherical roller bearings are capable of handling misalign- 
ment between the inner and outer ring of up to 2.5 degrees in 
either direction.
Bearing outer rings must be mounted with a loose ﬁt to isolate 
radial loads when used as pure thrust bearings. When used in 
a shaft position and reacting to radial and axial forces, special 
housing ﬁtting practice is required. To support axial loads in both 
directions, thrust spherical roller bearings are often mounted in 
pairs. In such situations, a spring system maintains the outer 
races in contact with the rollers on the unloaded row. An axial 
clearance must be established during mounting using a shim 
pack between the chock and the cover. Housing components 
must be designed to accommodate preload springs or precision 
axial clearance setting.
A cartridge or adapter ring is sometimes used with the inner rings 
tight ﬁtted on a sleeve and the sleeve loose ﬁtted and keyed on 
the shaft (see ﬁgs. 35 and 36 for typical mountings of EJ and EM 
styles respectively).

Fig. 36. Face-to-face mounting arrangement of 
a TSR-EM bearing set.
To maximize axial load support in both directions, thrust spherical 
roller bearings are often mounted in a tandem face-to-face 
arrangement (see fig. 36-37). This configuration is common 
in rollneck applications in the metals industry. In such cases, 
the inner rings can be clamped in position against each other 
using inner ring spacers. In applications where surrounding 
components are mounted in close proximity to the bearing, 
special care must be taken so that such components do not 
encroach on the cage or rollers, and so that adequate clearance 
from the cage and rolling elements is maintained. If there is 
concern in this regard when mounting thrust spherical roller 
bearings, contact your Timken representative for support. 
Fig. 37. Typical tandem mount with inner ring spacers.
THRUST TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS –  
TYPE TTHD
Thrust tapered roller bearings of type TTHD or TTHDFL are used 
in a variety of applications such as plastic extruder thrust blocks, 
oil rig swivels, marine drives and machine tool tables. When 
mounted, the bearing should be square to the shaft and housing. 
The backing diameter must be sufﬁcient in the radial direction to 
support the full length of the rollers, both at the large and small 
roller ends, and of sufﬁcient axial section to prevent misalignment 
due to distortion.
In general, the rotating race is mounted with a tight shaft ﬁt, 
and the stationary race is mounted with a loose housing ﬁt. For 
TTHDFL, the ﬂat race may be loose ﬁt or tight ﬁt on its outer 
diameter depending on customer preference. 
The use of springs is sometimes required on horizontal axis 
applications where reversing axial loads or shock loads are 
encountered. Fig. 38 shows a spring-loaded TTHD bearing to 
keep the housing-supported race in contact with the rolling 
elements at all times.

3.  Flat-bottom race: If the bottom race is ﬂat (TTHDFLSX/SV), 
as in ﬁgs. 40-41, then apply close ﬁt as per ﬁtting practice 
guidelines. The ﬂat race permits radial self-aligning of the 
rollers and conical raceways.
4.  Sealing: An oil seal is mounted in the upper plate that is 
bolted to the cartridge to keep contaminants from entering 
the bearing assembly.
5.  Lubrication: Adequate lubrication is maintained by ﬁlling 
the bearing with high-quality EP grease having a viscosity of 
approximately 450 cSt at 40º C (104º F).

THRUST TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS – 
SCREWDOWN SYSTEMS –  
TYPES TTHDSX/SV AND TTHDFLSX/SV
Screwdown bearings of these types are used predominantly in 
metal mills. The bearings used in screwdown systems include 
single-row tapered thrust designs that are available in a variety 
of conﬁgurations (see pages 117-126 for further details). The 
heavy-duty thrust bearing makes the connection between the 
screwdown and the top roll chock, as shown in ﬁg. 39.
The operating speed of screwdown systems is very low during gap 
adjustment. Modern mills will either use the electromechanical 
screwdown system in conjunction with a hydraulic roll force 
cylinder, or will solely use the hydraulic roll force cylinder. The 
primary beneﬁt of hydraulic roll force cylinders is their fast 
response time compared to the electro-mechanical screwdown 
systems, but the mechanical system gives more precise location 
with small displacements.
When the mechanical system is used, the screwdown thrust 
bearing is applied between the main mill screw and top chock. 
The loads transmitted through these screwdown bearings are 
extremely high, typically equivalent to half of the mill's separating 
force, which can be several thousand tons. The operating speed 
is basically zero as the screw's rotational speed is very slow 
during adjustment. For this reason, the bearing selection is based 
on its static capacity (C0).
Below are a few important considerations to keep in mind when 
mounting screwdown bearings:
1.  Bearing cartridge: The bearing is mounted in a cartridge 
primarily to contain the lubricant needed for the assembly, 
but also to unitize the entire bearing assembly.
2.  Tapered-bottom race: If the bottom race is tapered (TTHDSX/
SV), then a 3 mm (0.120 in.) radial clearance is suggested 
relative to the O.D. of the race to ensure that the bottom 
race will self-align with respect to the upper tapered race. 
Otherwise, the roller ends will not be properly seated against 
both the upper and lower large ribs simultaneously. A piloting 
bushing is pressed into the cartridge and is used for centering 
the upper race and rollers. The bottom race will be centered 
by the upper race and roller set.

DOUBLE-ACTING HEAVY DUTY THRUST 
TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS –  
TYPES TTDWK AND TTDFLK
The TTDWK or TTDFLK double-acting thrust tapered roller 
bearing is an excellent choice where extremely high axial loads 
are anticipated.
Double-acting thrust tapered roller bearings are commonly used 
in strip mills that generate particularly large thrust forces, as is 
the case in cross rolling systems. 
The TTDWK (ﬁg. 42) bearing includes two ﬂat raceways – one on 
each side and one tapered double-race thrust ring at the center 
of the bearing, as well as two sets of rollers that are retained as 
a unit in a pinned cage.
The TTDFLK (ﬁg. 43), a variant to this TTDWK conﬁguration, uses 
two tapered raceways (one on each side) and a ﬂat, double-race 
thrust ring at its center.
Fig. 42. Typical TTDWK 
assembly (with ﬂat 
outer raceways).
Fig. 43. Typical TTDFLK 
assembly (with ﬂat 
double inner raceways).
Fig. 44. Typical TTDWK thrust bearing arrangement.
The TTDWK double-acting thrust bearing is usually mounted in 
combination with a radial bearing at the ﬁxed position (ﬁg. 44). 
Such an assembly is ﬁtted in a separate housing that will be 
mounted on the chock. The outer races are not axially clamped, 
but adjusted to obtain the required axial clearance, allowing the 
springs to develop the correct axial force to seat the unloaded 
row. A keyway is generally provided in the center double-race 
ring to stop it from rotating on the roll neck.
The TTDFLK bearing, on the other hand, is preset and does not 
require adjustment during mounting. If the bearing is supplied 
without a spacer, then the same spring arrangement and 
adjustment as the TTDWK must be used.
The assembly must be axially clamped using metal shims or a 
compressible gasket, as shown in ﬁg. 45. This bearing can also 
be ordered without the spacer and then mount it like the TTDWK 
(ﬁg. 46).
These double-acting bearings (TTDWK and TTDFLK) can only 
be installed as a unit. Take care to ensure that the ﬂat races are 
correctly centered when lifting or lowering this bearing into the 
housing.

CROSSED ROLLER BEARINGS 
TXR (DO)
A typical mounting arrangement for the type TXRDO crossed roller 
bearing is shown in ﬁg. 47.
The arrangement shown is for lubrication by oil circulation in 
conjunction with an oil level maintained within the bearing. It 
can, however, be designed for grease lubrication with appropriate 
sealing arrangements.
The bore of the housing (DH) and the diameter of the spigot (DS) 
(ﬁg. 48) should be machined to give a mean of the suggested 
interference ﬁts (pages 48-49).
The bearing is adjusted externally by segments beneath the top 
inner-ring clamping plate to get the required preload.
Your Timken engineer should be consulted for more details about 
the use of crossed roller bearings.

 TIMKEN
® THRUST BEARING CATALOG  43
FITTING PRACTICE 
As a general guideline, bearing rings mounted on a rotating 
member should have an interference ﬁt. For some thrust bearing 
applications, the ring is pinned to the rotating shaft. Loose ﬁts 
may permit the ring to creep or turn and wear the mating surface 
and backing shoulder. This wear can result in excessive bearing 
looseness which can lead to damage of the bearing, shaft or 
housing. Many thrust bearing applications have outer rings 
mounted with a clearance to insulate them from radial loads and 
to allow axial ﬂoat. 
The choice of ﬁtting practices will mainly depend upon the 
following parameters:
 • Precision class of the bearing.
 • Rotating or stationary ring.
 • Type of layout (single- or double-row bearings).
 • Type and direction of load (continuous/alternate rotating, 
overturning moments).
 • Particular running conditions like shocks, vibrations,  
overloading or high speed.
 • Capability for machining the seats (grinding, turning 
or boring).
 • Shaft and housing section and material.
 • Mounting and setting conditions.
General ﬁtting practice guidelines for thrust bearings having  
a bore less than 304.8 mm (12 in.) are:
Rotating race
• Use a tight ﬁt with horizontal shafts;  
vertical shafts may consider split or loose ﬁt.
• Use a clearance with housing.

NOTE
When one ring is piloted by the housing, sufﬁcient clearances 
must be allowed at the outside diameter of the other ring 
as well as at the bore of both rings to prevent cross-loading 
of the rollers. For most applications, this clearance is 
approximately 1.588 mm (0.0625 in.).

® THRUST BEARING CATALOG   
SETTING 
Thrust bearings are typically set up against another bearing with 
the setting determined by the application requirements. Most 
thrust bearings operate under a preload condition.
Correct bearing mounting and fitting practices are key 
components of proper bearing setting.
INSTALLATION
Proper bearing installation, including cleanliness of the 
components, as well as use of proper tools, is critical to 
bearing performance.
Cleanliness of the bearing and mating components is essential 
for a bearing to achieve maximum service life. Burrs, foreign 
material and any raised portions of the components mating with 
the bearing can cause misalignment. Care should be taken to 
avoid these conditions. Shafts and housings, including lubrication 
holes, should be thoroughly cleaned before bearing installation. 
If blind holes are present, insert a magnetic rod to remove metal 
chips that might have accumulated during manufacture. An air 
hose may be used on shafts and housings, but should not be used 
on bearings. Bearings in their shipping containers are typically 
coated with a rust-inhibitive oil. This oil is compatible with most 
lubricants and does not need to be removed prior to installation.
Adequate tools must be used to properly ﬁt the inner rings onto 
the shaft and outer rings into the housing to avoid damage. 
Direct impact on the rings must be avoided. Inspection of ﬁllets 
and undercuts should be completed prior to assembly to ensure 
proper clearance with the bearing.
If applications require a tight interference ﬁt of one or both rings, 
it is acceptable to heat or cool rings to ease assembly. Standard 
bearings should not be heated above 120° C (250° F) or cooled 
below -55° C (-65° F). Precision bearings should not be heated 
above 65° C (150° F) or cooled below -30° C (-20° F). An alternate 
method of mounting, generally used on smaller sizes, is to press 
the bearing onto the shaft or into the housing using an arbor press.
For more information on these installation procedures, please 
contact your Timken engineer.
NOTE: 
The products cataloged are application speciﬁc. Any use in 
applications other than those intended could lead to 
equipment failure or to reduced equipment life.                            
Use of improper bearing ﬁts may cause damage to equipment.     
Do not use damaged bearings. The use of a damaged bearing 
can result in equipment damage.

Failure to observe the following warnings  
could create a risk of death or serious injury.
Proper maintenance and handling practices are critical.  
Always follow installation instructions and maintain  
proper lubrication.
Overheated bearings can ignite explosive atmospheres.  
Special care must be taken to properly select, install,  
maintain, and lubricate housed unit bearings that are used in  
or near atmospheres that may contain explosive levels  
of combustible gases or accumulations of dust such as from 
grain, coal, or other combustible materials. 
Consult your equipment designer or supplier for installation  
and maintenance instructions.
WARNING

Failure to observe the following warnings  
could create a risk of death or serious injury.
Never spin a bearing with compressed air. 
The components may be forcefully expelled.
 Proper maintenance and handling practices are critical. 
Always follow installation instructions and 
maintain proper lubrication.

BEARING OPERATION
OPERATING TEMPERATURES
Bearings operate in a wide range of applications and environments. 
In most cases, bearing operating temperature is not an issue. 
Some applications, however, operate at extreme speeds or in 
extreme temperature environments. In these cases, care must 
be taken not to exceed the temperature limits of the bearing. 
Minimum temperature limits are primarily based on lubricant 
capability. Maximum temperature limits are most often based 
on material and/or lubricant constraints, but also may be based 
on accuracy requirements of the equipment that the bearings 
are built into. These constraints/limitations are discussed below.
BEARING MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
Standard bearing steels with a standard heat treatment cannot 
maintain a minimum hardness of 58 HRC much above 120° C 
(250° F). 
Dimensional stability of Timken bearings is managed through the 
proper selection of an appropriate heat-treat process. Standard 
Timken ball bearings are dimensionally stabilized  from -54° C (-65° 
F) up to 120° C (250° F). Upon request, these bearings can be ordered 
to higher levels of stability as listed below. These designations are 
in agreement with DIN Standard 623.

With dimensionally stabilized product, there still may be some 
changes in dimensions during service as a result of microstructural 
transformations. These transformations include the continued 
tempering of martensite and decomposition of retained austenite. 
The magnitude of change depends on the operating temperature, 
the time at temperature and the composition and heat-treatment of 
the steel.
Temperatures exceeding the limits shown in table 27 require 
special high-temperature steel. Consult your Timken engineer for 
availability of speciﬁc part numbers for non-standard heat stability 
or high-temperature steel grades.
Suggested materials for use in balls, rings and rollers at various 
operating temperatures are listed in table 28. Also listed 
are chemical composition suggestions, hardness suggestions 
and dimensional stability information. 
Operating temperature affects lubricant ﬁlm thickness and setting, 
both of which directly influence bearing life. Extremely high 
temperatures can result in a reduced ﬁlm thickness that can lead 
to asperity contact between contacting surfaces.
Operating temperature also can affect performance of cages, 
seals and shields, which in turn can affect bearing performance. 
Materials for these components and their operating temperature 
ranges are shown in table 28.
LUBRICATION LIMITATIONS
Starting torque in grease-lubricated applications typically increases 
signiﬁcantly at cold temperatures. Starting torque is not primarily 
a function of the consistency or channel properties of the grease. 
Most often, it is a function of the rheological properties of the grease. 
The high-temperature limit for greases is generally a function of the 
thermal and oxidation stability of the base oil in the grease and the 
effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors. 
See the LUBRICATION section on page 55 for more information 
on lubrication limitations.
EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The equipment designer must evaluate the effects of temperature 
on the performance of the equipment being designed. Precision 
machine tool spindles, for example, can be very sensitive to thermal 
expansions. For some spindles, it is important that the temperature 
rise over ambient be held to 20° C to 35° C (36° F to 45° F). 
Most industrial equipment can operate at considerably higher 
temperatures. Thermal ratings on gear drives, for example, are 
based on 93° C (200° F). Equipment such as gas turbines operates 
continuously at temperatures above 100° C (212° F). Running at high 
temperatures for extended periods of time, however, may affect 
shaft and housing ﬁts if the shaft and housing are not machined and 
heat-treated properly.

Although bearings can operate satisfactorily up to 120° C (250° F), 
an upper temperature limit of 80° C to 95° C (176° F to 203° F) is more 
practical. Higher operating temperatures increase the risk of 
damage from transient temperature spikes. Prototype testing of the 
application can help deﬁne the operating temperature range and 
should be conducted if possible. It is the responsibility of the 
equipment designer to weigh all relevant factors and make the ﬁnal 
determination of satisfactory operating temperature.

Bearing operating temperature is dependent upon a number 
of factors, including heat generation of all contributing heat 
sources, heat ﬂow rate between sources and the ability of the 
system to dissipate the heat. Heat sources include such things as 
bearings, seals, gears, clutches and oil supply. Heat dissipation is 
affected by many factors, including shaft and housing materials 
and designs, lubricant circulation and external environmental 
conditions. These and other factors are discussed in the following 
sections. 
HEAT GENERATION
Under normal operating conditions, most of the torque and heat 
generated by the bearing is caused by the elastohydrodynamic 
losses at the roller/ring contacts.
Heat generation is the product of bearing torque (M) and speed 
(n). The following equation is used to calculate the heat generated.

Qgen   =  k4n M
Where:

k4 =  0.105 for Qgen in W when M in N-m

=  6.73 x 10-4 for Qgen in Btu/min when M in lbf-in.
If the bearing is tapered, the torque can be calculated using the 
following equation.

M  =  k1G1 (nμ)0.5 (Fa) 0.3
Where:

k1  =  bearing torque constant

=  7.97 x 10-6 for M in N-m

=  1.1 x 10-4 for M in lbf-in.

Fa  =  thrust load

μ  =  lubricant viscosity

G1  =  bearing geometry factor

(Part-speciﬁc; please contact your Timken    

representative.)
For thrust cylindrical and spherical roller bearings, the torque 
equations are given as follows, where the coefﬁcients are based 
on series and found table 29:

M =     f1 Fa dm + 10-7 f0 (v x n)2/3 dm3  if (v x n)  2000

   f1 Fa dm + 160 x 10-7 f0 dm3  if (v x n) < 2000
Note that the viscosity is in units of centistokes and dm is the 
mean bearing diameter.

HEAT DISSIPATION
The problem of determining the heat ﬂow from a bearing in a 
speciﬁc application is rather complex. In general, it can be said 
that factors affecting the rate of heat dissipation include the 
following:
1.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the housing. This is 
affected by size conﬁguration of the house and any external 
cooling such as fans, water cooling or fan action of the rotating 
components.
2.  Temperature gradient from the bearing to the shaft. Any other 
heat sources, such as gears and additional bearings and 
their proximity to the bearing considered, will inﬂuence the 
temperature of the shaft.
3.  The heat carried away by a circulating oil system. 
To what extent nos. 1 and 2 can be controlled will depend on 
the application. The heat-dissipation modes include conduction 
through the system, convection along the inside and outside 
surfaces of the system, as well as radiation exchange to and 
from neighboring structures. In many applications, overall heat 
dissipation can be divided into two categories – heat removed by 
circulating oil and heat removed through the structure.

The amount of heat removed by the lubricant can be controlled 
more easily. In a splash lubrication system, cooling coils may be 
used to control the bulk oil temperature.
The amount of heat carried away in a circulating oil system by 
the lubricant can be approximated from the following equations.

Qoil  = 1.67 x10-5 v Cp (o - i)

To help maintain a bearing’s antifriction 
characteristics, lubrication is needed to:
 • Minimize rolling resistance due to deformation 
of the rolling elements and raceway under load by 
separating the mating surfaces.
 • Minimize sliding friction occurring between rolling 
elements, raceways and cage.
 • Transfer heat (with oil lubrication).
 • Protect from corrosion and, with grease lubrication, 
from contaminant ingress.

The wide range of bearing types and operating conditions 
precludes any simple, all-inclusive statement or guideline for 
selecting the proper lubricant. At the design level, the ﬁrst 
consideration is whether oil or grease is best for the particular 
operation. The advantages of oil and grease are outlined in 
table 30. When heat must be carried away from the bearing, oil 
must be used. Oil is almost always preferred for very high-speed 
applications.

OIL LUBRICATION
Oils used for bearing lubrication should be high-quality mineral 
oils or synthetic oils with similar properties. Selection of the 
proper type of oil depends on bearing speed, load, operating 
temperature and lubrication method. In addition to the above, 
some features and advantages of oil lubrication are:
 • Oil is a better lubricant for high speeds or high tempera-
tures. It can be cooled to help reduce bearing temperature.
 • It is easier to handle and control the amount of lubricant 
reaching the bearing. It is harder to retain in the bearing. 
Lubricant losses may be higher than with grease.
 • Oil can be introduced to the bearing in many ways, such as 
drip-feed, wick-feed, pressurized circulating systems, oil bath 
or air-oil mist. Each is suited for certain types of applications.
 • Oil is easier to keep clean for recirculating systems.
Oil may be introduced to the bearing housing in many ways. The 
most common systems are:
 • Oil bath. The housing is designed to provide a sump 
through which the rolling elements of the bearing will pass. 
Generally, the oil level should be no higher than the center 
point of the lowest rolling element. If speed is high, lower  
oil levels should be used to reduce churning. Gages or  
controlled elevation drains are used to achieve and  
maintain the proper oil level.
 • Circulating system. This system has the advantages of:
• An adequate supply of oil for both cooling and 
lubrication.
• Metered control of the quantity of oil delivered to each 
bearing.
• Removal of contaminants and moisture from the 
bearing by ﬂushing action.
• Suitability for multiple bearing installations.
• Large reservoir, which reduces deterioration.
• Increased lubricant life provides economical 
efﬁciency.
• Incorporation of oil-ﬁltering devices.
• Positive control to deliver the lubricant where needed.
• A typical circulating oil system consists of an oil 
reservoir, pump, piping and ﬁlter. A heat exchange may 
be required. 
 • Oil-mist lubrication. Oil-mist lubrication systems are used in 
high-speed, continuous-operation applications. This system 
permits close control of the amount of lubricant reaching the 
bearings. The oil may be metered, atomized by compressed 
air and mixed with air, or picked up from a reservoir using a 
venturi effect. In either case, the air is ﬁltered and supplied 
under sufﬁcient pressure to ensure adequate lubrication of 
the bearings. Control of this type of lubrication system is  
accomplished by monitoring the operating temperatures of 
the bearings being lubricated. The continuous passage of 
the pressurized air and oil through the labyrinth seals used 
in the system prevents the entrance of contaminants from 
the atmosphere to the system.
The successful operation of this type of system is based 
upon the following factors: 
• Proper location of the lubricant entry ports in relation 
to the bearings being lubricated.
• Avoidance of excessive pressure drops across void 
spaces within the system.

Lubricating oils are commercially available in many forms for 
automotive, industrial, aircraft and other uses. Oils are classiﬁed 
as either petroleum types (reﬁned from crude oil) or synthetic 
types (produced by chemical synthesis).
PETROLEUM OILS 
Petroleum oils are made from a petroleum hydrocarbon derived 
from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. 
Petroleum oils are used for nearly all oil-lubricated applications 
of bearings. 
SYNTHETIC OILS
Synthetic oils cover a broad range of categories and include 
polyalphaoleﬁns, silicones, polyglycols and various esters. In 
general, synthetic oils are less prone to oxidation and can operate 
at extreme hot or cold temperatures. Physical properties, such as 
pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients, tend to vary between oil types; 
use caution when making oil selections.
The polyalphaoleﬁns (PAO) have a hydrocarbon chemistry that 
parallels petroleum oil both in chemical structures and pressure-
viscosity coefﬁcients. Therefore, PAO oil is mostly used in the 
oil-lubricated applications of bearings when severe temperature 
environments (hot and cold) are encountered or when extended 
lubricant life is required. 
The silicone, ester and polyglycol oils have an oxygen-based 
chemistry that is structurally quite different from petroleum 
oils and PAO oils. This difference has a profound effect on its 
physical properties where pressure-viscosity coefﬁcients can 
be lower compared to mineral and PAO oils. This means that 
these types of synthetic oils may actually generate a smaller 
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) ﬁlm thickness than a mineral or PAO 
oil of equal viscosity at operating temperature. Reductions in 
bearing fatigue life and increases in bearing wear could result 
from this reduction of lubricant ﬁlm thickness.
VISCOSITY
The selection of oil viscosity for any bearing application requires 
consideration of several factors: load, speed, bearing setting, 
type of oil and environmental factors. Since oil viscosity varies 
inversely with temperature, a viscosity value must always be 
stated with the temperature at which it was determined. High- 
viscosity oil is used for low-speed or high-ambient-temperature 
applications. Low-viscosity oil is used for high-speed or low-
ambient-temperature applications.
There are several classiﬁcations of oils based on viscosity grades. 
The most familiar are the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
classiﬁcations for automotive engine and gear oils. The American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) have adopted standard 
viscosity grades for industrial ﬂuids. Fig. 49 shows the viscosity 
comparisons of ISO/ASTM with SAE classiﬁcation systems at 
40° C (104° F).

• Proper air pressure and oil quantity ratio to suit the  
particular application.
• Adequate exhaust of the air-oil mist after lubrication 
has been accomplished. 
To ensure “wetting” of the bearings, and to prevent possible 
damage to the rolling elements and rings, it is imperative that 
the oil-mist system be turned on for several minutes before the 
equipment is started. The importance of “wetting” the bearing 
before starting cannot be overstated, and it also has particular 
signiﬁcance for equipment that has been idled for extended 
periods of time.

Industrial EP gear oils should be composed of a highly reﬁned 
petroleum oil-based stock plus appropriate inhibitors and 
additives. They should not contain materials that are corrosive 
or abrasive to bearings. The inhibitors should provide long-term 
protection from oxidation and protect the bearing from corrosion 
in the presence of moisture. The oils should resist foaming in 
service and have good water-separation properties. An EP 
additive protects against scoring under boundary-lubrication 
conditions. The viscosity grades suggested represent a wide 
range. High-temperature and/or slow-speed applications 
generally require the higher viscosity grades. Low temperatures 
and/or high speeds require the use of lower viscosity grades.

GREASE LUBRICATION
Grease lubrication is generally applicable to low-to-moderate 
speed applications that have operating temperatures within the 
limits of the grease. There is no universal antifriction bearing 
grease. Each grease has limiting properties and characteristics.
Greases consist of a base oil, a thickening agent and additives. 
Conventionally, bearing greases have consisted of petroleum 
base oils thickened to the desired consistency by some form of 
metallic soap. More recently synthetic base oils have been used 
with organic and inorganic thickeners. Table 33 summarizes the

Calcium- and aluminum-based greases have excellent water

are used in industrial applications and wheel bearings. 
Synthetic-based oils such as esters, organic esters and silicones 
used with conventional thickeners and additives typically have 
higher maximum operating temperatures than petroleum-based 
greases. Synthetic greases can be designed to operate in 
temperatures from -73° C (-100° F) to 288° C (550° F).

Use of the thickeners in table 34 with synthetic hydrocarbon or 
ester base oils increases the maximum operating temperature 
by approximately 10° C (50° F).
Using polyurea as a thickener for lubricating ﬂuids is one of the 
most signiﬁcant lubrication developments in more than 30 years. 
Polyurea grease performance is outstanding in a wide range of 
bearing applications and, in a relatively short time, it has gained 
acceptance as a factory-packed lubricant for ball bearings.
LOW TEMPERATURES
Starting torque in a grease-lubricated bearing at low temperatures 
can be critical. Some greases may function adequately as long 
as the bearing is operating, but resistance to initial movement 
may be excessive. In certain smaller machines, starting may be 
impossible when very cold. Under such operating circumstances, 
greases containing low-temperature characteristic oils are 
generally required.
If the operating temperature range is wide, synthetic greases 
offer advantages. Synthetic greases are available to provide very 
low starting and running torque at temperatures as low as -73° 
C (-100° F). In certain instances, these greases perform better in 
this respect than oil.
An important point concerning lubricating greases is that the 
starting torque is not necessarily a function of the consistency 
or the channel properties of the grease. Starting torque is more 
a function of the individual rheological properties of a particular 
grease and is best evaluated by application experience.
HIGH TEMPERATURES
The high temperature limit for lubricating greases is generally 
a function of the thermal and oxidation stability of the ﬂuid and 
the effectiveness of the oxidation inhibitors. Grease temperature 
ranges are deﬁned by both the dropping point of the grease 
thickener and composition of the base oil. Table 35 shows 
the temperature ranges of various base oils used in grease 
formulations. 
A rule of thumb, developed from years of testing grease-
lubricated bearings, indicates that grease life is halved for every 
10° C (50° F) increase in temperature. For example, if a particular 
grease provides 2000 hours of life at 90° C (194° F), by raising the 
temperature to 100° C (212° F), reduction in life to approximately 
1000 hours would result. On the other hand, 4000 hours could be 
expected by lowering the temperature to 80° C (176° F).

Thermal stability, oxidation resistance and temperature limitations 
must be considered when selecting greases for high-temperature 
applications. In non-relubricatable applications, highly reﬁned 
mineral oils or chemically stable synthetic ﬂuids are required 
as the oil component of greases for operation at temperatures 
above 121° C (250° F).
CONTAMINATION
Abrasive Particles
When roller bearings operate in a clean environment, the primary 
cause of damage is the eventual fatigue of the surfaces where 
rolling contact occurs. However, when particle contamination 
enters the bearing system, it is likely to cause damage such as 
bruising, which can shorten bearing life.
When dirt from the environment or metallic wear debris from 
some component in the application is allowed to contaminate 
the lubricant, wear can become the predominant cause of 
bearing damage. If bearing wear becomes signiﬁcant, changes 
will occur to critical bearing dimensions that could adversely 
affect machine operation.
Bearings operating in a contaminated lubricant exhibit a higher 
initial rate of wear than those running in an uncontaminated 
lubricant. With no further contaminant ingress, this wear rate 
quickly diminishes. The contamination particles are reduced 
in size as they pass through the bearing contact area during 
normal operation.
Water
Water and moisture can be particularly conducive to bearing 
damage. Lubricating greases may provide a measure of 
protection from this contamination. Certain greases, such as 
calcium and aluminum-complex, are highly water-resistant.
Sodium-soap greases are water-soluble and should not be used 
in applications involving water.
Dissolved or suspended water in lubricating oils can exert a 
detrimental inﬂuence on bearing fatigue life. Water can cause 
bearing etching that also can reduce bearing fatigue life. The 
exact mechanism by which water lowers fatigue life is not fully 
understood. It has been suggested that water enters micro-cracks 
in the bearing rings that are caused by repeated stress cycles. 
This leads to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement in the micro-
cracks, reducing the time required for these cracks to propagate 
to an unacceptable-sized spall.
Water-based ﬂuids, such as water glycol and invert emulsions, 
also have shown a reduction in bearing fatigue life. Although 
water from these sources is not the same as contamination, 
the results support the previous discussion concerning water-
contaminated lubricants.
GREASE SELECTION
The successful use of bearing grease depends on the physical 
and chemical properties of the lubricant as well as application 
and environmental conditions. Because the choice of grease 
for a particular bearing under certain service conditions is often 
difﬁcult to make, you should consult with your lubricant supplier 
or equipment maker for speciﬁc questions about lubrication 
requirements for your application. You also can contact your 
Timken engineer for general lubrication guidelines for any 
application.
Grease must be carefully selected with regard to its consistency 
at operating temperature. It should not exhibit thickening, 
separation of oil, acid formation or hardening to any marked 
degree. It should be smooth, non-ﬁbrous and entirely free from 
chemically active ingredients. Its dropping point should be 
considerably higher than the operating temperature.

TABLE 36. GREASE LUBRICATION SELECTION GUIDE
Timken® application-speciﬁc lubricants were developed by leveraging our knowledge of tribology 
and anti-friction bearings, and how these two elements affect overall system performance. 
Timken® lubricants help bearings and related components operate effectively in demanding 
industrial operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant additives offer superior 
protection in challenging environments. Table 36 provides an overview of the Timken greases 
available for general applications. Contact your Timken engineer for a more detailed publication 
on Timken® lubrication solutions.
Many bearing applications require lubricants with special properties or lubricants 
formulated speciﬁcally for certain environments, such as:
 • Friction oxidation (fretting corrosion).
 • Chemical and solvent resistance.
 • Food handling.
For assistance with these or other areas requiring special lubricants, consult your 
Timken engineer.
 • Quiet running.
 • Space and/or vacuum.
 • Electrical conductivity.

GREASE USE GUIDELINES
It is important to use the proper amount of grease in the 
application. In typical industrial applications, the bearing cavity 
should be kept approximately one-third to one-half full. Less 
grease may result in the bearing being starved for lubrication. 
More grease may result in churning. Both conditions may result 
in excessive temperature. As the grease temperature rises, 
viscosity decreases and the grease becomes thinner. This can 
reduce the lubricating effect and increase leakage of the grease 
from the bearing. It also may cause the grease components 
to separate, leading to a general breakdown of the lubricant 
properties. As the grease breaks down, bearing torque increases. 
In the case of excess grease resulting in churning, torque may 
also increase due to the resistance caused by the grease. 
For best results, there should be ample space in the housing to 
allow room for excess grease to be thrown from the bearing. 
However, it is equally important that the grease be retained all 
around the bearing. If a large void exists between the bearings, 
grease closures should be used to prevent the grease from 
leaving the bearing area.
Only in low-speed applications may the housing be entirely ﬁlled 
with grease. This method of lubrication is a safeguard against the 
entry of foreign matter, where sealing provisions are inadequate 
for exclusion of contaminants or moisture.
During periods of non-operation, it is often wise to completely ﬁll 
the housings with grease to protect the bearing surfaces. Prior 
to restarting operation, remove the excess grease and restore 
the proper level.
Applications utilizing grease lubrication should have a grease 
ﬁtting and a vent at opposite ends of the housing near the top. A 
drain plug should be located near the bottom of the housing to 
allow the old grease to purge from the bearing.
Bearings should be relubricated at regular intervals to prevent 
damage. Relubrication intervals are difﬁcult to determine. If plant 
practice or experience with other applications is not available, 
consult your lubricant supplier.
Timken offers a range of lubricants to help bearings and 
related components operate effectively in demanding industrial 
operations. High-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant 
additives offer greater protection in challenging environments. 
Timken also offers a line of single- and multi-point lubricators to 
simplify grease delivery.
Grease application methods
Grease, in general, is easier to use than oil in industrial bearing 
lubrication applications. Most bearings that are initially packed 
with grease require periodic relubrication to operate efﬁciently.
Grease should be packed into the bearing so that it gets between 
the rolling elements – the rollers or balls. For tapered roller 
bearings, forcing grease through the bearing from the large end 
to the small end will ensure proper distribution.
Grease can be easily packed into small- and medium-size 
bearings by hand (ﬁg. 51). In shops where bearings are frequently 
regreased, a mechanical grease packer that forces grease 
through the bearing under pressure may be appropriate  (ﬁg. 52).
Regardless of the method, after packing the internal areas of the 
bearing, a small amount of grease also should be smeared on the 
outside of the rollers or balls.
The two primary considerations that determine the relubrication 
cycle are operating temperature and sealing efﬁciency. High- 
operating-temperature applications generally require more 
frequent regreasing. The less efﬁcient the seals, the greater 
the grease loss and the more frequently grease must be added. 
Grease should be added any time the amount in the bearing 
falls below the desired amount. The grease should be replaced 
when its lubrication properties have been reduced through 
contamination, high temperature, water, oxidation or any other 
factors. For additional information on appropriate regreasing 
cycles, consult with the equipment manufacturer or your Timken 
engineer.

CONSISTENCY
Greases may vary in consistency from semi-ﬂuids that are hardly 
thicker than a viscous oil to solid grades almost as hard as a 
soft wood.
Consistency is measured by a penetrometer in which a standard 
weighted cone is dropped into the grease. The distance the cone 
penetrates (measured in tenths of a millimeter in a speciﬁc time) 
is the penetration number.
The National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) classiﬁcation 
of grease consistency is shown below:
TABLE 37. NLGI CLASSIFICATIONS
NLGI Grease Grades
Penetration Number

355-385

265-295
3
220-250
4
175-205
5
130-160
6
85-115
Grease consistency is not ﬁxed; it normally becomes softer 
when sheared or “worked.” In the laboratory, this “working” is 
accomplished by forcing a perforated plate up and down through 
a closed container of grease. This “working” does not compare 
with the violent shearing action that takes place in a bearing and 
does not necessarily correlate with actual performance.

TYPE TPS
• Two or three cylindrical rollers per cage pocket to enhance 
true rolling motion and prevent roller skewing.
• Similar to type TP except one washer is spherically ground 
to seat against an aligning ring which makes the bearing 
assembly adaptable to initial misalignment.
• Not suggested for operating conditions where alignment is 
constantly changing.

THRUST SPHERICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
TYPES TSR-EJ AND TSR-EM
• Designed to achieve high thrust capacity with low friction and continuous 
roller alignment.
• Utilize spherically contoured rollers arranged in a steep angular  
conﬁguration to accommodate high thrust load alone, or in combination 
with moderate radial loads.
• Low friction of the bearing results from a combination of bearing geometry 
and manufacturing technology.
• Possess inherent dynamic misalignment capabilities up to 2.5 degrees 
between shaft and housing.
• Design variants include bearings with steel cage (EJ) or brass cage (EM).

DESIGN TYPES
TSR-EJ 
• Spherical inner and outer races.
• Utilizes window-type steel cage which unitizes the cage 
and roller assembly with the inner ring via cage tabs.
• Optimized internal geometry, roller design and surface 
ﬁnishing to minimize torque and heat generation, improve 
lubrication, and maximize load capacity.
TSR-EM
• Spherical inner and outer races.
• Utilizes large end roller-riding brass cage design which  
enhances lubrication ﬂow and enables maximized roller 
length to provide high thrust load capacity within the 
envelope.
• Roller-cage assembly is unitized to the inner ring via a steel 
cage band for easier bearing mounting and handling.

THRUST BEARING DATA
TIMKEN
® THRUST BEARING CATALOG   99
TYPE TTHDFL
• Consists of one thrust tapered race, one ﬂat race, rollers and cage.
• Most sizes utilize pin-type cages with hardened pins through the center of the rollers,  
allowing closer roller spacing to maximize load capacity.
• Smaller sizes have brass cages designed for unidirectional retention of rollers.
• Combines the outstanding features of thrust tapered and cylindrical roller bearings to 
offer the highest possible load capacity of any thrust bearing of its size.
• Originally developed for screwdown applications in metal rolling mills where high 
axial loads are common.
OVERALL DIMENSIONS:

® THRUST BEARING CATALOG   105
TYPE TTHDFLSA
• Same basic roller and raceway design as the TTHDFL, except  
that the lower race is composed of two pieces whose faces are  
spherically ground to permit self-alignment under conditions of 
initial misalignment.
• TTHDFLSA bearings should not be used if dynamic misalignment 
(changing under load) is expected.
OVERALL DIMENSIONS:
d –  Bore diameter
D  – Bearing O.D. 
T  –  Bearing width
T1  –  Ring thickness
d1  –  Large bore I.D.
D1  –  Small diameter O.D.
E  –  Housing shoulder diameter
H  –  Shaft shoulder diameter
r  –  Shaft/housing maximum ﬁllet radius
