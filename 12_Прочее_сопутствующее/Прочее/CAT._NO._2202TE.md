1. Construction and Characteristics of 
Rolling Bearings
1.1 Rolling bearing construction
Most rolling bearings consist of rings with raceways(an 
inner and an outer ring), rolling elements(either balls or rollers) 
and a cage. The cage separates the rolling elements at regular 
intervals, holds them in place within the inner and outer 
raceways, and allows them to rotate freely. See Fig. 1.1.
Theoretically, rolling bearings are so constructed as to 
allow the rolling elements to rotate orbitally while also rotating 
on their own axes at the same time.
While the rolling elements and the bearing rings take 
any load applied to the bearings (at the contact point between 
the rolling elements and raceway surfaces), the cage takes no 
direct load. It only serves to hold the rolling elements at equal 
distances from each other and prevent them from falling out.
1.2 Deep groove ball bearings
Deep groove ball bearings are very widely used. A deep 
groove is formed on each inner and outer ring of the bearing 
enabling them to sustain radial and axial loads in either 
direction as well as the combined loads which result from the 
combination of these forces. Deep groove ball bearings are 
suitable for high speed applications. In addition to the open 
type, deep groove ball bearings come in a number of varieties, 
including pre-lubricated bearings, bearings with one or both 
sides sealed or shielded, bearings with snap rings and high

bearing is shown in Fig. 1.2.
As shown in Table 1.1, pressed cages are generally used 
in deep groove ball bearings. However, machined cages are 
also used in larger sized bearings designed for high speed 
applications.
1.2.1 Shielded ball bearings 
Shielded ball bearings are deep groove ball bearings 
having the same boundary dimensions as those of open type 
bearings. Protection against the penetration of foreign material 
and the prevention of grease leakage are provided by the steel 
shield of these bearings.

side. Since the shields are non-contact type, friction torque is 
very low.
1.2.2 Sealed ball bearings 
Like shielded ball bearings, sealed ball bearings have the 
same boundary dimensions as those of the open type bearings. 
Sealed ball bearings also have the function of keeping foreign 
matter out and grease in with seals.
Seals consisting of synthetic rubber molded to a steel 
plate are incorporated into the outer rings of these ball

bearings. There are two major types of sealed bearings: 
contact type and non-contact type sealed bearings. The LLU 
type is equipped with two contact seals, one on each side of 
the bearings while the LLB type uses non-contact type seals 
instead. Similar construction to LLU type, the LLH type sealed 
bearings perform better low torque characteristics than that of 
LLU type because of its special lip design. Basically, bearings 
with contact seals have excellent and effective functions of

with this bearing.
1.2.4 CSB ball bearings
CSB bearings have the same boundary dimensions as 
standard deep groove ball bearings, but have undergone a 
special heat treatment that considerably extends wear life. 
These bearings are especially effective in countering reduced 
wear life due to the effects of infiltration by dust and other 
foreign matter. CSB 62 series bearings can be used in place 
of standard 63 series bearings enabling lighter weight, more 
compact designs.

1.2.5 ESB bearings
ESB bearings have the same boundary dimensions 
as standard deep groove ball bearings, but have undergone 
a special heat treatment and surface structure stabilization 
with nitrogen under the proper material and conditions. ESB 
bearings are designed to be able to withstand in the harsh 
lubrication condition containing hard foreign matter. These 
bearings enhance wear property and fatigue life even superior 
to CSB bearings under such condition.
1.2.6 AC bearings (creep prevention bearings) 
AC bearings have the same boundary dimensions as 
standard bearings with the addition of two O-rings imbedded 
in the outside circumference of the outer ring. This bearing has 
a steel housing, can withstand rotating outer ring loads, and 
is suitable for applications where a “tight fit” is not possible 
but the fear of creeping exists. With its capacity for axial load

1.2.7 TS bearings
Special care is needed for bearings used in high operating 
temperature, such as 120°C and above. The TS bearings are 
designed to accommodate such strict condition. These TS 
bearings are dimension stabilized and can withstand  operation 
with high temperature up to 250°C.
1.2.8 Low noise bearings
The smaller sizes of series 60 and 62 with shields and 
seals are also available in a special low noise quality for 
applications where silent running is of prime importance, such 
as the application of fan motors in air conditioning. The low 
noise bearings require good running accuracy and made by 
improved washing and assembly manufacturing process. In 
addition, the bearings are usually pre-lubricated with low noise 
grease. 
In order to prevent fretting corrosion on raceways and 
balls of bearings due to poor transportation condition in some 
areas, the grease with good fretting resistance and low noise 
characteristics is selected and performs well in such condition. 
1.2.9 BL (maximum capacity type) ball bearings
The boundary dimensions of the maximum capacity ball 
bearings are the same as those of series 62 and 63 of deep 


slots are provided on both inner and outer rings of the bearings. 
Accordingly, more steel balls are assembled in these bearings 
than those of the standard type deep groove ball bearings. 
Therefore, the load carrying capacity becomes 20% to 35%

bearings are not suitable for applications that employ heavy 
axial loads.
1.2.10 Angular contact ball bearings
In mechanical design, subject to both radial and 
axial loads, the so-called angular contact bearings are 
recommended. According to various load ratio of axial to radial 
load, these bearings with appropriate contact angle may be 
applied. They are usually applied in duplex arrangement to gain

axial rigidity. In high speed spindle application, angular contact 
ball bearings need to be adjusted with higher dimensional and 
running accuracy,  precision cage, and used in an appropriate 
way of lubrication to reach their maximum speed.  
Other types of angular contact ball bearings include thrust 
angular contact bearings and double row angular contact ball 
bearings. Thrust angular contact bearings with a larger contact 
angle of 60° boast greater axial rigidity. Besides, since balls are 
used as the rolling elements, the starting torque of an angular 
contact thrust ball bearing is less than that of a roller bearing.
The structure of double row angular contact ball bearing 
is designed by arranging two single row angular contact 
bearings back-to-back in duplex (DB) to form in one bearing 
with a contact angle of 30°. These bearings are capable of 
accommodating radial loads, axial loads in either direction, and 
have a high capacity for momentary loads as well.
1.2.11 Stainless ball bearings
Stainless ball bearings have the same boundary 
dimensions and ISO tolerance as standard deep groove ball 
bearings, but have better corrosive resistance than standard 
bearings in special environments.
The rings and balls of these bearings are made of 
martensite stainless steel with hardness at least HRc 58 , while 
cages and shields are made of austenite stainless steel, please 
refer to 8. Bearing Material for their chemical composition.
1.3 Cylindrical roller bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings have a larger load carrying 
capacity which makes them more suitable for applications 
requiring long life and endurance for heavy loads and shock 
loads.
Cylindrical roller bearings can be categorized into 
cylindrical roller bearings and needle roller bearings, according 
to its roller dimension ratio: ratio of roller length to its diameter. 
1.3.1 Needle Roller bearings
Needle roller bearings have relatively smaller diameter 
cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger that 
their diameter.
Compared with other types of rolling bearings, needle 
roller bearings have a small cross-sectional height and 
significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their 
volume. Also, because the inertial force action on them is 
limited, they are ideal choice for oscillating motion. Needle roller 
bearings contribute to compact light weight machine designs. 
They serve also as a ready replacement for sliding bearings.
TPI offers two types of needle roller bearings commonly 
used in motorcycle industry: needle roller and cage assembly 
and drawn-cup needle roller bearing.Needle roller and cage 
assembly is the most commonly used needle roller bearings. It 
comprises needle rollers and a cage to support the rollers. It is 
used typically for connecting rods in reciprocating compressors 
and small- and mid-sized internal combustion engines such 
as those for motorcycles. This assembly features such a cage 
that is specifically optimized for severe operating conditions 
involving high impact loads, complicated motions, high speed 
revolution and/or high operating temperatures.
The drawn-cup needle roller bearing is composed of an 
outer ring drawn from special thin steel plate by precision deep 
drawing, needle rollers, and a cage assembled in the outer ring 
after the hardened raceway surface. This bearing is the type 
with the lowest section height, of the rolling bearings with outer 
ring, and best-suited for space-saving design.

2. Bearing Number Codes
Rolling bearing part numbers indicate bearing type, 
dimensions, tolerances, internal construction, and other related 
specifications. Bearing numbers are comprised of a “basic 
number” followed by “supplementary codes.” The makeup 
and order of bearing numbers is shown in Table 2.1(Number 
and code arrangement for deep groove and miniature ball 
bearings), and Table 2.6(for needle roller bearings).
The basic number indicates general information about a 
bearing, such as its fundamental type, boundary dimensions, 
series number and bore diameter code. These coded series 
are shown in Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 respectively. 
The supplementary codes derive from prefixes and 
suffixes which indicate a bearing’s tolerances, internal 
clearances, and related specifications. These two codes are 
shown in Table 2.2 and Table 2.5.

3. Bearing Tolerances
Bearing “tolerances” or dimensional accuracy and running 
accuracy, are regulated by ISO and JIS B 1514 standards 
(rolling bearing tolerances). For dimensional accuracy, these 
standards prescribe the tolerances necessary when installing 

					V	


as the allowable limits for bearing runout during operation.
Dimensional accuracy constitutes the acceptable values 
for bore diameter, outer diameter, assembled bearing width, 
and bore diameter uniformity as seen in chamfer dimensions. 
Running accuracy constitutes the acceptable values for inner 
and outer ring radial runout and axial runout, inner ring side 
runout, and outer ring outer diameter runout. 
Allowable rolling bearing tolerances have been 
established according to precision classes. JIS Class 0 
corresponds to normal precision class bearings, and precision 
becomes progressively higher as the class number becomes 
smaller. Table 3.1 shows a relative comparison between JIS B 
1514 precision class standards and other standards.

4. Load Rating and Life
4.1 Bearing life
When in service, even a bearing that is properly 
lubricated, properly installed, and adequately protected from 
abrasives, moisture, and corrosive reagents, can fail from 
material fatigue. Material fatigue is manifested as flaking off 
of metallic particles from the surface of a raceway or rolling


	


	
The effective life of a bearing is usually defined in terms of 
the total number of revolutions a bearing can undergo before 
flaking of either the raceway surface or the rolling element 
surfaces occurs.
Other causes of bearing failure are often attributed to 
problems such as seizing, abrasions, cracking, chipping, 
gnawing, rust, etc. However, these so called “causes” of 
bearing failure are usually themselves caused by improper 
installation, insufficient or improper lubrication, faulty sealing 
or inaccurate bearing selection. Since the above mentioned 
“causes” of bearing failure can be avoided by taking the proper 
precautions, and are not simply caused by material fatigue,

4.2 Basic rating life and basic dynamic load rating
A group of seemingly identical bearings when subjected 
to identical load and operating conditions will exhibit a wide 
diversity in their durability. This “life” disparity can be accounted 
for by the difference in the fatigue of the bearing material 
itself. This disparity is considered statistically when calculating

basic rating life is based on a 90% statistical model which 
is expressed as the total number of revolutions 90% of the 
bearings in an identical group of bearings subjected to identical 
operating conditions will attain or surpass before flaking due 
to material fatigue. For bearings operating at fixed constant 
speeds, the basic rating life (90% reliability) is expressed in the 
total number of hours in operation.
The basic dynamic load rating is an expression of the 
load capacity of a bearing based on a constant load which the 
bearing can sustain for one million revolutions (the basic life 
rating). For radial bearings this rating applies to pure radial 
loads, and for thrust bearings it refers to pure axial loads. The 
basic dynamic load ratings given in the bearing tables of this 
catalog are for bearings constructed of TPI standard bearing 
materials, using standard manufacturing techniques. Please 
consult TPI for basic load ratings of bearings constructed of 
special materials or using special manufacturing techniques.
The relationship between the basic rating life, the basic 
dynamic load rating and the bearing load is given in formula 
(4-1).

4.3 Machine applications and requisite life
When selecting a bearing, it is essential that the 
requisite life of the bearing be established in relation to the 
operating conditions. The requisite life of the bearing is usually 
determined by the type of machine in which the bearing will 
be used, and duration of service and operational reliability 
requirements.
A general guide to these requisite life criteria is shown in 
Table 4.1. When determining bearing size, the fatigue life of the 
bearing is an important factor; however, besides bearing life, 
the strength and rigidity of the shaft and housing must also be 
taken into consideration.
4.4 Equivalent load
(1) Dynamic equivalent load
When both dynamic radial loads and dynamic axial loads 
act on a bearing at the same time, the hypothetical load acting 
on the center of the bearing which gives the bearings the same 
life as if they had only a radial load or only an axial load is 
called the dynamic equivalent load. For radial bearings, this 
load is expressed as pure radial load and is called the dynamic 
equivalent radial load.
The dynamic equivalent radial load is expressed by 
formula (4-6).
Pr = X Fr+ Y Fa  ........................................(4-6)
where,

Pr : Dynamic equivalent radial load, N or kgf

Fr : Actual radial load, N or kgf

Fa : Actual axial load, N or kgf

X  : Radial load factor

Y   : Axial load factor
The values for X and Y are listed in the bearing tables.
Generally speaking, it is considered that bearings are 
under the light load condition if the magnitude of equivalent 
radial load ≦ 0.06 Cr. Normal and heavy load conditions are

(2) Static equivalent load
The static equivalent load is a hypothetical load which 
would cause the same total permanent deformation at the most 
heavily stressed contact point between the rolling elements and 
the raceway under the actual load conditions where both static 
radial load and static axial load are simultaneously applied to 
a bearing. For a radial bearing, this hypothetical load refers to 
pure radial load. 
For radial bearings the static equivalent radial load can 
be found by using formula (4-7) or (4-8). The greater of the two 
resultant values is always taken for Por.
Por = Xo Fr+ Yo Fa  .....................................(4-7)
Por = Fr  .....................................................(4-8)
where,

Por : Static equivalent radial load, N or kgf

Fr : Actual radial load, N or kgf

Fa : Actual axial load , N or kgf

Xo : Static radial load factor

Yo : Static axial load factor 
The values for Xo and Yo are given in the respective 
bearing tables.
4.5 Bearing load distribution
For shafting, the static tension is considered to be 
supported by the bearings, and any loads acting on the shafts 
are distributed to the bearings. 
For example, in the gear shaft assembly depicted in Fig. 
4.2, the applied bearing loads can be found by using formulas 
(4-9) and (4-10).

FrA =   a+b  FI  +     d
       FII  ...........................(4-9)

          b             c+d

FrB =     a      FI  +     c
        FII  ...........................(4-10)

          b             c+d
where,

FrA : Radial load on bearing A, N or kgf  

FrB : Radial load on bearing B, N or kgf

FI , FII : Radial load on shaft, N or kgf
Fig. 4.2 Gear Shaft
[Example 1] What is the rating life in hours of operation (L10h ) 
for deep groove ball bearing 6207 operating at 650 r/min, with 
a radial load of 2.8 kN or 286 kgf ?
[Solution 1] From formula (4-6) the dynamic equivalent radial 
load:
Pr = Fr = 2.8 kN or 286 kgf
The basic dynamic rated load for bearing 6207 (from 
bearing table) is 25.7 kN or 2620 kgf, and the speed factor (fh) 
for ball bearings at 650 r/min (n) from Fig. 4.1 is 0.37. The life 
factor, fh , from formula (4-3) is:

fh = fn
   Cr     = 0.37X  
 25.7 = 3.40 

         Pr                    2.8
Therefore, with fn =3.40 from Fig. 4.1 the rated life, L10h , is 
approximately 20,000 hours.
[Example 2] What is the life rating L10h for the same bearing 
and conditions as in Example 1, but with an additional axial 
load Fa of 1.6 kN or 163 kgf?
[Solution 2] 

for Pr , the radial load factor X and axial load factor Y are used. 
The basic static load rating, Cor, for bearing 6207 is 15.3 kN or 
1560 kgf.

Fa / Cor =1.6 / 15.3 = 0.10

e = 0.29

For the operating radial load and axial load:

Fa / Fr =1.6 / 2.8 = 0.57 > e = 0.29

From the bearing tables X=0.56 and Y=1.48, and from 
formula (4-6) the equivalent radial load, Pr , is:
Bearing A
Bearing B

---

12

Pr = XFr +YFa = 0.56X2.8+1.48X1.6 

= 3.94 kN or 420kgf
From Fig. 4-1 and formula (4-3) the life factor, fh , is:

fh = fn
   Cr     = 0.37X  
 25.7 = 2.41 

         Pr                   3.94
Therefore, with life factor fh =2.41, from Fig. 4.1 the rated 
life, L10h , is approximately 7,000 hours.

5.1 Fit selection
Selection of the proper fit is generally based on the 
bearing rotation and load conditions. Generally-used, standard 
fits for most types of bearings and operating conditions can 
be obtained in bearing technical manuals. In combine with the 
following recommendations: 
(1)  The interference should be tighter for heavy bearings load.
(2) The interference should be tighter for vibration and shock 
load conditions.
(3) In general, the larger of the bearing size the tighter of the 
interference.

6. Bearing Internal Clearance and Preload
6.1 Bearing internal clearance
Bearing internal clearance (initial clearance) is the amount 
of internal clearance a bearing has before being installed on a 
shaft or in a housing.
As shown in Fig. 6.1, when either the inner ring or 
the outer ring is fixed and the other ring is free to move, 
displacement can take place in either an axial or radial 
direction. This amount of displacement (radially or axially) is 
termed the internal clearance and, depending on the direction, 
is called the radial internal clearance or the axial internal 
clearance.
The internal clearance values for deep groove ball 
bearings are shown in Table 6.1. The radial internal clearance 
of bearings for electric motor is given in Table 6.2.

6.2 Internal clearance selection
The internal clearance of a bearing under operating 
conditions (effective clearance) is usually smaller than the 
same bearing’s initial clearance before being installed and


difference in temperature between the inner and outer rings, 
etc. As a bearing’s operating clearance has an effect on bearing 
life, heat generation, vibration, noise, etc.; care must be taken 
in selecting the most suitable operating clearance.
6.3 Preload
Giving preload to a bearing results in the rolling 
element and raceway surfaces being under constant elastic 
compressive forces at their contact points. This has the effect 
of making the bearing extremely rigid so that even when load is 
applied to the bearing, radial or axial shaft displacement does 
not occur. Thus, the natural frequency of the shaft is increased, 
which is suitable for high speeds.
Preload is also used to prevent or suppress shaft runout, 
vibration, and noise; improve running accuracy and locating 
accuracy; reduce smearing, and regulate rolling element 
rotation.
The most common method of preloading is to apply 
an axial load illustrated in Fig. 6.2. This preloading method 
is divided into fixed position preload and constant pressure 
preload. In the electric motor applications, preloading is 
accomplished by using coil or Belleville springs. Recommended 
preloads are as follows:
For deep groove ball bearings:  
4~8 d  N 
or 
0.4~0.8 d  kgf
d : shaft diameter  mm
Axial clearance=δ1+δ2
 Radial clearance =δ

7. Lubrication
7.1 Lubrication of rolling bearings
The purpose of bearing lubrication is to prevent direct 
metal to metal contact between the various rolling and sliding 
elements. This is accomplished through the formation of a thin

dust. In order to achieve the above advantages and prolong the 
bearing life, the most effective lubrication method and lubricant

7.2 Grease lubrication
Grease type lubricants are relatively easy to handle and 
require only the simplest sealing devices, for these reasons, 
grease is the most widely used lubricant for rolling bearings. 
Lubricating grease are composed of either a mineral oil base 
or a synthetic oil base. To this base a thickener and other 
additives are added. Thickening agents are compounded with 
base oils to maintain the semi-solid state of the grease. Various 
additives are added to greases to improve various properties 
and efficiency. The properties of all greases are mainly 
determined by the kind of base oil used and by the combination 
of thickening agent and various additives.
Thickening agents is critical to grease performance., 
particularly with respect to temperature capability, water-
resistance, and oil-bleeding characteristics. They are divided 
into two broad classes: metallic soaps and non-soaps. Metallic 
soap thickeners include: lithium, sodium, calcium, etc. Common 
greases type, property and their characteristics are listed in 
Table 7.1. As performance characteristics of even the same 
type of grease will vary widely from brand to brand, it is best to 
check the manufacturers’ data when selecting a grease.
For some light load applications, such as the application 
of fan motors in air conditioning, the grease life becomes 
of prime bearing design parameter. If a pre-lubricated 
bearing is properly installed, keep free of abrasive, moisture, 
corrosive reagents, and dirt. The prediction of grease life can 
be calculated according to the method of Kawamura et al. 
The calculated life L50 (50% reliability life) of grease can be 
expressed as follows:
For urea-soap based grease :
logL =8.50-2.02 X 10
-6 X K X V
-2.95 X 10

7.3 Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication is suitable for applications requiring that 
bearing-generated heat or heat applied to the bearing from 
other sources be carried away from the bearing and dissipated 
to the outside.
Under normal operating conditions, spindle oil, machine 
oil, turbine oil, and other mineral oils are widely used for the 
lubrication of rolling bearings. However, for temperatures above


and damage will occur to the load carrying surfaces of the 
bearing. If viscosity is too high, viscous resistance will also be 
great and result in temperature increase and friction loss.
7.4 Bearing seals
Bearing seals have two main functions: to prevent 
lubricating oil from leaking out, and to prevent dust, water, and 
other contaminants from entering the bearing. Bearings have 
to be adequately lubricated to prevent direct metallic contact 
between the rolling elements, raceways and cages. In addition, 
it can prevent wear and protect the bearing surfaces against 
corrosion.

used. Grease has the advantage over oil; it is more easily 
retained in the bearing arrangement. These bearings have the 
following advantages:  
(1)  Lubricated for life and maintenance-free
(2)  Suited for normal and light load, moderate and low speed  
(3)  Low production cost 
(4)  No need of relubrication of greasing
According to the above advantages and their simplicity 
of housing and seal design, these bearings are widely used 
in electric appliance and electric motor industries. Table 7.3 
lists few types of shielded and sealed bearings and their 
construction and characteristics.

8. Bearing Materials
8.1 Raceway and rolling element materials
While the contact surfaces of a bearing’s raceways and 
rolling elements are subjected to repeated heavy stress, they 
still must maintain high precision and rotational accuracy. To 
accomplish this, the raceways and rolling elements must be 
made of a material that has high hardness, is resistant to rolling 
fatigue, wear and has good dimensional stability. The most 
common cause of fatigue cracking in bearings is the inclusion 
of non-metallic impurities in the steel. By using pure materials 
low in these non-metallic impurities, the rolling fatigue life 
of the bearing is lengthened. In general, steel varieties can 
be hardened not just on the surface but also can be deeply 
hardened by the so called “through hardening method”. It is 
used for the raceways and rolling elements of bearings. The 
hardness of the rings and rolling elements is usually on the 
order of HRc 58 to HRc 65. The most widely used and most 
adaptable materials for rolling bearings are high carbon steels. 
The most commonly used of the steels, SUJ2, is equivalent to 
such steels as AISI 52100 (U.S.A.), DIN 100 Cr6 (Germany), 
and GS 534A 99(U.K.). For bearings with large cross section 
dimensions, SUJ3 having good hardening prosperities are 
used. The chemical composition for SUJ2 and SUJ3 is shown 
in Table 8.1. For possible corrosive environment, the bearings 
made of SUS440C is recommended for such environment, also 
shown in Table 8.1
8.2 Cage materials
Bearing cage materials must have the strength to 
withstand rotational vibrations and shock loads. These materials

able to withstand bearing operation temperatures.
For small and medium sized bearings, pressed cages 
of cold or hot rolled steel with a low carbon content of approx. 
0.1% are used. However, depending on the application, 
austenitic stainless steel is also used.
For those conditions where fluctuating load and high 
temperature are applied, some pressed cages are soft nitrided 
to enhance their shock resistance. Materials for press cage are 
listed in Table 8.2.
Injection molded plastic cages are now widely used: most

9. Bearing Handling
Bearings are precision part. In order to preserve their 
accuracy and reliability, care must be exercised in their 
handling. In particular, bearing cleanliness must be maintained, 
sharp impacts avoided, and rust prevented.
9.1 Bearing storage
Most rolling bearings are coated with a rust preventative 
before being packed and shipped. If the package remains 
intact, bearings can be stored for many years. Observe the 
following precautions:
(1)  Bearings should be stored at room temperature with a 
relatively humidity of less than 60%.
(2)  If bearings come packed in a wooden box, take them out of 
the wooden box immediately, and store them on a shelf, at 
least 20 cm off the ground. (Shown in Fig. 9.1)
(3)  Do not stack bearings because the protective anti-rust 
compound may be squeezed out of bottom bearings. 
9.2 Installation
When bearings are being installed on shafts or in 
housings, the bearing rings should never be struck directly 
with a hammer or a drift, because it may damage the bearing. 
Any force applied to the bearing should always be evenly

both rings simultaneously, applying pressure to one ring should 
be avoided because indentations in the raceway surface may, 
or other internal damage may result.
Bearings should be fitted in a clean and dry work area. 
Especially for small and miniature bearings, a “clean room” 
should be provided, as any dust in the bearing will greatly affect

bearing also should be checked. Some other details for bearing 
installation are stated as follows:
(1) Shaft and housing bore surfaces
Before installation, shaft, housings and related parts 
should be cleaned and any burrs or cutting chips removed if 
necessary. Several steps for installation preparation as shown 
in Fig. 9.2
Fig 9.1 Storage of bearings
(2) Mounting tools
It is important that the correct method of mounting is 
selected and the suitable tools are used. All mounting tools 
should be cleaned and any burrs or cutting chips removed if 
necessary.
(3) Bearings
Open the bearing packaging just prior to use. As high 
precision components, rolling bearings are made and monitored 
under clean manufacturing environment before packaging. 
Most bearings may be mounted without washing or removing 
the rust preventive, unless special care procedures are stated.

Bearings with relatively small interference fits can be 
press fit at room temperature by using a sleeve against the 
inner ring face. Some proper installation and tools for bearings 
are shown in Fig. 9.3. Usually, bearings are installed by striking 
the sleeve with a hammer; however, when installing a large 
number of bearings, a mechanical or hydraulic press should be 
used. When installing non-separable bearings on a shaft and

Fig. 9.5 Proper heating methods and attentions
1. The most commonly used method of heating bearings is 
immersed them in the hot oil. The oil must clean and no 
impurities. However, to avoid overheating parts of bearings, 
they should never be brought in direct contact with the heating 
element or bottom of the oil tank.

(For bearings fully heating, we placed bearings on the wire grid 
or suspended inside the heating tank.)
2.  Fig.1 shows the relationship between the bearing inner ring 
bore diameter temperature differential and the amount of 
thermal expansion.
3. When heated bearings are installed on shafts, the inner ring 
must be held against the shaft abutment until the bearing has 
been cooled in order to prevent gaps from occurring between 
the ring and the abutment face.
Cautions:
1. In any event, bearings should never be heated above 120°C.
2. It’s not used for pre-lubricated shielded and sealed bearings.
Other heating methods:
1. Incubator: Used for fully dry bearings.
2. Induction Heating System : Used for fully dry and 
demagnetized bearings.
