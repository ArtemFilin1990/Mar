4.1	
Performance description
The axial piston variable pump generates, controls and regulates a hydraulic-fluid 
flow. It is designed for mobile applications such as construction machinery.
Refer to the data sheet and order confirmation for the technical data, operating 
conditions and operating limits of the axial piston unit.
4.2	
Device description
The A4VG is an axial piston variable pump with swashplate design for hydrostatic 
drives in closed circuits. Flow is proportional to drive speed and displacement. 
The flow can be steplessly changed by controlling the swashplate (11).
A hydraulic system is considered to be closed if the hydraulic fluid which flows 
back from the consumer is directed directly back to the pump. Here, there is 
a high-pressure side and a low-pressure side depending on the load direction 
(output torque on the consumer).

For axial piston units with swashplate design, the pistons (10) are arranged axially 
with respect to the drive shaft (1). They are guided in the rotating cylinder (9) and 
support themselves with the slipper pads (11) on the non-rotating swashplate 
(12). The drive shaft (1) and cylinder (9) are connected to one another by means 
of gearing.
Closed circuit


12/60	
Functional description
4.2.2	
Torque is applied to the drive shaft (1) by an engine. The cylinder (9) turns with 
the drive shaft, turning with it the pistons (10). On each rotation, the pistons 
perform a stroke movement which is defined by the pitch of the swashplate (12). 
The slipper pads (11) are held on and guided along the glide surface of the 
swashplate by the retaining plate (2). During a rotation, each piston moves over 
the bottom and top dead centers back to its initial position. During this action, the 
fluid volume defined by the piston surface and the stroke is fed in or removed 
through the two control slits in the control plate (5). On the low-pressure side, (6) 
fluid flows into the enlarging piston chamber – in a closed circuit this is supported 
by the return and boost pressures. At the same time, on the high-pressure 
side (8) the fluid is pushed out of the cylinder chamber into the hydraulic system 
by the pistons.
The operating pressure is limited by the pressure cut-off.
The pressure cut-off corresponds to a pressure regulator which reduces the pump 
capacity once the set specified pressure value is reached so that the set pressure 
is maintained but not exceeded.
The pressure spikes which occur during very rapid swiveling operations as well as 
the maximum pressure are safeguarded by the superordinate high-pressure relief 
valves. These valves open if the set value is exceeded, thereby depressurizing 
the low-pressure side. The fluid quantity remains constant in the closed circuit. 
The leakage at the pump and motor is replaced by the auxiliary pump (7).
The auxiliary pump continuously supplies a sufficient volume of fluid (boost 
volume) from a small tank to the low-pressure side of the closed circuit via a 
check valve to replenish the internal leakage of the variable pump and consumer.
The optional neutral valve interrupts the active control pressure and joins the two 
positioning chambers for pressure equalization. The springs in the positioning 
chambers move the stroke piston (3) towards the middle position (neutral 
position). The reset function is influenced by the current operating pressure and 
the speed.
Switching off the control pressure and a bypass function for the two positioning 
chambers does not ensure that the pump moves to the middle position (neutral 
position).
Use an appropriate emergency-off device to ensure that the drive can be brought 
to a safe position at any time. The device or system operator is responsible for the 
installation of a proper emergency-off device.
The following warning notice applies to all axial piston units with the HD and EP 
control units:
The spring return in the control unit is not a security device.
The slide valve of the control unit can be blocked in an undefined position by 
internal contamination (impure hydraulic fluid, abrasion or residual contamination 
from system components). As a result, the axial piston unit can no longer supply 
the flow specified by the operator.
Properly install an emergency-off function to ensure that the driven consumer 
can be brought to a safe position (e.g. immediate stop).
Maintain the specified cleanliness level 20/18/15 (< 90 °C) or 19/17/14 in 
accordance with ISO 4406.

The swivel angle of the swashplate (12) is infinitely variable. By changing the 
swivel angle, the piston stroke and, therefore, the displacement change. The 
swivel angle is controlled hydraulically via the stroke piston (3). The swashplate is 
mounted for easy motion in swivel bearings and the neutral position spring 
centered. Increasing the swivel angle increases the displacement; reducing the 
angle results in a corresponding reduction in displacement.
If the swashplate is not swiveled out, the displacement is equal to zero. Various 
controllers are available depending on requirements.
Additional information on the control devices, such as the circuit diagram or 
characteristics, can be found in technical data sheet RE 92003.
Control


14/60	
Control units
4.2.3	
The mounting surface for the control unit is machined and is sealed with the 
standard seal for control units and a cover plate. This version is ready for 
retrofitting to control units (HD, HW, EP, EZ). When used directly for "DA" control 
and in combinations with "DA" control, the appropriate adjustments must be made 
to the spring assembly of the control cylinder and control plate.
The stroke cylinder of the pump is directly supplied with control pressure by 
switching a pilot pressure on or off at ports X1 or X2. In this way, the swashplate 
and thus the displacement can be adjusted between Vg = 0 and Vg max. A different 
flow direction is associated with each port.
By energizing or de-energizing a control current to either switching solenoid a 
or b, the stroke cylinders of the pump are supplied with control pressure by the EZ 
control unit. In this way, the swashplate and thus the displacement is adjustable 
without intermediate settings between Vg = 0 and Vg max. A different flow direction 
is associated with each switching solenoid.

EZ – electric two-point control,

15/60
Depending on the pressure difference of the pilot pressure pSt in the two control 
lines (ports Y1 and Y2), the stroke cylinder of the pump is supplied with control 
pressure via the HD control unit. Thus, the swashplate – and, therefore, the 
displacement – are infinitely adjustable. A different flow direction is associated 
with each control line.

Depending on the drive speed, the DA control unit generates a pilot pressure which 
charges the stroke cylinder of the pump with control pressure via a 4/3-directional 
valve, allowing the swashplate – and, therefore, the displacement – to be infinitely 
adjusted. Each flow direction is assigned a switching solenoid on the 4/3-directional 
valve.

Bypass function
4.3	
For vehicles with hydrostatic travel drive, as long as there is no downstream 
mechanical interruption of the drive train (switch to idle/free running), the flow can 
be altered using a bypass function in order to tow the vehicle out of the immediate 
danger zone.
Turning the corresponding screw allows the hydraulic fluid to flow freely.
Bypass function, sizes 28 to 56
4.3.1	
The standard version of the A4VG variable pump, sizes 28–56, has no 
high-pressure relief valves with bypass function. If necessary, this must be 
specified when ordering.
Activating the bypass function, sizes 28 to 56 
Fig. 11: 
To activate the bypass function:
Switch off the combustion engine.
Loosen the lock nut (
2) by turning counter-clockwise one half rotation with a 
hex wrench (WAF 13).
Use an Allen key (WAF 4) to screw in the screw (
1) clockwise until the 
screw (1) is against the spring disc. This is apparent by the increased 
resistance. Then screw the screw (1) one half turn into the spring disc.
Tighten the lock nut (
4.	
2) clockwise with a torque of 22 Nm.
The maximum towing speed is dependent on the gear ratio in the vehicle and 
must be calculated by the vehicle manufacturer. The corresponding flow of  
Q = 30 l/min must not be exceeded.
The vehicle may only be towed out of the immediate danger zone.
Higher towing speeds and longer towing distances result in impermissible heat 
generation and insufficient lubrication. This damages the axial piston unit.
Only tow the vehicle out of the immediate danger zone.

An optimal seal is not ensured if the high-pressure relief valve is loosened.  
If hydraulic fluid leaks from the high-pressure relief valve, clear away the fluid 
immediately and clean the valve.
The maximum towing speed is dependent on the gear ratio in the vehicle and 
must be calculated by the vehicle manufacturer. The corresponding flow of  
Q = 100 l/min must not be exceeded.
The vehicle may only be towed out of the immediate danger zone.
Higher towing speeds and longer towing distances result in impermissible heat 
generation and insufficient lubrication. This damages the axial piston unit.
Only tow the vehicle out of the immediate danger zone.
During and after towing, the axial piston units are hot.
Wear protective clothing. 
To deactivate the bypass function:
Immediately following towing, switch off the bypass function.
Restore the function of the high-pressure relief valve. To do this, tighten the 
screw (1) with a hex wrench (WAF 36) by turning clockwise with a torque of 
200 ± 10 Nm.
While towing with the bypass function activated, the closed hydraulic circuit 
empties itself. This can result in unintended functions when restarting the travel 
drive.
Start the travel drive only after completely filling and air bleeding the hydraulic 
circuit (see "7.1 First commissioning").

Transporting with lifting device
5.1.1	
For transporting, the axial piston unit can be connected to a lifting device via a 
ring screw or a lifting strap.
The drive shaft can be used to transport the axial piston unit as long as only 
outward axial forces occur. Thus, you can suspend the axial piston unit from the 
drive shaft.
To do this, screw a ring screw completely into the thread on the drive shaft. 
The size of the thread is stated in the installation drawing.
Make sure that each ring screw can bear the total weight of the axial piston 
unit plus approx. 20 %.
You can hoist the axial piston unit as shown in Fig. 15 with the ring screw 
screwed into the drive shaft without any risk of damage.

Transport and storage
The warranty is rendered void if the requirements and storage conditions are 
not adhered to or after expiration of the maximum storage time (see Table 4).
Procedure after expiration of the maximum storage time:
Check the entire axial piston unit for damage and corrosion prior to 
installation.
Check the axial piston unit for proper function and leaks during a test run.
Replace the shaft seal ring if the storage time of 24 months is exceeded.
After expiration of the maximum storage time, we recommend that you have 
the axial piston unit inspected by your responsible Rexroth Service partner.
In the event of questions regarding spare parts, contact your responsible Rexroth 
Service partner or the service department of the manufacture's plant for the axial 
piston unit, see chapter "9.5 Spare parts" for further information.
If a dismounted axial piston unit is to be stored, it must be conserved against 
corrosion for the duration of the storage.
The following instructions only refer to axial piston units which are operated 
with a mineral-oil based hydraulic fluid. Other hydraulic fluids require 
conservation methods that are specifically designed for them. In such a case, 
consult with Rexroth Service (see chapter "9.5 Spare parts" for address).
Rexroth recommends the following procedure:
Clean the axial piston unit, see chapter "9.1 Cleaning and care" for further 
information.
Completely empty the axial piston unit.
For storage time up to 12 months: Moisten the inside of the axial piston unit 
with mineral oil and fill with approx. 100 ml mineral oil. 
For storage time up to 24 months: Fill the axial piston unit with corrosion 
protection VCI 329 (20 ml). 
Fill via case drain port T1 or T2, see chapter "6.4 Assembling the axial piston 
unit", Fig. 22 to 25.
Seal all ports airproof.

After disassembly


27/60
6	 Assembly
Prior to assembly, the following documents must be available:
Installation drawing for the axial piston unit (available from Rexroth),
Hydraulic circuit diagram for the axial piston unit (in the installation drawing),
Hydraulic circuit diagram for the system (available from the system 
manufacturer),
Order confirmation (contains the preset data of the axial piston unit),
Data sheet for the axial piston unit (contains the technical data).
6.1	
Unpacking
The axial piston unit is delivered in a corrosion protection film made of 
polyethylene material.
Dispose of the packaging according to the national regulations of your country.
Risk of parts falling out!
If the packaging is not opened correctly, parts may fall out and damage the parts 
or even result in injury.
Place the packaging on a flat and solid surface.
Only open the packaging from the top.
6.2	
Installation conditions
The installation location and position of the axial piston unit essentially 
determine the procedures during installation and commissioning (such as when 
filling the axial piston unit).
Note that you can expect certain installation positions to affect the control 
device. Because of gravity, dead weight and case pressure, minor characteristic 
displacements and actuating time changes may occur.
Adhere to all limits specified in the data sheet regarding temperature, 
viscosity, cleanliness of the hydraulic fluid.
Make certain that the case of the axial piston unit is filled with hydraulic fluid 
during commissioning and operation. This is also to be observed following 
relatively long standstill periods as the axial piston unit may empty via the 
hydraulic lines.
The case drain fluid in the case interior must be directed to the tank via the 
highest case drain port. Use the line size which is appropriate for the port.
Avoid using a check valve in the case drain line (exception: see "Above-tank 
installation" in chapter "6.3 Installation position").
To achieve favorable noise values, decouple all connecting lines from all 
vibration-capable components (e.g. tank) using elastic elements.
CAUTION!


28/60	
Make certain that the suction line, case drain line, and return line flow into the 
tank below the minimum fluid level in all operational states.

Make certain that a minimum suction pressure of 0.8 bar absolute is present 
at port "S" during operation and on cold starts in all installation positions and 
installation locations for the axial piston pump, see Fig. 17. See data sheet for 
additional values.
Absolute cleanliness is required. The axial piston unit must be installed in a 
clean condition. Contamination of the hydraulic fluid can have a considerable 
impact on the service life of the axial piston unit.
Do not use any cotton waste or linty cloths for cleaning.
Use suitable liquid detergents to remove lubricants and other difficult-tof
remove contamination. Detergents must not penetrate the hydraulic system.
Risk of damage by air inclusions!
An air pocket in the area near the bearings will damage the axial piston unit.
Make certain that the case is completely filled with hydraulic fluid during 
commissioning and during operation with the "drive shaft upward" installation 
position.
During commissioning and during operation, the suction line must be filled 
with hydraulic fluid.
Risk of damage by hydraulic fluid loss!
With above-tank installation, the case interior may drain via the case drain line 
after longer standstill periods (air enters via the shaft seal ring) or via the service 
line (gap leakage). The bearings are thus insufficiently lubricated when the pump 
is restarted.
Check the hydraulic fluid level in the case interior regularly; if necessary, 
recommission.

Installation position
The following installation positions are permissible. The shown piping layout 
illustrates the basic layout.
"Shaft upward" installation position (positions 4 and 8): 
For the "shaft upward" installation position, you will also need the additional R1 
air bleed port in the flange area for sizes 71-180. This port is not included in 
the standard version and must be specified in plain text when ordering.

6.3.2	 Above-tank installation
Above-tank installation is when the axial piston unit is installed above the 
minimum fluid level of the tank.
Risk of damage to the product!
An air pocket in the area near the bearings will damage the axial piston unit.
Make certain that the pump case is completely filled with hydraulic fluid during 
commissioning and during operation with the "drive shaft upward" installation 
position.
Check the hydraulic fluid level in the case interior regularly; if necessary, 
recommission. With above-tank installation, the case interior may drain via 
the case drain line after longer standstill periods (air enters via the shaft seal 
ring) or via the service line (gap leakage). The bearings are thus insufficiently 
lubricated when the pump is restarted.
Make certain that the suction line is always filled with hydraulic fluid during 
commissioning and operation.


32/60	
Observe the maximum permissible suction height hSmax = 800 mm.
Recommendation for installation position 8 (drive shaft upward): A check valve 
in the case drain line (opening pressure 0.5 bar) can prevent draining of the 
case interior.

Assembling the 
6.4	
axial piston unit
Systems which are in operation pose a risk of injury!
Working on operating systems poses a danger to life and limb. The work steps 
described in this chapter must only be performed on systems which are at a 
standstill. Before beginning work:
Ensure that the engine cannot be switched on.
Ensure that all power-transmitting components and connections (electric, 
pneumatic, hydraulic) are switched off according to the manufacturer's 
instructions and are secured against being switched on again. If possible, 
remove the main fuse for the system.
Ensure that the system is completely hydraulically relieved and depressurized. 
Please follow the system manufacturer's instructions.
Only qualified personnel (see chapter "2.3 Personnel qualifications" on 
page 6) are authorized to assemble the axial piston unit.
6.4.1	 Preparation
Check the delivery contents for completeness and transport damages.
Compare the material number and designation (ordering code) with the details 
in the order confirmation.
If the material number for the axial piston unit does not correspond to the one 
in the order confirmation, contact Rexroth Service for clarification, see chapter 
"9.5 Spare parts" for address.
Before assembling, completely empty the axial piston unit to prevent mixing 
with the hydraulic fluid used in the system.
Check the direction of rotation of the axial piston unit (on the name plate) and 
4.	
make sure that this corresponds to the direction of rotation of the engine.
L
Fig. 20: Direction of rotation
L
Counter-clockwise
Clockwise
The direction of rotation as specified on the name plate determines the 
direction of rotation of the axial piston unit as viewed on the drive shaft.  
For information on the direction of rotation of the engine, please refer to the 
engine manufacturer's operating instructions.
Danger!


34/60	
6.4.2	 Dimensions
The installation drawing contains the dimensions for all ports on the axial piston 
unit. Also observe the instructions provided by the manufacturers of the other 
components when selecting the required tools.
6.4.3	 General instructions
During assembly and disassembly of the axial piston unit, observe the following 
general instructions and handling instructions:
After a short operating time, toothed belts lose a major portion of their pre-
tension and thus cause speed variations and torsional vibrations. 
Torsional vibrations may cause leakages on the shaft seal ring or increased 
rotary angle accelerations of the rotary group of the driven axial piston unit. 
Particularly at risk are diesel drives with a small number of cylinders and low 
flywheel mass.
V-belt drives without automatic tensioning device are also critical with regard to 
speed variations and torsional vibrations. These can also lead to leakages on 
the shaft seal ring. 
An automatic tensioning device can lessen the speed variations and vibrations 
and thus avoid consequential damage.
When driving an axial piston unit with the aid of a cardan shaft, vibrations may 
occur which result in leakages on the shaft seal ring of the axial piston unit 
depending on the temperature and frequency.
When driving with toothed belts or v-belts, always use an automatic tensioning 
device.
Fix the axial piston unit so that the expected forces and torques can be 
transferred without any danger.
The permissible axial and radial loading of the drive shaft, the permissible 
torsional vibrations, the optimum direction of load force, as well as the limit 
speeds can be found in the data sheet.
Observe the permissible radial forces on the drive shaft when driving with 
radial loading (belt drives). If necessary, the belt disc must be separately 
mounted.
Hitting or impulsive forces on the drive shaft can damage the axial piston unit.
Do not hit the coupling or drive shaft of the axial piston unit.
Do not set/place the axial piston unit on the drive shaft.
Details on the permissible axial and radial forces can be found in the data 
sheet.
How to assemble the axial piston unit depends on the connecting elements  
to the drive side. The following descriptions explain the installation of the axial 
piston unit:
with a coupling
on a gearbox 
WARNING!


35/60
6.4.4	 Installation with coupling
How to assemble the axial piston unit with a coupling is described in detail in the 
following:
Assemble the specified coupling half onto the drive shaft of the axial piston 
unit according to the instructions of the coupling manufacturer.
The drive shaft end of the axial piston unit is provided with a threaded bore. 
Use this threaded bore to pull the coupling element onto the drive shaft. Refer 
to the installation drawing for the dimensions of the threaded bore.
Make sure that the installation location is clean and free from dirt and 
contaminants.
Clamp the coupling hub onto the drive shaft or ensure permanent lubrication 
of the drive shaft. This prevents the formation of frictional corrosion and the 
associated wear.
Transport the axial piston unit to the installation location.
4.	
Assemble the coupling onto the drive according to the instructions of the 
5.	
coupling manufacturer.
The axial piston unit must not be tightened down until the coupling has been 
correctly assembled.
Fix the axial piston unit at the installation location.
6.	
If necessary, details on the required tools and tightening torques for the fixing 
7.	
screws are available from the machine or system manufacturer.
For bell housing installation, check the coupling axial play through the bell 
window according to the manufacturer's instructions.
For flange installation, align the support for the axial piston unit with the 
drive.
When using flexible couplings, check that the drive is free of resonance after 
8.	
completing the installation.
6.4.5	 Installation on a gearbox
How to assemble the axial piston unit on a gearbox is described in detail in the 
following:
After installing on a gearbox, the axial piston unit is covered and is difficult to 
access:
Therefore, before installing, make sure that the centering diameter centers the 
axial piston unit (observe tolerances) and that no impermissible axial or radial 
forces act on the drive shaft of the axial piston unit (installation length).
Protect the plug connections of the drive shaft from frictional corrosion by 
providing permanent lubrication.


36/60	
Completing
6.4.6	
 assembly
Remove any mounted transport screws.
Remove the transport protection. 
The axial piston unit was delivered with protective covers and plastic plugs or 
locking screws. These must be removed before connecting. Use appropriate 
tools.
Make certain that the sealing and functional surfaces are not damaged.
Ports which are intended for connecting lines are provided with plastic plugs 
or locking screws, which serve as transport protection. If no connection is 
made, these ports must be plugged with a suitable metal locking screw since 
the plastic plugs are not pressure-proof.
Risk of personal injury or damage to equipment!
Operating the axial piston unit with plastic plugs can result in injuries or damage 
to the axial piston unit.
Before commissioning, remove all plastic plugs and replace them with 
suitable, pressure-proof, metal locking screws.

37/60
The adjusting screws are protected against unauthorized resetting by means 
of protective caps. Removal of the protective caps will void the warranty. If you 
need a modification of the setting, please contact your responsible Rexroth 
Service (address as to chapter "9.5 Spare parts").
For versions with through drive, assemble the auxiliary pump according to the 
4.	
pump manufacturer's instructions.
Hydraulically connecting 
6.4.7	
the axial piston unit
The machine or system manufacturer is responsible for dimensioning the lines. 
The axial piston unit must be connected to the rest of the hydraulic system 
in accordance with the hydraulic circuit diagram of the machine or system 
manufacturer.
Damage to the axial piston unit!
When assembling hydraulic lines and hoses under mechanical stress, they are 
exposed to additional mechanical forces during operation which reduce the 
service life of the axial piston unit and the entire machine or system.
Assemble hydraulic lines and hoses without mechanical stress.
Generally, a minimum permissible suction pressure at port "S" is specified for 
axial piston pumps in all installation positions. If the pressure at port "S" drops 
below the specified values, damage may occur which may lead to destruction of 
the axial piston pump.
Make certain that the necessary suction pressure is achieved.  
This is influenced by:
appropriate piping of the suction cross-section 
appropriate pipe diameters
appropriate position of the tank
appropriate viscosity of the hydraulic fluid
filter cartridge in the suction line (regularly check the level of soiling  
of the filter cartridge)
Only connect hydraulic lines to the service and function ports.
Wear and malfunctions!
The cleanliness of the hydraulic fluid has a considerable impact on the cleanliness 
and service life of the hydraulic system. Any contamination of the hydraulic fluid 
leads to wear and malfunctions. In particular, contaminants like e.g. welding 
beads or metal cuttings in the hydraulic lines may damage the axial piston unit.
Absolute cleanliness is required.
The axial piston unit must be installed in a clean condition.
Make sure that all ports, hydraulic lines and add-on units (e.g. testers) are 
clean.
Make sure that no contaminants may penetrate when sealing the ports.
Take care that no detergents enter the hydraulic system.
 Do not use any cotton waste or linty cloths for cleaning.
Do not use hemp as sealant under any circumstances.
CAUTION!


38/60	
Observe the following notes when routing the suction, pressure and case drain 
lines.
Make certain that the suction line (pipe or hose) is as short and straight as 
possible.
The line cross section of the suction line is to be measured so that the 
minimum permissible pressure at the suction port is not dropped below and 
the maximum permissible pressure is not exceeded.
Observe the air tightness of the junctions and the pressure resistance of the 
hose, also with respect to the external air pressure.
With the pressure lines, make certain that the pipes, hoses and connecting 
elements are approved for the operating pressure range.
Always route the case drain lines so that the housing is constantly filled 
with hydraulic fluid and to ensure that no air gets through the shaft seal ring 
even during extended standstill periods. The case internal pressure must not 
exceed the limit values listed for the axial piston unit in the data sheet under 
any operating conditions. The case drain line in the tank must end up below 
the minimum fluid level under all conditions (see chapter "6.3 Installation 
position").
The ports and fixing threads are designed for the operating pressures 
specified in the data sheet. The machine or system manufacturer must ensure 
that the connecting elements and lines correspond to the specified operating 
conditions (pressure, flow, hydraulic fluid, temperature) with the necessary 
safety factors.
To connect the axial piston unit to the hydraulic system:
Remove the locking screws at the ports at which the connections are to be 
made according to the hydraulic circuit diagram.
Use only clean hydraulic lines.
Connect the lines according to the hydraulic circuit diagram. 
Either pipes or hoses must be connected to all ports according to the 
installation drawing and machine or system circuit diagram or the ports 
plugged using suitable locking screws.
The installation drawing contains the dimensions for all connections and ports 
on the axial piston unit. Also observe the instructions provided by the 
manufacturers of the other hydraulic components when selecting the required 
tools.
Make sure
4.	
that the cap nuts are correctly tightened on the fittings and flanges (observe 
tightening torques!). Mark all checked fittings using e.g. a permanent 
marker.
that the pipes and hose lines and every combination of connecting piece, 
coupling or connecting point with hoses or pipes have been inspected by a 
technically qualified person for safe working condition.

The axial piston units are used in application areas with metric as well as with 
Imperial systems of units.
Both the system of units as well as the size of threaded hole and threaded plug  
(e.g. locking screw) must match.
Due to the lack of options for visually detecting differences, there is a risk of 
mix‑ups.
Risk of damage to persons and property!
If a threaded plug which is of a different measurement system and size with 
respect to the threaded hole is pressurized, the threaded plug may loosen itself or 
even be ejected from the hole in a projectile-like manner. 
This can result in serious injury and damage to equipment. Hydraulic fluid can be 
discharged from this leakage point.
Use the drawings (installation drawing/data sheet) to determine the required 
threaded plug for each fitting.
Make certain that there are no mix-ups when assembling armatures, fixing 
screws and locking screws.
For all threaded holes, use a threaded plug from the same system of units and 
of the correct size.
Electrical connection of 
6.4.8	
the axial piston unit
The machine or system manufacturer is responsible for the layout of the electric 
control.
For electrically controlled axial piston units, the electric control must be connected 
according to the circuit diagram of the system manufacturer.
Short circuit in event of penetrating hydraulic fluid!
Fluid can penetrate the product and cause a short circuit.
Do not install electrically controlled axial piston units in a tank below the tank 
fluid level (tank installation).
Switch off power supply to the relevant system component.
Electrically connect the axial piston unit (12 or 24 V).
If necessary, you can change the position of the plug by turning the solenoid.
To do this, proceed as follows:
Loosen the fixing nut (
1) of the solenoid. To do this, turn the fixing nut (1) one 
turn counter-clockwise.
Turn the solenoid body (
2) to the desired position.
Retighten the fixing nut. Tightening torque of the fixing nut: 5+1 Nm.
For further details and technical data, e.g. regarding the selection of a suitable 
mating connector, please refer to data sheet RE 92003.

Danger while working in the danger zone of a machine or system!
It is not permissible to work in the danger zone of a machine or system.
The machine or system must only be operated if safe working is ensured.
Pay attention to and rectify potential danger sources before operating the 
machine or system.
Nobody may stand in the danger zone of the machine or system.
The emergency stop button for the machine or system must be within the 
operator's reach.
Always follow the instructions of the machine or system manufacturer during 
commissioning.
Risk of damage to persons and property!
Commissioning of the axial piston unit requires basic mechanical and hydraulic 
knowledge.
Only qualified personnel (see chapter "2.3 Personnel qualifications" on 
page 6) are authorized to commission the axial piston unit.
Risk of toxication and injury!
Contact with hydraulic fluids may damage your health (e.g. eye injuries, skin 
damage, toxication upon inhalation).
Always check the lines for wear and damage before each commissioning.
While performing these checks, wear safety gloves, safety glasses and 
suitable working clothes.
If hydraulic fluid should, nevertheless, come into contact with your eyes or

7.1	
commissioning
Risk of damage to the product!
Any contamination of the hydraulic fluid leads to wear and malfunctions.  
In particular, contaminants like e.g. welding beads or metal cuttings in the 
hydraulic lines may damage the axial piston unit.
Ensure utmost cleanliness during commissioning.
Make sure that no contaminants may penetrate when sealing the gauge ports
.
Risk of damage to the product!
If you commission the axial piston unit without or with insufficient hydraulic fluid, 
the axial piston unit is damaged immediately or even destroyed.
When commissioning or recommissioning a machine or system, make sure 
that the case interior and the suction and service lines of the axial piston unit 
are filled with hydraulic fluid and remain filled during operation.
When commissioning the axial piston unit, observe the basic safety 
instructions and intended use provided in chapter "2 General safety 
instructions".
Filling the 
7.1.1	
axial piston unit
You will require an approved hydraulic fluid:
The machine or system manufacturer can provide you with precise details on the 
hydraulic fluid. Details on minimum requirements for mineral-oil based hydraulic 
fluids, environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids or HF hydraulic fluids for the 
axial piston unit are available in the Rexroth publications RE 90220, RE 90221 
and RE 90223, respectively.
To ensure the functional reliability of the axial piston unit, cleanliness level 
20/18/15 according to at least ISO 4406 is necessary for the hydraulic fluid.  
At very high hydraulic fluid temperatures (+90 °C to maximum +115 °C), 
cleanliness level 19/17/14 according to at least ISO 4406 is necessary.  
For permissible temperatures, see the data sheet.
Risk of damage to the product!
An air pocket in the area near the bearings will damage the axial piston unit.
Make certain that the pump case is completely filled with hydraulic fluid during 
commissioning and during operation with the "drive shaft upward" installation 
position.
Check the hydraulic fluid level in the case interior regularly; if necessary, 
recommission. With above-tank installation, the case interior may drain via 
the case drain line after longer standstill periods (air enters via the shaft seal 
ring) or via the service line (gap leakage). The bearings are thus insufficiently 
lubricated when the pump is restarted.
Make certain that the suction line is always filled with hydraulic fluid during 
commissioning and operation.
CAUTION!


45/60
Commissioning
The axial piston unit should be filled with a filling unit (10 µm filter grade).  
The axial piston unit must not be operated while it is being filled.
Danger of environmental contamination!
The discharge or spillage of hydraulic fluid while filling the axial piston unit can 
lead to environmental pollution and contamination of the groundwater.
When filling and changing the hydraulic fluid, always place a catch pan under 
the axial piston unit.
Observe the information in the safety data sheet for the hydraulic fluid and the 
specifications provided by the system manufacturer.
Fill and air bleed the axial piston unit via the appropriate ports, see chapter 
"6.3 Installation position". The hydraulic lines of the system must also be filled.
Test the direction of rotation of the engine. To do this, rotate the engine briefly 
at the lowest rotational speed (inching). Make sure that direction of rotation of 
the axial piston unit matches the details on the name plate, see also chapter 
"4.4 Product identification", Fig. 14: Name plate.
Operate the axial piston pump at a lower speed (starter speed for internal 
combustion engines or inching operation for electric motors) until the pump 
system is completely filled and bled. To inspect, drain the hydraulic fluid at the 
case drain port and wait until it drains without bubbles.
Make certain that all ports are either connected to pipes or plugged according 
4.	
to the general circuit diagram.
Testing the hydraulic fluid supply
7.1.2	
The axial piston unit must always have a sufficient supply of hydraulic fluid. 
For this reason, the supply of hydraulic fluid must be ensured at the start of the 
commissioning process.
When you test the hydraulic fluid supply, constantly monitor the noise 
development and check the hydraulic fluid level in the tank. If the axial piston unit 
becomes louder (cavitation) or the case drain fluid is discharged with bubbles, 
this is an indication that the axial piston unit is not being sufficiently supplied with 
hydraulic fluid.
Notes on troubleshooting can be found in chapter "14 Troubleshooting".
To test the hydraulic fluid supply:
Allow the engine to run at the slowest speed. The axial piston unit must be 
operated without load. Pay attention to leakage and noise.
Check the axial piston unit’s case drain line during the test. The case drain 
fluid should not contain any bubbles.
Check the suction pressure at port "S" of the axial piston pump. Refer to data 
sheet RE 92003 for the permissible value.
Check the case drain pressure at connected port "
4.	
T1" or "T2". Refer to data 
sheet RE 92003 for the permissible value.


46/60	
Commissioning
7.1.3	 Performing functional test
Risk of injury in case of incorrectly connected machine or system!
Any change of the connections will lead to malfunctions (e.g. lift instead of lower) 
and thus represents a corresponding danger to persons and equipment.
When connecting hydraulic components, observe the specified piping 
according to the hydraulic circuit diagram of the machine or system 
manufacturer.
Once you have tested the hydraulic fluid supply, you must perform a functional 
test on the machine or system. The functional test should be performed according 
to the instructions of the machine or system manufacturer.
The axial piston unit is checked for functional capability before delivery according 
to the technical data. During commissioning, it must be ensured that the axial 
piston unit was installed in accordance with the design of the machine or system.
7.1.4	 Performing flushing cycle
In order to remove foreign bodies from the system, Rexroth recommends a 
flushing cycle for the entire system.
During the flushing cycle, the axial piston unit must be operated without load. 
The flushing cycle can be performed, e.g. by using an additional flushing unit. 
Follow the instructions of the flushing unit's manufacturer for the exact 
procedure during the flushing cycle.
7.2	
Recommissioning after downtime
Depending on the installation conditions and ambient conditions, changes may 
occur in the system which make recommissioning necessary.
Among others, the following criteria may make recommissioning necessary:
Air in the hydraulic system
Water in the hydraulic system
Old hydraulic fluid
Other contamination
Before recommissioning, proceed as described in chapter  
"7.1 First commissioning".
7.3	
Running-in phase
The bearings and sliding surfaces are subject to a running-in phase. The 
increased friction at the start of the running-in phase results in increased heat 
development which decreases with increasing operating hours. The volumetric 
and mechanical-hydraulic efficiency increases as well through the conclusion of 
the running-in phase of approx. 10 operating hours.
Risk of damage by insufficient viscosity!
The increased temperature of the hydraulic fluid during the running-in phase can 
cause the viscosity to drop to impermissible levels.
Monitor the operating temperature during the running-in phase.
Reduce the loading (pressure, rpm) of the axial piston unit if impermissible 
operating temperatures and/or viscosities occur.
Warning!

Maintenance and repair
9.3	
Maintenance
The axial piston unit is low maintenance when used as intended.
The service life of the axial piston unit is heavily dependent on the quality of the 
hydraulic fluid. For this reason, we recommend changing the hydraulic fluid at 
least once per year or every 2000 operating hours (which ever occurs first) or 
having it analyzed by the hydraulic fluid manufacturer or a laboratory to determine 
its suitability for further use.
The service life of the axial piston unit is limited by the service life of the built-in 
bearings. The service life can be requested from the responsible Rexroth Service 
partner, see "9.5 Spare parts" for address. Based on these details, a maintenance 
period is to be determined by the system manufacturer for the replacement of the 
bearings and included in the maintenance schedule of the hydraulic system.
