Rolling Bearings
1. Introduction to 
Rolling Bearings 
1.1 Construction 
Most rolling bearings consist of an inner ring and 
an outer ring, rolling elements (either balls or rollers) 
and a retainer (cage). The cage separates the 
rolling elements at regular intervals holds them in 
place within the inner and outer raceways, and 
allows them to rotate freely. (fig 1.1-1.8) 
Rolling elements come in two basic shapes: ball 
or rollers. Rollers come in four basic types: 
cylindrical, needle, tapered, and spherical. 
Balls geometrically contact the raceway surfaces 
of the inner and outer rings at points, while the 
contact surface of rollers is a line contact. 
Theoretically, rolling bearings are so constructed 
as to allow the rolling elements to rotate orbitally 
while also rotating on their own axes at the same 
time. 
While the rolling elements and the bearing rings 
take any load applied to the bearings (at the contact 
point between the rolling elements and raceway 
surfaces), the case takes no direct load. It only 
serves to hold the rolling element at equal distances 
from each other and prevent them from falling out. 
1.2 Classification 
Rolling bearings fall into two main classifications: 
ball bearings and roller bearings. Ball bearings are 
Classified according to their bearing ring 
configurations: deep groove, angular contact and 
thrust types. Roller bearings on the other hand are 
classified according to the shape of the rollers: 
cylindrical, needle, taper and spherical. 
1.3 Characteristics 
Rolling bearings come in many shapes and 
varieties, each with its own distinctive features. 
However, when compared with sliding bearings, in 
rolling bearings the starting friction coefficient is lower 
and only a litte difference between this and the 
dynamic friction coefficient is produced. They are 
internationally standardized, interchangeable and 
readily obtainable. Lubrication is easy and 
consumption is low.

Rolling Bearings
Ball bearings and roller bearings 
When comparing ball and roller bearings of the same 
dimensions, ball bearings exhibit a lower frictional 
resistance and lower face run-out in rotation than roller 
bearings. 
This makes them more suitable for use in 
applications which require high speed, high precision, 
low torque and low vibration. Conversely, roller 
bearings have a larger load carrying capacity which 
makes them more suitable for applications requiring 
long life and endurance for heavy loads and shock 
loads.
 Radial and thrust bearings 
Most of rolling bearings can carry both radial and 
axial loads at the same time. 
Bearings with a contact angle of less than 45º have 
a much greater radial load capacity an classified as 
radial bearings. Bearings which have a contact angle 
over 45º have a greater axial load capacity and are 
classified as thrust bearings. There are also bearings 
classified as complex bearings which combine the 
loading characteristics of both radial and thrust 
bearings.

Rolling Bearings
2. Calculation of Service Life
To select an appropriate rolling contact bearing, 
it is necessary to know operating conditions, i.e., 
the magnitude and the direction of loads, the nature 
of loading applied, rotational speeds of one, or both, 
rings, the required service life, the working 
temperature of the bearing unit, and other 
requirements dependable on th structureal features 
of the machine in question. 
The beaing service life, is understood to mean 
the time expressed in total number of revolutions 
made by one of the bearing rings relative to the 
other rings, before fatigue failure sets in at one of 
the rings or any other rolling elements. It can be 
expressed in million of revolutions or operating 
hours. The basic rated resource (i.e., the estimated 
service life) means the operating life of a batch of 
bearings wherein not less than 90% of identical 
bearings would operate without any indication of 
fatigue failure on their bearing surfaces under 
similar loads and rotational speeds. The main 
certified characteristic of a bearing - the basic 
dynamic load-carrying rating, denoted with symbol 
C,-is a load to be sustained by a rolling contact 
bearing over the time it makes one million 
revolutions. Depending on the bearing design, the 
dynamic load-carrying capacity of bearings as 
estimated in accordance with the ISO 
Recommendations on Rolling Bearings, is given in 
Tables of the present Catalogue. 
The relationship between the basic rated 
resource, the dynamic load-carrying capacity rating, 
and the load acting on the bearing at a rotational 
speed of n>20 min-1 is calculated with the formula: 
C–r
L10 = ( )
p 
million rotations ....... 2.1
P 
Where 
L10 – is the basic rated resource, in 
million of revolutions; 
Cr – is the basic dynamic load-carrying 
capacity rating, N; 
P – is the equivalent dynamic load, N; 
P – is the exponent of a power, for ball 
bearings: P = 3; 
10
for roller bearings P = –3 
The basic rated resource is mainly expressed in 
operating hours: 
1000000
Cr
–––––––– 
P– 
....... 2.2
L10h = 
60n 
( )
p 
, hour 
where 
L10 – is the basic rated resource, hour; 
P – the rotational frequency, min-1 
For vehicles, the basic rated resource of hub bearings 
is sometimes more convenient to express in total 
kilometers running: 
π D1
L10S = –––– L10
1000 
Where 
L10S – is the basic rated resource, million 
kilometers (mln.km); 
D1 – is the wheel diameter in meters, m. 
Under normal operating conditions, the basic rated 
resource calculated at 90% reliability level (L10 ) satisfies 
the majority of cases of bearings employment, since 
actually attainable life is more than calculated one, 
Also, at 50% reliability the serviice life (L50 ) is, as a 
rule, five times as that of the basic rated resource (L10 ). 
To imporve the compactness of bearing units and to 
reduce their weight, it is not recommended to 
overestimate the basic rated resource. However, in a 
number of technical fields another level of reliability is 
required. Besides, due to the extensive research and 
development activity, it has been found that the 
conditions of lubrication greatly affect the bearing 
service life. Hence, ISO has introduced a notation of 
basic rated resource, the formula of which is o fthe 
following form: 
Cr
Lna = a1a2a3 P– or
( )
p 
....... 2.3
Lna = a1a2a3L10, 
Where Lna – is the adjusted rated resource/million 
revolutions, Factor n means the difference between 
the given reliability and 100% level (e.g., at 95% 
reliability, Lna = L5a ); 
a1 – is the reliability factor; 
a2 – is the material factor; 
a3 – is the operating conditions factor. 
For the generally adopted 90% reliability, as well as 
for proper bearing steel quality and lubrications 
conditions which ensure the separation of bearing 
surfaces in contact within the recommended limits, 
a1 = a2 = a3 = 1 and the formula for the adjusted rated 
resource (3) becomes identical to the main formula 
2.1.

However, it is expedient to use factor a1 only in case of an increase in factor a2 and a3; otherwise, an increase in 
overall dimensions of the bearing results, hence, a reduction in its speed, and increase in its weight and sluggishness 
of the rotating parts of the machine associated with this bearing. 
The operating conditions factor, a3, specifies mainly lubricant conditions, as well misalignment, housing and 
shaft rigidity, bearing arrangement; clearances in bearings. Considering the fact that the use of special, higher-
grade steels do not compensate the adverse effect of lubricant shortage, factore a2, and a3 are combined in one, 
with the notation a23.

Rolling Bearings
The values of the kinematic viscosity of oil, i.e., the 
operating viscosity, is determined with the help of a 
nompgraph, Fig 1. To obtain the operating viscosity, 
it is necessary to know the bearing temperature and 
the initial kinematic viscosity of the oil used. Fig 2. 
Contains a nomographic chart which is based on 
resilient hydrodynamic conditions of the lubricant, 
wherefrom we determine the normative (or standard) 
kinematic viscosity, v1. This arbitrary kinematic 
viscosity of oil is chosen as function of the speed of 
motion of the contact element; the latter is obtained 
based on the following two parameter: the mean 
diameter and the rotational speed. For example, to 
calculate the standard viscosity of oil, v1 , for a bearing 
with a rotational speed of n = 200 min–1 and a mean 
diameter of dm = 150 mm, it is necessary-from the 
X-axis of mean diameters-to pass over to the 
corresponding rotational speed which is represented 
by an inclined line, and choose on the Y-axis the 
respective value of v1 (v1 = 44 mm2S-1 in Fig. 2. 
Indicated with the arrow). 
The discussed procedure of determination of the 
viscosity coefficient is related to oil. For greases, this 
coefficient is found for a disperse media, i.e., on the 
base of the kinematic viscosity of the basic liquid oil 
which is a component of the grease. However, grease 
lubrication possesses certain special features of its 
own. 
Most often than not, the designer knows the desired 
service life of the machine component in question. If 
these data are not available, the basic design life may 
be recommended from Table 4. 
Equivalent Dynamic Load Calculation 
Equivalent dynamic load (P) applied to radial and 
angular contact ball and roller bearings is a constant 
radial load that, when applied to a bearing with the 
inner ring running and the outer ring fixed, ensures 
the same design service life as that under actual load 
and rotation conditions. For bearings of the above-
mention type, the equivalent load is found from the 
formula: 
Pr=XFr + YFa ....... 2.5
Where	
Pr – is the equivalent dynamic load, H; 
F – is the radial load constant in direction
r 
and value, H;
Fa – is the axial load constant in direction
and value, H;
X – is the coefficient of radial load;
Y – is the coefficient of axial load;
In case of Fa/Fr < e, is assumed, 
P  = F ....... 2.6
r
r 
Where 
e-is the limited value of Fa/Fr which 
determines the choice of factors X and Y. 
Values of X, Y and e are specified in this Catalogue. 
Accordingly, for an angular contact thrust bearing the 
equivalent dynamic load (Pa) is a constant axial load to 
be found in the same way: 
Pa = XFr + YFa ....... 2.7
while for a thrust bearing it has the following form: 
Pa = Fa ....... 2.8
The resultant load, F, acting upon th bearing can be 
determined rather accurately from laws of motion, if 
external forces are know, For example, loads 
transferred to the shafts/by machine elements are to 
be calculated as the reaction of the supports in 
accordance with equations for beams subjected to 
static loads. A shaft is regarded as a simply two 
supported beam resting in bearing supports. Using the 
momental equation and those for the sum of forces 
acting upon the beam, teh reaction of the supports is 
obtained; the latter, if taken with an opposite sign, 
represents the load applied to the bearing. The load is 
generated by the forces of the weight sustained by the 
bearing; by forces arising due to power transmission 
via the geartrain and/or belt transmission; by cutting 
forces in metal-cutting machine-tools; by inertial forces; 
by impact loads, etc. 
The resultant load on the bearing, F, directed at any 
angle to the bearing axis of rotation, may be resolved 
into a radial (Fr) and axial (Fa) components, Sometimes, 
it is rather difficult to determine this load because of 
teh variety of force factors and application of incidental 
forces. Hence, any mathermatical techniques are 
applicable to calculated the same. For practical 
purposes, there may be recommended certain 
approved procedures for calculation of the resultant 
force, F. 
If the force acting upon a bearing fluctuates linearly 
within Pmin to Pmax (e.g., at the supports of single-sided 
winding drums, then, the value of F has the form: 
F= Pmin+2Pmax 
3 
....... 2.9 
If operating duties are of a varying nature, i.e., load 
F1 acts within the period t1, at a rotational speed n1, 
while during the period t2, at a rotation speed n2 acts 
the load F2 and so on, then, the amount F takes the 
form:

The assessment of average values of loads in 
accordance with the aobe-mentioned relationships is 
valid not only for radial loads but, also, for any load of 
constant diretion of application relative to the bearing 
radial plane. For radial bearing, a radial load is 
calculated, and for a thrust bearing the load applied 
along the bearing axis. Whenever the force generated 
by the load is applied at an angle to teh radial plane 
of teh bearing, radial and axial components are to be 
calculated. An equivalent load (radial one in case of 
radial bearings and axial for thrust bearings) is 
assessed with these components accounted for.

Rolling Bearings

In a number of cases, it is not quite easy to perform 
accurate calculations of loading a bearing. For 
example, journal boxes of teh rolling stock take up 
not only the carriage weight force which is easy to 
determine by calculation. When on move at varying 
speeds. bearings are subjected to impact loads at rail 
joints and when passing railroad switches, inertaial 
loads on turns and during emergency breaking. 
Whenever these factors cannot be accounted for 
accurately, one resorts to the experience accrued on 
the machines of earlier prodution. 
Based on teh analysis of their operation, there has 
been derived a so-called loading factor, k6, to be 
multiplied into teh equivalent load as obtained from 
the equations 2.5 to 2.8 . In the equivalent load the 
inertial forces, inherent to the vibration machines, 
sieves, and vibratory mills, have been already 
accounted for. For smooth mild loads, without jerks, 
in such mechanisms as low-power kinematic reduction 
gears and drives, rollers for supporting conveyor belts 
, pulley tackles, trolleys, controls drives and other 
similar mechanisms, the magnitude of the loading 
factor is k6 = 1. The same value of the factor is taken if 
there is a belief in an accurate match between the 
calculated and actual loads. Table 2.5 contains 
recommended values of the loading factor k6. 
With the equivalent load (P) known, the basic rated 
resource (L10) selected, the basic dynamic load-carring 
capacity (C) is determinded by computation, and the 
required standard size is chosen from the Catalogue 
with due account of Table 2.1. 
Equivalent Static Load Calculation 
For a bearing at rest, under load P, the service life 
equation (1) is inapplicable , since at L = 0.p = ∞, the 
bearing cannot accommodate load as high as is 
wished. At a low rotational speed (n < 20 min6), P values 
turn out to be ovestated. Consequently, for bearings 
which rotate at low speeds, if at all, -especially when 
operated under impact loads-the allowable load 
depends on residual deformation orginating at points 
of contact of balls/rollers and rings rather than on the 
fatigue service life. The static load-carrying capacity 
of a bearing means the allowable load a bearing 
should withstand with no marked adverse impact on 
its further employment due to the residual deformation. 
Thus, the purely radial load, or purely axial load-
depending on whether the radial or angular contact 
bearings are in question-that results in combined 
(ring-ball/roller) residual deformation of up to 0,0001 
diameter of the rolling elements, is termed the basic 
static load-carrying capacity, denoted in general as 
C0, or C0r or C0a for radial and axial basic load carrying 
capacity,, respectively. In accordance with the ISO 
Standard, this amount of the residual deformation is 
caused by a load that generates a maximum rated 
contact street at the most highly loaded rolling element 
which is 4200 MPa for bearings (with teh exception of 
self-aligning double-row bearings), and 4000 MPa for 
roller bearings. In this Catalogue, values of the basic 
static load-carring capacity are given as calculated on 
the above bases. 
When testing a stationery (non-rotating) bearing for 
static load-carrying capacity under a load applied in 
any direction, it is necessary to calculate teh equivalent 
static load in that direction with which the static load-
carrying capacity of the bearing is associated. This 
equivalent static load results in the same amount of 
residual deformation. For radial and angular contact 
ball and roller bearings the magnitude of the equivalent 
static load, P0 is found from teh formula: 
Por = Xo Fr + Yo Fa ....... 2.12
and for angular-contact thrust ball and roller bearings 
Po is found as follows: 
Poa = Fa + 2,3Fr tga ....... 2.13
Where	
Por – is the equivalent static radial load, H; 
P  – is teh equvalent static axial load, H;
oa
F  – is the radial load or the radial
r
component of the load acting upon the
bearing, H;
P– is the axial load or the axial component
of the load acting upont the bearing, H;
Xo – is the radial load coefficient;
Yo – is the radial load coefficient;
a  – is the nominal contact angle of a
bearing, deg.
Thrust ball and roller bearings (a = 90o) are capable 
to withstand axial loads, only. The equal load for these 
types of bearings is calculated from teh formula Poa = Fa. 
The values of radial and axial load coefficients, as 
well as particular cases of application of Equations (12) 
and (13) are given in Tables of teh present Catalogue. 
It is necessary that teh load acting upon a bearing 
not to exceed the tabulated basic load-carrying 
capacity (Co). Deviations from this rule are based on 
experimental data. Thus, if the notion of the static 
safety coefficient So (So = C
P0
0 )is introduced, then, for a 
smooth. i.e., without vibrations and jerk load, low 
rotational speed, and low accuracy requirements, 
s > 0,5 overload can be admitted; under normal
o 
operating conditionals, so = 1-1,5 is accepted in the 
general machine-tool building industry; under impact 
loads, periodic static loads and strict requirements to 
the accuracy, the load is limited down to s = 1,5-2,5.

3. Tolerances 
For dimensional accuracy standards prescribe 
bearings). Running accuracy is defined as the 
tolerances and allowable error limitations for those 
allowable limits for bearing runout. Bearing runout

tolerances are included in the standards for inner and 
diameter, width, assembled bearing width, chamfer, 
outer ring radial and axial runout; inner ring side runout 
and taper) necessary when installing bearings on 
with bore; and outer ring outside surface runout with 
shafts or in housings. For machining accuracy the

Rolling Bearings
4. Fits 
4.1 Interference 
Bearing rings are fixed on the shaft or in the housing 
so that slip or movement does not occur between the 
mated surface during operation or under load. 
This relative movement, creep, between the fitted 
surfaces of the bearing and the shaft or housing can 
ocur in a radial direction, or in an axial direction, or in 
the direction of rotation. This creeping movement 
under load causes damage to the bearing rings, shaft 
or housing in the form of abrasive wear, fretting 
corrosionor friction crack. This can also lead to 
abrasive particles getting into the bearing, which can 
cause vibration, excessive heat, and lowered 
rotational efficiency. To insure that slip does not occur 
between the fitted surfaces of the bearing rings and 
the shaft or housing, the bearing is usually installed 
with an interference fit. 
Most effective interference fit is called a tight fit or 
shrink fit. The advantage of this tight fit for thin walled 
bearings is that it provides uniform load support over 
the entire ring circumference without any loss in load 
carrying capacity. 
However, with a tight interference-fit, ease of 
mounting and dismounting the bearing is lost; and 
when using a non-separable bearing as a non-fixing 
bearing, axial displacement is impossible. 
4.2 Calculation 
Load and interference 
The minimum required amount of interference 
for the inner rings mounted on solid shafts when 
acted on lby radial load, is found by formulae 
4.1 and 4.2. 
When Fr ≤ 0.3 Cor 
d.Fr 
dF =0.08 
B ............................................... 4.1
When Fr > 0.3 Cor 
Fr 
dF =0.02 B .................................................. 4.2
Where, 
dF : Required effective interference (for load) Hm 
d 
: Nominal bore diameter mm 
B 
: Inner ring width mm
Fr : Radial load N
Cor : Basic static rated load N
Temperature rise and interference 
To prevent loosening of the inner ring on steel shafts 
due to temperature increases (difference between 
bearing temperature and ambient temperature) 
caused by bearing roatation, and interference fit 
must be given. The required amount of interference 
can be found by formula (4.3). 
d T = 0.0015 .d. T.............................................. 4.3
Where, 
dT : Required effective interference (for temperature) 
Hm 
T : Difference between bearing temperature and
 ambient temperature ºC 
d : Bearing bore diameter mm 
Effective interference and apparent interference 
The effective interference (the actual interference 
after fitting) is different from the apparent interference 
derived from the dimensions measured value. This 
differenct is due to the roughness or slight variations 
of the mating surfaces, and this slight flattening of 
the uneven surfaces at the time of fitting is taken 
into consideration. 
The relation between the effective and apparent 
interference, which varies according to the finish 
given to the mating surfaces, is expressed by formula 
(4.4). 
d eff = d f – G........................................................ 4.4
Where, 
d eff : Effective interference Hm
d f : Apparent interference Hm
G = 1.0 ~ 2.5 Hm for ground shaft
= 5.0 ~ 7.0 Hm for turned shaft 
Maximum interference 
When bearing rings are installed with an interference 
fit on shafts or in housings, tension or compression 
stree may occur. If the interference is too large, it 
may cause damage to the bearing rings and reduce 
the fatigut life of the bearing. For these reasons, the 
maximum amount of interference should be less than 
1/1 000 of the shaft diameter, or 
21

Rolling Bearings
4.3 Selection 
Selection of the proper fit is generally based on the 
following factors: 1) the direction and nature of the 
bearing load 2) whether the inner ring or outer ring 
rotates 3) whether the load on teh inner or outer ring 
rotates or not 4) whether there is static load or direction 
indeterminate load or not. 
For bearings under rotating loads or direction 
indeterminate loads, a tight fit is recommended; but 
for static loads, a transition fit or loose fit should be 
sufficient. 
The interference should be tighter for heavy bearing 
loads or vibration and shock load conditions. Also, a 
tighter than normal fit should be given when the 
bearing is installed on hollow shafts or in housings 
with thin walls, or housingsa made of light alloys or 
plastic.
Table 4.1 Radial Load and bearing fit 
In applications where high rotational accuracy must 
be maintained, high precision bearings and high 
tolerance shafts and housing should be employed 
instead of a tighter interference fit to ensure bearing 
stability. High interference fits should be avoided if 
possible as they cause shaft or housing deformities to 
be induced into the bearing rings, and thus reduce 
bearing rotational accuracy. 
Because mounting and dismounting become very 
difficult when both the inner ring and outer ring of a 
non-separable bearing (for example a deep groove 
ball bearing) are given tight interference fits, one or 
the other ring should be given a loose fit.

4.4 Recommended fits 
Metric size standard dimension tolerances for 
bearing shaft diameters and housing bore diameters 
are governed by ISO 286. 
Accordingly, bearing fits are determined by the 
precision (dimensional tolerance0 of the shaft 
diameter and housing bore diameter. Widely used fits 
for various shaft and housing bore diameter 
tolerances, and bearing bore and outside diameters 
are shon in Fig. 4.1. 
Generally, recommended fits relating to the primary 
factors of bearing shape, dimensions, and load 
conditions are listed in Tables 4.2 and 4.3.

Rolling Bearings
5 Clearance 
5.1 Internal clearance 
Internal clearance of a bearing is the amount of 
internal clearance a bearing has before being installed 
on a shaft or in a housing. 
As in Fig.5.1, when either the inner ring or the outer 
ring is fixed and the other ring is free to move, 
displacement can take place in either an axial or radial 
direction. This amount of displacement (radially or 
axially) is termed the internal clearance and, 
depending on the direction, is called the radial internal 
clearance or the axial internal clearance. 
When the internal clearance of a bearing is 
measured, a slight measurement load is applied to 
the raceway so the internal clearance may be 
measured accurately. However, at this time, a slight 
amount of elastic deformation of the bearing occurs 
under the measurement load, and the clearance 
measurement value is slightly larger than the true 
clearance. This discrepancy between the true bearing 
clearance and the increased amount due to the elastic 
deformation must be compensated for. These 
compensation values are given in Table 5.1.  For roller 
bearings the amount of elastic deformation can be 
ignored.

5.2 Internal clearance selection 
The internal clearance of a bearing under operating 
conditions (effective clearance) is usually smaller than 
the same bearing’s initial clearance before being 
installed and operated. This is due to serveral factors 
including bearing fit, the difference in temperature 
between the inner and outer rings, etc. As a bearing’s 
operating clearance has an effect on bearing life, heat 
generation, vibration, noise, etc.; care must be taken 
in selectng the most suitable operating clearance. 
Effective internal clearance: 
The internal clearance differential between the initial 
clearance and the operating (effective) clearance (the 
amount of clearance reduction caused by interference 
fits, or clearance variation due to the temperature 
difference between the inner and outer rings) can be 
calculated by the following formula: 
f +
When 
eff = 
o – ( 
t)..................................... 5.1
Where, 
eff : Effective internal clearance  mm 
o : Bearing internal clearance  mm 
f : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
interference mm 
t : Reduced amount of clearance due to 
temperature differential of inner and outer 
rings mm 
Reduced clearance due to interference: 
When bearings are installed with interference fits 
on shafts and in housings, the inner ring will expand 
and the outer ring will contract; thus reducing the 
bearings’ internal clearance. The amount of expansion 
or contraction varies depending on the shape of the 
bearing, the shap of the shaft or housing, dimensions 
of the respective parts, and the type of material used. 
The differential can range from approximately 70% 
to 90% of the effective interference. 
f = (0.70 ~ 0.90)• deff ......................................... 5.2
Where, 
f 
: Reduced amount of clearance due to 
interference mm 
deff : Effective interference mm 
Reduced internal clearance due to inner/outer ring 
temperature difference: 
During operation, normally the outer ring will be from 
5x to 10xC cooler than the inner ring or rotating parts. 
However, if the colling effect of the housing is large, 
the shaft is Connected to a heat source, or a heated

substance is conducted through the hollow shaft; the 
temperature difference between the two rings can 
be even greater. The amount of internal clearance 
is thus further reduced by the differential expansion 
of the two rings. 
t = 
• r • Do ................................................... 5.3
Where, 
t : Amount of reduced clearance due to heat 
differential  mm 
: Bearing steel linear expansion coefficietn 
12.5x10-6/XC 
r : Inner/outer ring temperature differential XC 
Do : Outer ring raceway diameter  mm 
Outer ring raceway diameter, Do, values can be 
approximated by using formula (8.4) or (8.5). 
For ball bearings and self-aligning roller bearings, 
Do = 0.20 (d + 4.0D)............................................. 5.4
For roller bearings (except self-aligning) 
Do = 0.25 (d + 3.0D)............................................. 5.5
Where, d : Bearing bore diameter mm 
D : Bearing outside diameter mm 
5.3 Bearing internal clearance seletion 
standards 
Theoretically, as regards bearing life, the optimum 
operating internal clearance for any bearing would 
be a slight negative clearance after the bearing had 
reached normal operating temperature. 
Under actual operating conditions, maintaining such 
optimum tolerances is often difficult at best. Due to 
various fluctuating operating conditions this slight 
minus clearance can quickly become a large minus, 
greatly lowering the life of teh bearing and causing 
excessive heat to be generated. Therefore, an initial 
internal clearance which will result in a slightly greater 
than minus internal operating clearance should be 
selected. 
Under normal operating conditions (e.g. normal 
load, fit, speed, temperature, etc.), a standard internal 
cleracne will give a very staisfactory operating 
clearance. 
Table 5.2. lists non-standard clearance 
recommendations for various applications and 
operating conditions.

6. Speed and High 
Temperature Suitability 
6.1 Maximum Rotational speed 
The permissible rotational speed is given in the 
Catalogue for two kinds of lubricates: grease and liquid 
oil. However, it does not mean that the maximum 
rotational speed is acceptable at any load. The 
ultimate factor limiting the speed is temperature which 
depends on friction in the bearing and on the heat 
removal possibility. The limiting values of rotational 
speed given in the Catalogue are based on the 
following assumptions: the operating radial clearance 
is sufficient to enable compensation of the difference 
in the linear expansion between the outer and inner 
rings caused by their being heated to different 
temperatures; the assembly uses rigid shafts and 
housings; the lubricant is properly selected. The 
amount of the maximum permissible load is 
determined by the temperature factor. 
The maximum rotational speed found in the 
Catalogue can, in certain cases, be exceeded by 
changing the loading conditions and the lubricant. 
However,  in this case, care must be taken to apply a 
strictly specified dose of properly selected lubricant 
and to ensure removal of heat arising from friction. A 
further significant increase of the above-mentioned 
maximum rotational speed can be made possible by 
improvement of the bearings design, primarily that of 
bearing cages, by developing better lubricants, etc. 
Whenever problems arise in connection with the 
operation of bearings at higher rotational speed, 
please consult our personnel. 
6.2 Temperature Suitability 
FBJ bearings are heat treated in such a way that 
they can be used at operating temperatures of up to 
120ºc. Bearings with polyamide cages can be used 
operating temperatures of up to 100ºC only. 
If bearings are designed for operation under high 
temperature conditions, their life expectancy gets 
somewhat lower because of reduced hardness and 
fluctuation of the impact viscosity level. In order to 
prevent the parts dimensions form being changed, 
they are additionally tempered at high temperatures 
exceeding the maximum operating temperatures of 
bearings. Such bearings carry additional marking 
symbols placed to the right of the location of the 
bearing designation. Table contains the values of the 
selected dynamic load-carrying capacity should be 
multiplied depending on the bearing operating 
temperature.

7. Bearing Material 
7 Bearing Material 
The quality of bearings is influenced, to a large 
measure, by the properties of the material they are 
made of. 
Rings and rolling elements are fabricated 
predominantly of through-hardening carbon chromium 
bearing steel of high cleaniness. On delivery to the 
plant, all the purchased steel is tested for compliance 
with the basic technical specifications such as the 
chemical composition, contamination with non-metallic 
inclusions, metal structure. The examination is 
conducted at the plant’s specialized laboratories 
equipped with up-to date apparatus and instruments 
and manned with highly qualified specialists. 
The entire work on heat treatment and machining 
of the rings and rolling elements is carried out with 
the use of non-destructive testing facilities, which 
permits to assure high stability of the technological 
process. 
The plant performs systematic tests of the principal 
types of the manufactured bearings for fatigue life and, 
in so doing, checks the basic dynamic load-carrying 
ratings found in this Catalogue and the quality of the 
steel used. 
Table 7 Chemical Composition of Bearing Materials 
7.1 Rings and Balls 
Standard material for Rings and Balls is vacuum 
degassed high carbon chromium bearing steel (SUJ2*) 
allowing for high efficiency, low  torque, low noise level 
and long bearing life. Bearings require anti-corrosion 
properties, used stainless steel. 
7.2 Cage 
Cold rolled steel sheets or strips used for pressed 
cages and High tensile brass castings or machined 
steel is used for Machined cages. Polyamide material 
is used in moulded cages. Bearings require anti
corrosion properties used stainless steel cages. 
7.3 Shield 
Cold rolled steel sheets or strips is used for standard 
shields and bearings and require anti-corrosion 
properties used stainless steel. 
7.4 Seal 
All FBJ seals are made of molded synthetic nitrile 
rubber which can withstand the temperatures from 
-45ºC to 125ºC. 
7.5 Stainless Steel 
For bearings requiring anti-corrosion or heat 
resistance properties, rings and balls are made of 
martensitic stainless steel (SUS440C)** and this 
martensitic stainless steel is magnetic type. SUS 304 
is used In FBJ Stainless steel Cage and Stainless steel 
Shield.

8. Lubrication and storage 
8.1 Lubrication 
Bearing lubrication reduces friction and wear, acts 
as a coolant, minimizes contamination, prevents 
corrosion, and generally extends bearing life. 
Selecting the best lubricant for your specific 
application becomes a very important decision; 
however, choosing from the hundreds available can 
be an overwhelming task. FBJ’s engineering staff is 
available to help make the right decision for your 
application. 
Table 8.1 Reccomended Oils in Industrial Use 
Table 8.2 Greases used in FBJ Bearings 
8.2 Oil Lubrication 
Oil is the basic lubricant for ball and roller bearings. 
The main adventage if an oil lubricant is that there is 
less bearing torque. The use of synthetic oils such as 
diesters, silicone polymer, and fluorinated compounds 
has improved volatility and viscosity characteristics and 
increased temperature properties.

Rolling Bearings
8.3 Grease Lubrication 
For lubrication of rolling bearings, use is mainly made 
of grease, because the techniques of their 
employment are more simple, they do not require 
complicated sealing devices and demand less 
expenditures for the maintenance of mechanisms. 
When a machine or a mechanism is stopped, grease 
does not run off from the bearing but remains there 
and even seals the assembly isolating it from the 
surroundings. These and other advantages of greases 
are so decisive that allow the wear of bearings to be 
ignored. The use of grease brings about a more rapid 
wear than when operating with oils due to the 
accumulation of abrasive particles in the former. 
Greases are obtained by solidifying lubricating oils 
with the aid of various thickening agents. Such 
silidification agent creates a structural framework of 
interwoven fibers which imparts plasticity to the 
lubricating material and retains lubricating oil in its cells. 
Grease is well held in place in a bearing, does not 
flow out under the effect of the force of gravity and 
resists the action of centrifugal forces attempting to 
throw lubricant away from the bearing during its 
rotation. The properties of grease are determined by 
the composition of the thickening agent. 
For rolling bearing lubrication, use is normally made 
of grease in which mineral oil is solidified with the aid 
of sodium, calcium or lithium soaps. 
Rolling bearings should be filled with grease just 
immediately before the unit is to be assembled. The 
decisive reason for this is very stringent requirements 
to the lubricant purity. The later the lubricant is put in, 
the lesser the danger of its getting contaminated. 
The bearing type or design features of a unit may 
demand it to be filled with grease at a later stage. 
Thus, for instance, if it is necessary to adjust the 
amount of clearance in bearings with a tapered inner 
bore, the required measurements can be only 
performed before the unit is filled with grease. It is 
also impracticable to put in grease before the bearing 
is heated for mounting. Preliminary packing a bearing 
with grease is only recommended when it is impossible 
to distribute grease over rolling elements and 
raceways after assembly. 
Normally, a bearing as a whole and the free space 
in the unit housing is only partially filled with grease-
from 30 to 50%. However, when using lithium-base 
lubricants for supports that are not subjected to strong 
vibration, the free space of the housings can be filled 
up to 90% disregarding the danger of overheating. 
When a support is filled with a larger than normal 
amount of grease, this improves the reliability of 
protection against contamination and prolongs the 
support’s service life. 
High-speed rolling bearings, for example, spindle 
units of metal-cutting machine tools mush be lubricated 
with a small amount of grease in order to limit the 
temperature of unit heating. In supports subjected to 
strong vibration, for example, in the hubs of motor car 
wheels and in the boxes of railroad car wheels, as 
well as in vibration machines, grease should fill not 
more than 60% of the free space. 
The technique of packing a bearing unit with grease 
is selected depending on the bearing type. 
Separable bearings (cylindrical, tapered, thrust-type) 
are filled with grease following the sequence of 
assembly, applying a thin layer on the raceway of the 
installed ring and then filling the space between the 
rolling elements. 
In inseparable bearings, for example, in radial and 
angular contact bearings grease should be stuffed in 
form both ends. Self-aligning ball bearings and 
spherical roller bearings can be filled with grease by 
turning the ring and stuffing the lubricant in between 
the rolling elements. 
8.4 Solid Lubrication 
A solid film lubrication can range from simple 
sacrifical retainers, graphite, or molybdenum 
disulphide (MoS2) powders, to complexion sputtering 
or plating. Each type must be ehgineered for the 
specific application. They are very useful in areas of 
temperature extremes, vacuum, radiation, pressure, 
or harsh environments where coventional lubricants 
would fail. Solid film lubricants do not deteriorate in 
storage.

Rolling Bearings
8.5 Storage Of Bearings 
Rolling bearings have high-quality working surfaces. 
Any deterioration of the surface quality results in a 
premature wear and reduction in the service life of 
bearings. 
Bearings are made predominantly of ferrous metals, 
therefore, the main danger for them is corrosion which 
is absolutely intolerable on the working surfaces of 
bearings. To prevent in-storage corrosion, bearings 
are delivered to the customer in a preserved state, 
i.e., washed to remove dirt, contamination, slushed 
with corrosion-protective lubricant - mineral oil with 
an inhibitor, and packed in special packing. 
The time this lubricant will be capable of protecting 
the bearing against corrosion depends on storage 
conditions. The customer’s task is to store bearings 
in conformity to the Manufacturer’s instructions. 
The occurrence of corrosion of bearings during 
storage depends on two main factors: 
1) relative air humidity in the storage place: the lower 
the humidity, the weaker the process of corrosion. No 
in-storage corrosion is practically observedc when 
relative humidity is below 40% 
2) temperature gradient in the storage premises 
during the day. The smaller the temperature difference, 
the more favorable the storage conditions. Great 
temperature fluctuations are particularly dangerous 
when there is a high relative humidity. In this case 
moisture can condense on the surfaces of bearings, 
increasing sharply the probability of corrosion. These 
factors need to be considered when establishing 
requirements to bearing storage premises. 
A room used for storage of bearings must be dry, 
heated, well ventilated, located far from places where 
the air contains trings of substances that cause metal 
corrosion-away from chemical, pickling, galvanic 
shops. The storage room air temperature must be kept, 
as far as possible, within 10 to 30˚C. The daily 
temperature variation should not exceed 5˚C. 
Relative air humidity in the storage room should not 
be in excess of 60%. It is desirable that it should be as 
low as possible. The bearing storage conditions in the 
room (humidity and temperature) should be 
continuously monitored. 
It is recommended to store large-size bearings with an 
inner diameter over 200mm placed on their end-faces to 
avoid possible deformation of the thin-walled rings.

Rolling Bearings
9. Mounting And Dismounting
9.1 Mounting 
Ball and roller bearings should be mounted by 
qualified personnel paying special attention to keeping 
them clean: this is very important for ensuring 
satisfactory operation of bearings and preventing their 
premature breakdown. 
9.2 Preparation of Mounting 
The mounting should be preferably done in a room 
with dry clean air located far from the sources of dust, 
emulsion, dirt. The shaft and housing surfaces mating 
with the bearings should be thoroughly washed with 
gasoline or kerosene, wiped, dried and coated with a 
thin layer of lubricant. Care must be taken to check 
the accuracy of dimensions and shapes of all the parts 
mating with the bearing; they should not exceed the 
dimensions. 
The manufacturer’s packing is to be removed from 
the bearings immediately before mounting to prevent 
penetration of dirt. Preservative coating is removed 
from the mounting surfaces only. The mounting 
surfaces are to be washed with gasoline or kerosene 
and wiped dry with clean nap-free cloth. If a bearing 
is dirty or its packing is damaged, it should be 
thoroughly washed prior to mounting. The mounting 
surfaces in this case are to lubricated with medium-
viscosity oil. 
Prior to mounting, check the bearing appearance, 
marking, ease of rotation, clearances for compliance 
with the requirements of the technical documents and 
this Catalogue. 
Radial clearance in spherical roller bearings are 
measured with the aid of a set of feeler gauges, or by 
other methods. Feeler gauges are used to measure 
clearances between the outer ring and the unloaded 
roller. Prior to mounting, bearings, especially those 
with the ratio of the length and the largest shaft 
diameter exceeding 8, must be tested for straightness 
(absence of bending). 
9.3 Mounting of bearings 
The method of bearings mounting (mechanical, 
hydraulic, thermal) depends on their type and size. 
In all the cases, it is very important to protect rings, 
bearing cages, rolling elements against direct knocks, 
because they can damage the bearings. The principal 
rule to be observed when mounting a bearing is never 
to allow the compressing force to be transferred 
through rolling elements. 
When mounting a bearing, it is necessary to ensure 
the required precision of the bearing rings location with 
respect to the rotation axis which mainly depends on 
the absence of misalignment. Misalignments of rings 
is one of the factors causing initial damages of bearings 
and concentration of contact stresses. The operating 
misalignment of the rings should not exceed 0.7 
maximum design-permissible angle of alignement of 
the bearing rings under normal operating conditions 
(this parameter is to be taken from the description of 
bearing groups). 
It is should be borne in mind that the outer ring of a 
spherical radial bearing has the property of readily 
swivel out. To replace the ring in its original position, it 
is necessary to set the dislocated (braking) rollers, with 
the aid of fingers, back into the outer ring and restore 
the latter to its original position. NEVER knock on the 
ring or rollers with a hammer. 
9.4 Bearings with Cylindrical Bore 
When mounting inseparable bearings, usually the 
ring with a tighter fit is to be mounted the first. If pre-
loading in the tight fit is not too high, small-size bearings 
can be mounted by knocking lightly with a hammer on 
Figure 9.1 
the sleeve installed on the front end or the bearings 
ring. 
Knocks should be uniformly distributed over the 
circumference to prevent the bearing from 
misalignment. When an aligning bar is used instead 
of the sleeve, the force must be applied at the center 
36

Figure 9.2 
(see Figure 9.1). If the bearing is inseparable, it 
should be simultaneously pressure-fitted onto the 
shaft and into the housing seat (see Figure 9.2) with 
the aid of the mounting tool shown in the sketch, a 
mounting ring is inserted between the bearing and 
aligning bar, resting on the front ends of the inner 
and outer rings. The supporting surfaces of the 
mounting ring should lie in the same plane to ensure 
even distribution of the forces applied to both Rings 
during the mounting procedure. When mounting self-
Figure 9.3 
aligning bearings, for example, spherical roller 
bearings, the use of an intermediate mounting rings 
permits to prevent misalignment and turning of the 
outer ring after the bearing with the shaft has been 
installed in the housing seat (see Figure 9.3). 
The intermediate mounting ring must have a groove 
to keep it form touching the rolling elements or bearing 
cages. Bearings having a diameter of up to 100 mm 
can be pressure-fitted onto the shaft in cold state with 
the use of mechanical or hydraulic presses. 
The inner ring of a separable bearing can be 
mounted independently of the outer ring. When 
Figure 9.4 
mounting a shaft already carrying the inner ring into 
the housing with the outer ring care should be taken 
to make them properly centered, otherwise the 
raceways, balls or rollers can get scored. That is why, 
when mounting bearings with needle and cylindrical 
Figure 9.5 
rollers, it is recommended to use a mounting sleeve 
(see Figure 9.4). The outer diameter of the sleeve must 
be equal to the raceway diameter F of the inner ring 
machined with a d10 accuracy. The values of F are 
given in the bearings table. Needle roller bearings with 
a die-stamped outer ring best mounted with the aid of 
a special aligning bar (see Figure 9.5).

Rolling Bearings
Large-size bearings or those with tight fit should be 
heated before mounting. NEVER pre-heat bearings 
in excess of 120XC, for this may cause changes of 
both the bearing material, as well as possible burning 
or deformation of polya-mide bearing cages. DO NOT 
pre-heat bearings having protective shields or seals, 
because they are filled with grease. 
When pre-heating bearings, care should to be taken 
to avoid local overheating. Uniform safe Heating can 
be achieved with the aid of electric heaters, heating 
furnaces and oil bath. 
It is also recommended to use special electric 
induction heaters. Here the bearing (ring) is heated 
by an alternating magnetic field which gives rise to 
eddy currents. After induction heating the bearings 
(rings) need to be demagnetized. 
9.5 Bearings with Tapered Bore 
Inner rings of tapered-bore bearings are always 
mounted with a tight fit. The amount of interference in 
this case is determined not by the shaft size tolerances 
as for cylindrical-bore bearings, but by shifting the 
bearings along the conical surface of the shaft 
mounting journal, of adapter or withdrawal sleeve. 
Double-row spherical roller bearings with tapered 
bore are mounted onto cylindrical shaft with the aid 
of adapter or withdrawal sleeves, while on tapered-
journal shafts they are installed directly on the shaft. 
Before mounting, the washed bearing bore and the 
sleeve may be covered with a thin coat of lubricant. A 
thicker lubricant layer will reduce friction and, in so 
doing, facilitate mounting, but in the course of 
operation the lubricant will be pressed out from the 
mounting joints. As a result, the fit will lose tightness 
and the ring or the sleeve will run wearing out the 
mounting surfaces. 
It is a good practice to mount bearings with the bore 
of up to 70 mm and normal tightness using a hammer 
and a mounting sleeve screwed onto the threaded 
shaft end. The pressure part acts on the adapter 
sleeve end or directly on the inner ring end-face (when 
mounting is carried out without adapter and withdrawal 
sleeves). Bearings with a diameter exceeding 100 mm 
should be mounted using a hydraulic formed 
(expanded) along with the axial shift of the adapter 
sleeve. 
When any previously dismounted bearing is to be 
mounted again, it is not sufficient to restore the lock 
nut to its original position, because after a prolonged 
operation the radial clearance fit loose due to the wear 
of the thread and smoothing of the mounting seats, 
the shift gets longer. For self-aligning spherical roller 
bearings the values of teh decrease in teh original 
radial clearance which are neccessary to ensure a tight 
static fit. The radial clearance of spherical roller 
bearings is measured with the use of feelre gauges in 
both roller rows simultaneously. It is necessary to 
observe that the rollers are pressed against the meddle 
flange (a guiding lip). Yhe outer and inner rigns should 
be located so as to ensure equal radial calearance for 
both rows. 
The method of mounting bearings is selected based 
on teh mounting conditions. 
Small-and medium-size bearings can be fitted onto 
the mounting seats with the aid of the lock nut. The 
nut is tighteded using a box wrench (see Figure 9.6). 
Figure9.6 
Small-size bearings with an adapter sleeve are 
mounted onto the tapered surface of the adapter sleeve 
with the aid of teh lock nut (see Figure 9.7). 
Figure 9.7 
Small-size withdrawal sleeves are pressure-fitted 
with the aid of the lock nut into the gap between the 
shaft and the inner ring (see Figure 9.8).

Rolling Bearings
Figure 9.8 
The nuts of larger-size bearings require a greater 
tightening force. In these cases mounting can be 
made easier with the use of a mut with thrust bolts 
shown in Figure 9.9. To prevent the bearing or sleeve 
from being wedged, it is necessary to screw up the 
Figure 9.9 
nut preliminarily unitl it comes fully against the 
mounting sleeve. The thrust bolts made of improved 
steel and located evenly along the circumference (the 
number of bolts depends on the force required) are 
screwed in uniformly in a cross manner until the 
necessary decrease of radial 
clearance is obtained. Since 
a tapered mounting surface 
provides self-braking, the 
accessory may be, then, 
removed and the bearing can 
be fastened tight with it own 
fastening nut. This principle is 
applicable for bearings 
mounted on a sleeve or 
directly on a tapered journal. 
When mounting large-size 
bearings, 
a 
hydraulic 
accessory, for example, a 
Figure 9.11 
circular piston pump, is normally usrd, to mount a 
bearing or to press-fit a sleeve (see Figure 9.10). The 
ring can be shifted axially with the aid of a screw - or 
hydraulically-operated nut (for large-sizebearings). A 
hydraulically driven nut has 
Figure 9.10 
a cylindrical groove on one of the end which serves 
for insertion of a round piston provided with an O-ring 
seal. The nut is connected, by means of a hose, with a 
pump feeding oil to the nut. the pump is a jet-type oil 
pump with a flexible high pressure hose. The nut piston 
is moved by oil pressure, then it is extended and 
pressure-fits the bearing onto the mounting seat. 
The most expedient method of mounting large-size 
bearings (with the bore diameter of over 300-mm) is 
the use of a hydraulic outward thrust which affords high 
- quality mounting of a bearing. For this purpose, 
special channels and grooves are made on the shaft 
to enadle oil to be fed to under the bearing inner ring. 
When employing hydraulically-aided mounting, pump-
driven oil is supplied via the oil-conducting channels 
and grooves to the contact zone of the bearing inner 
ring and the shaft. The pressurized oil fed to the contact 
zone of the rings and the shaft thrusts the ring 
outwards, thus permitting axial displacement of the ring 
along the shaft (see Figure 9.11).

Rolling Bearings
When mounting a bearing on a tapered sleeve, 
hydraulic fluid can be supplied through the channels 
located in the sleeve itself. 
When mounting a bearing into the housing with a 
tight fit, it is recommended, before mounting, either 
to pre-cool the bearing (with liquid nitrogen or dry ice) 
or to preheat the housing. 
When mounting bearings, especia those that are 
subjected to axial loads, it is advisable whenever 
possible to make sure, with the use of a feelre gauge 
or a light slit, that the bearing ring end-faces abut 
properly and tightly (without misalignment) to the 
shoulder ends. A similar check should be made on 
the opposite bearing ends and the ends of the parts 
pressing them in the axial direction. 
It is necessary to check the correctness of the 
mutual loaciton of bearings in the supports of one 
shaft. When the supports of one shaft are installed in 
different split housings, they should be checked, after 
installation of the housing, for correctness of their 
mutual position, i.e.; they must be accurately in line 
with each other. After mounting, the shaft must be 
easily started by hand and rotate freely and evenly. 
9.6 Running Tests 
After the bearing has been mounted and checked 
for ease of rotation, the unit is filled with a prescribed 
type of lubricant and subjected to running tests aimed 
at checking the noise level created by the runnung 
bearing and the working temperature. 
The running test should be performed under partial 
loading at low and medium rotational speeds. NEVER 
can bearings, especially thrust-type and angular 
contact thrust bearings, be tested under no-load 
conditions, nor be accelerated immediately to high 
speeds, because in this case balls and rollers will slip 
over raceway and damage it, or excessive stresses 
may arise in the bearing cage, Noise credted by the 
bearing retation should be checked with the use a 
stethoscope, tube or hollow rod. Properly mounted 
and well lubricated bearings produce a soft, slightly 
buzzing noise in their operation. 
The ocurrence of a shrill noise may be the evidence 
of improper mounting, misalignment, damage form 
the use of hammer; non-uniform noise or knocking 
reveals teh presence of foreign particles in teh 
bearing; a metallic sound is indicative of an insufficient 
clearance in the bearing; a whishtling or gritting sound 
points to insufficient lubrication. 
A rise of bearing temperature immediately after 
starting is a normal event, with time temperature gets 
stabilized. Abnormally high temperatures or persisten 
temperature variations point to an excessive amount 
of lubricant in the unit, an unduly tight fit of the bearing 
in teh radial or axial direction, an improper 
workmanship of teh mating parts which causes 
catching of the bearing cage or rolling elements, s 
stronger friction of seals, or mutual tiltness of the rings. 
Make sure to check the quality of seales and operation 
of the lubricating equipment during the running tests. 
The running test process can be considered completed 
only after stabilization of the bearing temperature 
conditions. 
9.7 Dismounting 
Bearing dismounting should be made without 
damage of bearings of bearings and mating parts. If 
bearings are to be used again after the machine has 
been disassembled, the dismounting effort shall not 
be transmitted through rolling elements. With 
separable bearings, one ring, together with the rolling 
elements and the bearing cage, can be removed 
independently of the other ring. Dismantling of non
separable bearings should begin with the removal of 
a more loosely fitted ring. 
9.8 Bearings with Cylindrical Bore 
Small-size bearings can be removed from the shaft 
by lightly knocking with a hammer on the aligning bar 
made from light metals, shifting the bar over teh 
bearing ring circumference. Larger-size bearings are 
normally dismantled with the use of various extractor: 
mechanical screw-type and hydraulically-driven 
Figure 9.12 
removers (see Figure 9.12). the remover rods are 
pressed directly to the face of the ring to be removed 
or to the adjacent part. Use may be made of removers 
carrying stripping rings or half-rings, as well as of three-
rod screw removers. 
42 

---

Rolling Bearings
To facilitate future dismantling, designers should 
make provision for slots in the shaft or housing 
shoulders permitting insertion of the extraction tools, 
or for insertion of withdrawal ringshoulders. 
The outer ring will be more readily removed from 
housings if teh latter have threaded holes for driving 
in thrust screws. 
The force applied to remove a bearing is generally 
much greater than that necessary for pressure-fitting, 
as teh ring sets down with time or fretting can occur, 
i.e., corrosion (rust from friction) and microseizure of 
the ring and shaft metal. 
Large-size bearings mounted with a tight fit usually 
require great effort for removal. The use of an oil-
pressure fitting method (Supply of oil under pressure 
to teh mounting surface) will substantially facilitate 
the dismantling procedure. Of course, oil channels 
and distribution grooves necessary for this purpose 
should be provided for at the stage of the bearing 
assembly design. 
9.9 Bearings with Tapered Bore 
Dismantling of bearings located on an adapter 
sleeve starts with loosing the lock nut and screwing it 
out a few turns. Then a special intermediate part-a 
knock-out bar and a hammer are used to loosen the 
fit between the sleeve and the bearing (see Figure 
9.13). When a press is used. the adapter sleeve or 
Figure 9.13 
the loosended nut should be supported and the 
bearing should be pressed off from the adapter 
sleeve. 
Dismounting of withdrawal sleeve of mounted 
bearings beings with the removeal of teh axial locking 
elements (the shaft nut, thrust washer, end cover, and 
Figure 9.14 
the like), then a withdrawal nut is screwed onto the 
sleeve thread until the sleeve fit in the bearing ring 
gets loose (see Figure 9.14). If the threaded portion of 
the sleeve goes beyong the shaft journal, a supporting 
ring should be inserted into the sleeve bore to protect 
the thread from damage when the nut is being screwed 
on. Ind difficult cases, especially when dismantling 
large-size bearings, use can be made of extraction 
Figure 9.15 
nuts with additonal thrust bolts (see Figure 9.15). 
A washer is inserted between the inner ring and the 
thrust bolts. 
If a bearing is abutted on teh lock ring, the simplest 
way of dismantling withdrawal sleeves is to remove 
them with the aid of a circular poston pump (see Figure 
9.16). 
The most simple and reliable technique of 
dismantling bearings fitted on a tapered shaft journal 
or those installed with teh aid of tapered sleeve, is to 
remove them using dydraulically-driven nuts or by 
means of an oil-pressure fillting method, i.e., by 
supplying oil to the contact zone of the inner ring and 
the shaft (see Figure 9.17, 9.18). When oil is fed under 
high pressure, the tight fit repidly gets looser and teh 
bearing is readily removed from the shaft journal. 
43 

---

The hydraulic method is acceptable for both
cylindrical and tapered fits, In both cases the shaft
must be provided with oil grooves, supply channels
and connecting threads. Large-size adapter and
withdrawal sleeves must possess corresponding
grooves and holes.
it should be borne in mind that when oil is forced in
between   tapered mounting surfaces, teh pressure
joint is immediately released. To prevent accidents
while dismounting, it is necessary to limit the axial
motion (shift) of teh bearing or withdrawal sleeve with
teh aid of teh lock nut, fastening sleeve nut or with a
stop.

Dry Bushings
FEATURES
1.
The bearing surfaces have such low coefficients
of static and dynamic friction that they require no
lubrication.
DU bearings can also be used in lubricants.
2.
The operating temperature range extends from -
200ºC to 280ºC.
3.
DU bearings operate smoothly under loads which
exert high levels of resistance, impact, intermittent
motion, and thrust.
4.
DU bearings are free from electrostatic induction.
When installed, each DU bearing has an electrical
resistance of 1Ω to 10Ω per 1 cm2 wide contact
area.)
5.
The bearing surface is highly resistant to most
industrial chemicals and solvents including gas,
oil, and alcohol.
Smooth, Oilless Operation
The Dry Bushing (or DU bushing) is the ultimate in
oilless 
bearing 
design, 
using 
lead 
and
tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) having excellent wear
resistance which optimizes metal properties such as
strength and dimensional stability.
Coefficients of static and dynamic friction are so small
that the bearing surfaces run smoothly without
lubrication, while at the same time eliminating sticking
and slipping. Unlike regular bearings which require
constant lubrication, the DU type does away with the
need for costly maintenance. It is also possible to
combine them with parts totally submerged in a
lubricant.
131
Design
Bronze
Steel Outer Surface
Mixture of Polyteflon
6.
The mating surface (mounting shaft) is wear
resistant.
7.
Service life is extended.
8.
DU bearings are light and thin (up to 3 mm thick),
requering little  space and permit compact
equipment design.
9.
DU bearings minimize operating noise.
10. Standard DU bearings are available for quick
delivery.
Non-standard DU bearings can be made to order.
