GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Selection of bearing type
 Each type of bearing displays characteristics 
features which make it suitable for a certain 
application. Therefore, many bearings types and 
constructive versions have been developed so that 
they can satisfy various demands for rolling bearings. 
No general rule can be given, taking into account 
the great number of factors to be considered when 
selecting a bearing type.
 We give further the most important criteria to be 
considered when selecting the bearing type.
Selection of bearing type,
considering the load magnitude
and direction
Radial load
 Deep groove ball bearings are the most suitable 
types of bearings for light and moderate pure radial 
loads. For heavy radial load and where large-diameter 
shafts are used, double row cylindrical roller bearings 
are the adequate choice. 
Axial load
 For pure axial loads, single direction thrust ball 
bearings are used in case of loads acting in one 
directions. For loads acting in both directions, 
double direction thrust ball bearings are used. 
Angular contact thrust ball bearing and single or 
double row angular contact ball bearings, are used 
in case of light or moderate pure axial loads at 
moderate speeds.
 For light axial loads at high speeds, deep groove 
ball bearings are suitable. Under the axial load, a 
contact angle different from 0° is generated in these 
bearings and therefore they operate as angular 
contact ball bearings.
 In order to increase axial load carrying capacity, 
a larger clearance should be selected (C3, C4). For 
moderate axial loads at high speed, angular contact 
ball bearings in tandem arrangement are used so that 
they can take over loads acting in both directions.
Combined load
 In order to carry combined radial and axial loads 
acting simultaneously, bearings with a contact angle 
different from 0° are used. The greater the contact 
angle, the greater the axial load carrying capacity.
 Self-aligning ball bearings, spherical roller 
bearings or cylindrical roller bearings (NJ, NUP, NJ + 
HJ types), can also accommodate combined loads of 
certain values. But there are some limit values of the 
ratio Fa/Fr, which are shown in bearing tables and 
cannot be exceeded. Cylindrical roller bearings can 
carry axial loads by means of the sliding friction on 
ribs. For this reason, the load is limited according to 
the indications on pages 158, 159.
 Bearings which accomodate only one direction 
axial loads should always be mounted in pairs so that 
they can carry axial loads in both directions.
Selection of bearing type considering 
the alignment between shaft and 
housing
 Angular misalignments occur generally when 
the shaft bends under the operating load or when 
bearings joint parts have deviations of form or 
position.
 In such cases, self-aligning ball bearings, spherical 
roller bearings or spherical roller thrust bearings 
should be used.
 A certain bearing bending angle which can 
compensate for errors of alignment and maximum 
angle values are shown for each type in the 
introductory texts of the table sections.
 When misalignments should be compensated, 
radial and axial clearance are important. The 
larger the clearance, the greater the possibility of 
self-aligning.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 If the misalignment exceeds the permissible 
values shown in the introductory texts of the 
bearing tables, the bearing rating life decreases. 
The greater the ratio Fr/C0r, the shorter the rating 
life. If 0,1 < Fr/C0r < 3, the rating life decreases 
with about 25%.
Selection of bearing type considering 
the operating temperature
 Bearings are generally used up to a temperature of 
maximum +120°C. In case of higher temperatures, 
bearings with special heat treatments should be 
used, in accordance with specifications on page 23.
Sealed bearings, 2RS type, should be used 
at operating temperatures up to 80°C. If this 
temperature is exceeded, the efficiency of lubricants 
is considerably reduced.
Selection of bearing internal clearance
 In most cases, while operating, bearings should 
have a small radial clearance that can be defined 
as “the possible value of displacement in radial 
direction of one bearing ring in relation to the other 
without parts deformations”.
 While operating, bearing internal clearance is 
different from the one at delivery, since the latter 
is reduced when mounting bearings with a certain 
tight fit.
 Under operating conditions, internal clearance 
change is also caused by different temperatures 
between the outer and inner ring. Bearings are 
generally delivered with a normal radial or axial 
clearance according to the values shown for each 
rolling bearing group.
 The decrease in radial clearance due to the tight 
fit and operating temperature is considered to be 
between 60-80% of the tightening value, depending 
on bearing series and size.
 After the clearance in bearings has been 
decreased, a large enough operational clearance 
should remain, so that the lubricant film shouldn’t 
be destroyed.
 Deep groove ball bearings should have an 
operational clearance close to zero. There may 
be often a light preload, due to the point-contact 
between the rolling elements and raceways.
 Small-sized cylindrical roller bearings should have 
an operational clearance of 5-10 µm and larger-
sized bearings a clearance of 10-30 µm.
 Bearings can also be manufactured - at request - 
with radial and axial clearance smaller (C1 and C2) or 
larger (C3, C4 and C5) than normal, so that the most 
favorable operating conditions for bearings should 
be assured.
 Cylindrical roller bearings can be manufactured 
with non-interchangeable rings (suffix NA).
 Bearings with non-interchangeable parts have 
a different radial clearance than bearings with 
interchangeable parts. Changing rings from one 
bearing to another is not allowed.
 In case of bearings with interchangeable parts, 
rings may be changed and the values of radial 
clearance will not be altered.
Bearing types and technical 
characteristics
 URB bearings can be manufactured in various 
type and size, so that they can meet the customers’ 
requirements assuring a proper reliability for various 
applications.
 Table 1.1 shows suitability of each group of bearings, 
considering the main technical characteristics.
 Bearing type is selected depending on the technical 
characteristics required by a certain application.
 A suggestive graphic symbol has been determined 
for each main technical characteristic. Thus, a proper 
bearing for each purpose can be easily chosen. 
According to the specifications in this catalogue, 
the proper type and size of bearing can be selected, 
togheter with all manufacturing and operating 
technical conditions.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The size of a bearing is selected considering 
as usually factor magnitude of the load, and also 
selection depends on the operational rating life and 
prescribed operating safety.
Basic load ratings
 The basic dynamic load rating Cr is used to 
evaluate bearing dimensions while rotating under 
load. It expreses the bearing admissible load which 
will give a basic rating life up to 1000 000 revolutions.
 The basic dynamic load ratings of URB bearings 
have been determined in accordance with 
international standard ISO 281. The values are given 
in bearing tables.
 Considering the basic dynamic load rating, can be 
calculated the service time until the “metal fatigue” 
of rolling contact surfaces appears, determining this 
way the rating life.
 The other characteristic, basic static load rating 
Cor, is considered in case of low speeds, low 
oscilating movements or in the stationary case.
 The basic static load rating is defined in accordance 
with ISO 76, as the load acting upon the stationary 
bearing. It corresponds to a calculated contact stress 
in the center of the contact area between the most 
heavily loaded rolling element and the raceway, of:
 4 600 MPa for self-aligning ball bearings,
 4 200 MPa for all other ball bearings,
 4 000 MPa for all roller bearings.
 This stress produces a permanent deformations 
of the rolling element and raceway which is about 
0,0001 of the rolling element diameter. The loads 
are pure radial for radial bearings and pure axial for 
thrust bearings.
Bearing life
 The life of a rolling bearing is defined as the 
number of revolutions or the number of operating 
hours, which the bearing is capable to endure, before 
the first sign of metal fatigue occurs on one of its 
rings, on the raceway or the rolling elements.
 If we want to consider only the fatigue of the 
bearing operating surfaces the following conditions 
have to be observed:
 1. The forces and speeds considered when 
calculating the bearing should correspond to the real 
operating conditions.
 2. Proper lubrication should be assured during the 
entire operating period.
 3. If the bearing carries a light load, its failure is 
generated by wear.
 4. Experience showed that the failure of many 
bearings was caused by other reasons than fatigue, 
such as: selection of an inadequate bearing type in 
a bearing assembly, improper operating conditions, 
lubrication contamination, etc.
Basic rating life
 The basic rating life of a single bearing or a group 
of apparently identical bearings operating under 
identical conditions, is the life corresponding to a 
reliability of 90%.
 Basic rating life is marked with L10 (millions of 
revolutions) or L10h (operating hours).
 L10 can be calculated using the equation:
 L10 = 
 , where:
 L10 - basic rating life, milions of revolutions,
 C - basic dynamic load rating, kN,
 P - equivalent dynamic bearing load, kN, 
 p - exponent of the life equation
 p= 3 - for ball bearings
 p = 10/3  - for roller bearings
 The equivalent dynamic bearing load, respectively 
the radial and axial load, acting simultaneously 
can be calculated using the following equations 
(applicable to ball and roller radial bearings):
Selection of bearing size

13
GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Pr = Fr , kN,            - for pure radial load
 Pr = XFr + YFa, kN, - for combined load
 For thrust ball bearings, the following equations 
can be used:
 Pa = Fa, kN, 
 - for pure axial load
 Pa = XFr + YFa, kN,   - for combined load
 where:
 Fr = the radial component of the load, kN
 Fa = the axial component of the load, kN
 In the texts preceding the bearing tables, for 
some groups of bearings there are given details 
for determining the equivalent load. Values of the 
coefficients X and Y can be found in tables.
 For bearings operating at constant speed, the 
basic rating life expressed in operating hours can be 
calculated using the equation:
 L10h= 
  or  L10h= 
 Where:
 n = rotational speed, r/min
 Values of the basic rating life L10 (milions of 
revolutions) as a function of the ratio C/P can be 
found in the table 2.1.
 Values of the basic rating life L10h (operating hours) 
as a function of the ratio C/P and speed n can be 
found in table 2.2 for ball bearings and table 2.3 for 
roller bearings.
 When determining the bearing size it is 
necessary to base the calculations on the rating life 
corresponding to the purpose of operation.
 Usually it depends on the machine type, service 
life and the requirements regarding operational 
safety.
 Approximate values of the service life for various 
classes of machines and equipments for  general 
purposes are given in table 2.4. 
 The basic rating life L10h of the bearings can be 
determined as a function of service life, using the life 
calculation chart on page 17. 
 The basic rating life of road and rail vehicle 
bearings, for axlebox bearings, is expressed as a 
function of the wheel diameter and covered distance 
(km), using the equation:
 L10s = 

 where:
 L10 - basic rating life, millions of revolutions
 L10s - service life distance, millions of kilometers
 D    - wheel diameter, metres
 Approximate values for the service life distance 
(kilometers covered), in case of light loaded cars and 
rail vehicles are given in table 2.5.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Example:

1. Determine the size of a deep groove ball bearing single row, 
considering the following conditions:

- Basic rating life L10h = 25000 operating hours

- Rotational speed n = 1000 rpm

- Radial load Fr = P = 5 kN

In the chart we find report: C/P = 11,6; C = 11,6xP = 11,6x5 = 
58 kN. In the catalogue on page 100, you can select bearing 6310 
type, with the following characteristics: Cr = 61,8 kN; nlim = 7000 
rpm.

2. What is the basic life of the bearing NU 210E, operating 
under radial load of 7,7 kN, at a rotational sped n = 750 rpm?

See page 172 in the calalogue and find for NU 210E type, the 
following values: Cr = 64,4 kN, nlim= 8000 rpm. From the chart, for 
a roller bearing operated at 750 rpm, and Cr/Pr=64,4/7,7=8,36 
result is a rating life L10h = 25000 hours.

 In case of bearings which do not rotate, but 
oscillates from a central position through an angle, 
as shown in fig. 1, basic rating life can be determined 
as follows:

 Where:
 L10osc = basic rating life, milions of cycles
    = oscillation amplitude (angle of maximum 
deviation from centre position), degrees
 If oscillation of amplitude is very small, it can be 
ignored for basic dynamic rating life calculation. It 
will be only a static evaluation.
Fig. 1
Fluctuating dynamic load and speeds
 In many cases, operation speed and magnitude of 
the load fluctuates. Therefore a mean dynamic load 
is to be calculated. 
Complete oscillation = 4  from point 0 to point 4. 
The load acting on the bearing can vary as shown in 
fig. 2-a and 2-b.
 In this case, the mean load can be determined 
using the equation:

 In case of oscillating movements with angle ,
as shown in fig. 7, equivalent mean load can be 
calculated with the equation:

 If the fluctuating load acts in a pure radial direction 
for radial bearings and in a pure axial direction for 
thrust bearings, the equivalent dynamic bearing load 
will be: 
 Pr = Fm.
 For combined loads, with radial load Fr and axial 
load Fa constant in direction and magnitude, the 
equivalent dynamic load can be calculated using the 
equation:
 Pr = X Fr + Y Fa, kN
Fig. 5
Fig. 6
Fig. 7
 In case of combined loads, with radial and axial 
loads changing in time, ratio Fr/Fa being constant, the 
equivalent dynamic load can be calculated by:
 Pm = X Frm + Y Fam, kN
 where:
 Pm - equivalent mean dynamic load, kN
 Frm - radial mean load, kN
 Fam - axial mean load, kN
 X,Y - factors of radial and axial load.
 If direction and magnitude of load changes in time 
and speeds fluctuates in time, the equivalent mean 
dynamic load will be calculated using the equation:

 where:
 Pm - equivalent mean dynamic load, kN 
 P1 - equivalent dynamic load for n1 revolutions, kN
 P2 - equivalent dynamic load for n2 revolutions, kN
 Pn - equivalent dynamic load for nn revolutions, kN
 n1 - number of revolutions for load P1

 n - number of revolutions (n=n1+n2+ ... nn)
 p - exponent: -  3  for ball bearings,
                        - 10/3  for roller bearings
Basic dynamic load of a bearing group
 If heavy radial loads must be carried, it is required 
a bearing group of the same type, mounted close 
together, especially in case of ball and roller bearings.
In order to take over the load uniformly, these bearings 
should be mounted with equal diameter deviations 
and also radial clearances. These deviations must be 
kept below half of the admitted tolerance class.
 Basic dynamic load for a bearing group, as a 
function of the basic load of the single bearing, can 
be calculated using the equation:
 Cri = Crin,
 where:
 Cri - basic dynamic load of the bearing group, kN
 Cr - basic dynamic load of the single bearing,

Adjusted rating life
 Basic rating life L10 is often satisfactory for 
bearing performances. This life means a reliability 
of 90% for standard material and modern and 
usual manufacturing technologies, as well as for 
conventional operating conditions.
 For a reliability over 90%, international standards 
recommends steels elaborated in better conditions, 
high level manufacturing technologies and specific 
operating conditions. In this case adjusted rated life 
can be calculated as follows:
 Lna = a1 a2 a3 L10 or Lna = a1 a2 a3  
 where:
 Lna – adjusted rating life, milions of revolutions
 a1 - life adjustement factor considering reliability
 a2 - life adjustement factor considering the 
material and manufacturing conditions
 a3 - life adjustement factor considering the 
operating conditions.
 In case of life adjustement factors a1, a2, a3 
greater than 1, when calculating adjusted rating 
life, prudence is recommended, because knowledge 
about bearings manufacture and operating conditions 
(shaft bending, housing stiffness, lubrication, 
temperature influence, etc.).
 Values of the life adjustment factor a1 for 
reliabilities over 90% are given in table 2.7.

Life adjustment factor a2 for material
 Life adjustement factor a2 takes into account the 
material properties, heat treatment of the steel and 
manufacturing technologies. For URB bearings, a2=1 
is recommended.
Life adjustment factor a23 for operating 
conditions
 The maximum life of a bearing can be reached 
in case of hydrodynamical lubrication, namely where 
is no direct contact between rolling elements and 
raceways due to the lubricant film. In this field, many 
studies have been done by world leading bearing 
manufacturers. These studies showed that there is 
a relationship between life adjustment factor a2 for 
material and life adjustment factor a3 for operating 
conditions. Preferably these factors should be 
unified, obtaining factor a23. In this case, adjusted 
rating life would be:
  Lna = a1a23L10

 These values of a23 factor depends on the lubricant 
used, namely on the ratio between the oil viscosity

 The value of viscosity  , as a function of the mean 
bearing diameter and operating speed, are given in 
diagram fig. 8.
 Kinematic viscosity  at the temperature of +400C 
can be determined from diagram fig. 9, in accordance 
with ISO, if the bearing operating temperature is 
known.
 In case of grease lubrication, calculation should be 
done considering the basic oil viscosity and the value 
of the life adjustment factor a23 will be smaller than 1.

Example of oil kinematic viscosity calculation for bearing 
lubrication:

The bearing 6212 operates at a speed of 3500 rpm and a 
temperature of +700 C.

Mean diameter wil be:

Dm= 0,5(d+D)=0,5(60+110) = 85 mm

From the diagram fig. 9, at a temperature of +700 C, for a 
viscosity  =8 mm/s2, the viscosity at +400 C is 20 mm/s2 (Cst).

In this case should be selected an oil in accordance with ISO 
VG 22 with kinematic viscosity limits: 
 = 19,8 mm/s2 (cSt) and 
 =24,2 mm/s2 (cSt).
 In case of bearing operating at temperatures 
higher than +1500C, an adjustment factor ft for 
temperature should be added to the life adjustment 
factor a23. Adjusted rating life will be:
  Lna = a1 a23 ft L10
 Values for the life adjustment factor ft for 
temperature are given in table 2.9.

Static load
 When the bearing is stationary or rotates at slow 
movements or very low speeds (lower than 10 rpm), 
basic static load is not determined by the material 
fatigue but by permanent deformation caused at the 
rolling element/raceway contact.
 It is also the case of rotating bearings, when they 
have to sustain heavy shock loads which act during a 
fraction of their revolution.
 Generally, the value of the load may increase up to 
the value of the basic static load C0, without altering 
the bearing operating properties.
Equivalent static load
 Combined static load (radial and axial load acting 
simultaneosly on bearing) must be converted into an 
equivalent static bearing load. This is defined as the 
load (radial for radial bearings and axial for thrust 
bearings) which is applied, and would cause the 
22

23
GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS

same permanent deformation in the bearing as the 
real load operating over it.
 Equivalent static load is obtained from the general 
equation:
 P0 = X0 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN,
where:
 P0 - equivalent bearing static load, kN,
 Fr - radial component of the heaviest static load, kN,
 Fa - axial component of the heaviest static load, kN,
 X0 - radial load factor of the bearing,
 Y0 - axial load factor of the bearing.
 Data needed to calculate equivalent static load 
can be found in text and in bearing tables.
 Requisite basic static load rating
 When determining bearing size on the basis of the 
static load, a static safety factor s0 is used.
 The requisite basic static load is calculated using 
the equation:
Cr0 = s0 Pr0 , kN
 where:
 Cr0 - basic static load rating, kN
 s0   - static safety factor, table 2.11
 Pr0  - equivalent static load, kN.
 At high temperatures, life of the material decreases 
and the static load carrying capacity of bearings is 
reduced.
 For high temperatures, basic static load is 
calculated using the equation: 
 Cr0 = f0t s0 Pr0 , kN
 The values of factor f0t depending on temperature 
is given in table 2.10.

Rotating bearings
 In case of fluctuating or oscillating loads and 
especially when heavy shock loads are acting during 
a fraction of revolution, it is necessary to check if the 
bearing has the proper static load carrying capacity.
Heavy shock loads, higher than the basic static

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
bearing load, produce permanent deformations not 
uniformly distributed on raceway, which influence 
negatively bearing running.
 Generally, heavy shock loads cannot be exactly 
calculated and in certain cases they produce 
deformations of bearing housing and consequently 
an unfavorable load distribution in bearing.
 When a bearing rotates under maximum load, 
raceway becomes uniformly deformed on all its outer 
surface without any imprint.
 For various operating conditions, maximum load 
acting upon the bearing is calculated with static 
safety factor s0, depending on the vibrations and 
shock loads.
 The values of static safety factor are given in table 
2.12.

 For bearing with a known equivalent static load, 
static safety factor s0 is necessary to be checked 
using the equation:

 If the value of s0 is less than recommended in 
table 2.12, then a bearing with a higher basic static 
load carrying capacity should be selected.
Basic static load for a group of bearings
 Where more bearings of the same type are 
mounted close toghether to take over a static load, 
the load magnitude supported by these bearings will 
be calculated from:
 C0ri = C0r i,
 where:
 C0ri - basic static load of the bearing group
 C0r - basic static load of the single bearing 
(catalogue)
 i - number of bearings.

Bearing tolerances
 Bearing tolerances have been internationally 
standardized in accordance with ISO 492, ISO 199, 
ISO 582, ISO 1132.
 Bearings are generally manufactured to the 
tolerance class P0. At request, they can also be 
manufactured to the tolerance classes P6, P6x, 
P5, P4 and P2. These bearings are used for special 
applications, such as very accurate shaft guidance or 
very high speeds.
 The values of the limit deviations for these 
tolerance classes are given for:
 -the overall dimensions of:
-deep groove ball bearings, angular contact 
ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings, 
spherical roller bearings, cylindrical roller 
bearings, tapered roller bearings,
-tapered roller bearing with metric (mm) 
and inch dimensions,
-tapered bore bearings,

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Radial and axial loads in bearing units can be 
transmitted by locating and non-locating bearings.
 A locating bearing is generally used for medium and 
large - sized shafts that can reach high temperatures 
during operation. It has to support radially the shaft 
assembly and to locate it axially in both directions.
 A non-locating bearing supports the shaft 
assembly only radially. It also allows axial 
displacement in relation to the housing to take place 
so that additional axial loading is avoided.
  Axial displacement can take place either in the 
housing bore seating or in the bearing itself.
 In case the shaft is supported by more than two 
bearings, only one of them will be a locating bearing 
and it will be the one with the lightest radial load.
 In case of small-sized shafts, two non-locating 
bearings with limited displacement can be used. 
Each of them can accommodate axial loads in a 
single direction, having thus mutual location.
 Fig. 4.1 shows a few of the most representative 
applications of locating and non-locating bearings, 
as follows:
 a) The locating bearing is a single row deep groove 
ball bearing and the non-locating one is a cylindrical 
roller bearing with both rings tightly fitted on the 
shaft and into the housing, respectively.
 b) Both bearings are supported by spherical roller 
bearings. The locating bearing is tightly fitted both 
on the shaft and into the housing. The non-locating 
bearing has the outer ring mounted with clearance 
into the housing and thus allows axial displacement 
in both directions.
 c) The locating bearing consists of a cylindrical 
roller bearing, NUP type and the non-locating bearing 
consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU type.
 d) The locating bearings consist of a cylindrical 
roller bearing. NU type which takes over radial loads 
and of a four- point contact ball bearing (unloaded on 
the outside). The non-locating bearing consists of a 
cylindrical roller bearing, NU type. 
 e) The locating bearings consists of a cylindrical

bearing, NA type which takes over radial loads and 
of a single row deep groove ball bearing (unloaded 
on the outside) which takes over axial loads in both 
directions. The non-locating bearing consists of a 
needle roller bearing, NA type.
 g) The shaft bearings can also be X-type 
arrangement of two tapered roller bearings which 
can be considered mutual located bearing.
Recommendation for bearing fit selection
 Three main criteria have to be considered when 
selecting the bearing fit:  
 a) Firm location and uniform support of bearings;
 b) Simply mounting and dismounting;
 c) Axial displacement of non-locating bearing.

 The most common location is assured by tight fit.
 A high tightening is recommended for roller 
bearings and large-sized bearings in comparison to 
ball bearings of the same size.
 In case of a tight fit, the inner ring is supported by 
the entire shaft contact surface, thus bearing is used 
at full load carrying capacity.
 The tolerance classes given in table 4.1 and 4.3 
are available for bearing fits which do not exceed 
+120° during operation.
 As a general rule, selection of the tolerance class 
“H” is recommended for bearings of separable 
design and tolerance class “J” for bearings of non-
separable design.
 When selecting a fit, the load of rotating ring has 
to consider, namely:
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is stationary, 
the outer ring should be mounted with clearance fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is stationary, 
the outer ring should be mounted with a tight fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the direction of load is 
not determined, both rings should be mounted with 
a tight fit.
 In table 4.1, there are given recommendations to 
select the tolerance class for shaft as function of: 
bearing type, loading and shaft diameter. In table 
4.3, one can find recommendations to select the 
tolerance class for housing,
 Figure 4.2 shows schematically the tolerance 
classes for shaft and housing and their influence over 
fit type i.e. clearance, transition or tight fit for housing 
and transition fit or tight fit for shaft, respectively.
 In tables 4.2 and 4.4, the deviations of the shaft 
diameter (4.2) and of the housing diameter (4.4) are 
given, considering the following:
- upper and lower limits
- theoretical minimum and maximum values of

- the minimum and maximum values of the probable 
tightening or clearance in the fit (99% of fits are

 The tolerances of bore diameter dmp and outside 
diameter Dmp are valid for all metric sized bearings, 
except tapered roller bearings with d<30 mm and 
D<150 mm and thrust ball bearings with D≤150 
mm, (see table 3.15 and 3.16 on page 34 and table

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Bearing axial location
 Axial location of the bearing is necessary for 
a proper guiding of bearing in an assembly under 
operation.
 A tight fit is inadequate for the axial location of 
bearing. In case of locating bearings, axial location 
for both rings is generally needed. Some important 
solutions of bearing axial location, on shaft or into the 
housing are shown in Fig. 4.4.
 In case of bearings with light axial loads, bearings 
can be located using a lock nut and a lock washer 
(a), an end plate fastened by a screw at the shaft end 
(b) and, for bearings carrying light axial loads, by lock 
rings mounted in shaft and housing grooves (c).
 Bearing with NR design, with groove and snap ring 
on the outer ring, can be easily located by the lock 
ring (d). Tapered roller bearings can be located by 
supporting the inner ring on the shaft shoulder and 
the outer ring with a threaded ring and a safety plate 
fastened by a screw (e).
 Tapered bore bearings can be mounted and axially 
located by adapter or withdrawal sleeves (f,g).
 The axial load carrying capacity of the bearings 
mounted with adapter or withdrawal sleeves is 
governed by the friction between shaft and sleeve (g).
 To locate radial bearings, where axial adjustment 
of the shaft is required, setting washers (i) or spacer 
rings (i) are used between the outer rings, the width 
of the spacer ring being experimentally determined, 
during mounting.
Fig. 4.4
Bearing sealing
 Seals are used in most of bearing arrangements 
and they must ensure the conditions of a proper 
operation. 
 For such a purpose, they have to prevent solid 
contaminants (dust, hard particles, water, aggressive 
substances etc) from penetrating into the bearing 
and at the same time to retain the lubricant in the 
bearing.
 Seals for rolling bearings can be classified 
considering some important criteria such as: design, 
operations, type of lubricant etc.
 Considering their design and operation, seals can 
be: stationary seals between the stationary bearing 
elements (housing and cover), rotary seals, between 
the rotating bearing elements and they also can be 
rubbing seals or non-rubbing seals, which are used 
in special applications (surrounding conditions and 
loading stress).

 Rotary non-rubbing seals are often used due to 
their simple design. They are particularly used at 
high speeds or temperature, both for grease and oil, 
and have practically no friction and do not wear.
 In case of bearing grease lubrication, bearing 
operating temperature must be lower with 20°C 
than the dropping point of the grease (melting 
temperature).
 The main constructive types of rotary non-
rubbing seals have narrow gaps, labyrinths and their 
combinations are shown in fig 4.5 a-c.
 Gap seals represent the simplest constructive 
solution for a rotary non-rubbing seal which have 
to retain grease in the bearing housing. The efficacy 
of sealing depends on the gap length (L) and the 
clearance between shaft and housing. It can be 
improved by providing one or more circular grooves 
on the shaft or in the housing, which are to be filled 
with grease (b). In case of oil lubrication, the grooves 
on the shaft must be helical (c) and their direction 
must be the same with the direction on the shaft 
rotary movement.
 Experiments proved that most favorable clearance 
is obtained between the limits of the fit A11/h10, 
geometrical deviations should be IT6 and gap 
surface roughness Ra=12,6 µm.
 Labyrinth seals are used at high peripheral speeds, 
in impure surroundings.
 They are shows in fig. 4.6 a-d.
 The labyrinths are spaces where periodically 
water-in-soluble grease (e.g. Lithium or Calcium 
base grease) is to be supplied.
 The tongues of the labyrinth seals can be 
radially (a), axially (b) arranged or they can have 
inclined passages.
 Details of an axial labyrinth design are given in fig. 
4.6 d and values of axial clearance and length L are 
given in table 4.8.
 In case of rotary rubbing seals there is a direct 
contact between elastic seal element and the 
rotating element. They are shown in fig. 4.8.
 When selecting the proper rotary rubbing seal, the 
following factors have to be considered: material and 
its elasticity (felt, rubber, plastics, leather, graphite, 
asbestos etc.); resistance at various temperatures, 
maximum peripheral speeds on sealing surface; 
sealing direction etc.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 These systems have sealing properties higher 
than those corresponding to non-rubbing seals. 
In case of grease lubrication at peripheral speeds 
higher than 4m/s and temperatures over +100°C, 
felt ring seals (a) are frequently used because of their 
simple design and cheapness.
 Before mounting, felt rings are impregnated during 
one hour with a mixture of mineral oil (66%) and 
paraffin (34%), at a temperature of +70...+80°C so 
that sealing properties are improved as the friction is 
reduced.
 At higher temperatures and peripheral speeds 
over 12 m/s, surface roughness is Ra=1,6 µm and 
the space between the ends of the seal should be 
filled with grease. Two felt rings can be used for 
sealing.
 Rubbing seals with a spring incorporated are 
preferably to be used in case of oil lubricated 
bearings which are operated under peripheral 
speeds of 5-10 m/s, temperatures between -40°C 
and +20°C. Their efficacy depends on the material 
and operating surroundings.
 In most cases, rubbing seals with a spring 
incorporated are made of synthetic rubber and have 
a metallic hardering fixture.
 Inclined  sealing surfaces are recommended to be 
ground Ra=0,8 µm and hardened at 45 HRC, when 
operating at peripheral speeds over 8 m/s. Lubricant 
outflow can be stopped by mounting the rubbing 
seal with incorporated spring with edge inwards (c) 
Fig. 4.7
Fig. 4.8
or outwards (d) if sealing has to prevent dust or other 
impurities from penetrating into the bearing.
 Double sealing with these rubbing seals can also 
be used.
 V-ring seal is used to prevent dust or contaminants 
from penetrating into the bearing with best results 
both in case of grease or oil lubrication. The elastic 
rubber lip of the V-ring seal is notched on the plane 
sealing surface, drawing the fluids in centrifugal 
motion. V-ring seals are used at temperatures of 
-40°C,,,+100°C roughness of sealing surface being 
Ra=1,5 – 3 µm. Generally, at peripheral speeds up 
to 15 m/s, the V-ring seal operates as a rubbing seal 
(seal lip reaches sealing surface), and at peripheral 
speeds over 15 m/s the seal lip will lift from the

sealing surface, operating as a centrifugal sealing.
 V-ring seals can also be used in case of angular 
misalignment of the shaft (2°C... 3°C) as they are 
made of high quality, elastic rubber, easy to be 
mounted.
 The efficacy of sealing depends on the fact that 
the body ring acts as a flinger for dirt and fluids. 
Therefore, with grease lubrication the seal is 
generally arranged outside the housing and with oil 
lubrication it is placed inside the housing.
 Pressed sheet washers provide simple, inexpensive 
and space-saving sealing especially for grease 
lubricated deep groove ball bearings. The washers 
are clamped against either the outer ring or the inner 
ring and exert a resilient pressure axially against 
the rubbing ring. In case of usual applications, the 
types of seals mentioned above or their combinations 
shown in fig. 4.9 are used, some of them becoming 
standard  seals for rolling bearings (e.g. labyrinths, 
felt rings, V-rings etc). Thus, better sealing can be 
obtained if felt ring (a) or V-ring (b) rubbing seals are 
combined with radial or axial labyrinth non-rubbing 
seals.
 Special seals are used in case of unusual 
surroundings and loading conditions (e.g. rolling 
mills, helm of ocean-vessels, main shaft of grinding 
machines etc).
 Sealed bearings of the type 2RS (2RSR) (a) or 
shielded bearings of the type 2Z (2ZR) (b) shown 
in fig. 4.10 a.b. provide simple and inexpensive 
sealing, with upper operating results. These rolling 
bearings are delivered ready greased, provision for 
relubrication and maintenance are not needed. They 
are used in case of bearings with small free space 
where other seals cannot be used.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Safe operating and long rating life of bearings 
depend on the lubricant type and quality and on the 
lubrication method. Bearing lubrication in used for 
certain purposes, such as:
 - to reduce friction between rolling elements and 
raceway, rolling elements and cage
 - to reduce friction between rolling elements 
and raceway, rolling elements and cage, cage and 
guiding ribs of rings during operation;
 - to ensure anticorrosive protection of bearings;
 - to reduce noise in bearing within certain limits;
 - to distribute heat uniformly in contact areas and 
to remove it outside through lubricant circulation.
Lubricants for bearings lubrication should satisfy the 
following conditions:
 - they should have physical and chemical stability;
 - foreign mechanical substances (abrasive, metallic 
substances etc.) are not admitted in lubricant;
 - they should have a minimal coefficient of friction;
 - to be non-corrosive;
 - good unctuosity (lubricating capacity).
There are two categories of lubricants used for 
bearing lubrication:
 - fluid lubricants (oils);
 - plastic lubricants (greases).
 Table 5.1 shows comparison between fluid and 
plastic lubricants.
 Although fluid lubricants have better characteristics 
than plastic lubricants, they cannot be used in all 
cases because of sealing difficulties.
Selection of lubricants
 When selecting lubricants, much care is needed 
and all operating conditions and lubricant properties 
Bearing lubrication
should be considered.
 No lubrication system can be considered universal.
The most important criteria when selecting a 
lubricant have to be as follows:
 - size of bearing
 - speed
 - load
 - bearing operating temperature
 These characteristic act upon lubricant viscosity 
as follows:
 - the higher the bearing size, value of load and 
temperature, the higher the viscosity
 - bearing speed acts by product 
, as show 
in table 5.2.
Grease lubrication
 Grease can be used to lubricate rolling bearings 
only when product 
 ≤ 500x103 and it offers 
the following advantages: 
 - bearing speed acts by product Dm n, as show 
in table 5.2.
 - it is more easily retained in the bearing;
 - it assures anti-corrosive protection to bearing 
as it is water-resistant;
 - low expenses for sealing.
 The grease quantity to be supplied shouldn’t be 
excessive, otherwise rotation is bracket, friction 
increases and also operating temperature without 
extending the bearing rating life.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The quantity of grease that is to be inserted in 
bearing seating should be as follows, considering the 
free space inside the housing:
 -1/2... 3/4 of the free space in the housing, in 
case of normal speeds;
 -1/3 of the free space in the housing, in case of 
high speeds and speed limit;
 - whole housing freespace should be free, in case 
of low speeds and product  
 < 10x103.
 The quantity of grease can be calculated as a 
function of bearing bore diameter using the equation:
G = K d2,5 , g.
where:
 K= 1/900 - for ball bearings
 K= 1/350 - for roller bearings 
 d = bore diameter, mm
 Relubrication intervals in most cases can be 
experimentally determined and depend on:
 - bearing type
 - bearing size
 - operating temperature
 - grease properties
 Grease service life and rubricating interval can be 
calculated from:
where:
 Tur = service life or rubricating interval, in operating 
hours
 k0 = coefficient  depending on the bearing type, 
table 5.3
 n = speed, r/min 
 d = bore diameter, mm
 f1 = temperature factor, table 5.4 
 f2 = factor depending on the operating conditions, 
table 5.5
 Low values are valid for deep groove ball bearings 
with shields, 2Z type, or with seals, 2RS type, series 
60, 62 and 63.
 Bearing relubrication interval can be also 
determined using the chart - fig. 5.1, as a function of 
bearing type, bore diameter and speed.
 Example:
 A bearing 6208-2RSR is operated under reduced 
load (it is not considered for calculation), at a speed 
n = 1500 r/min, at a temperature of +60 deg C, light 
operating conditions. What is the grease service life 
and relubrication interval?
 Grease service life will be:

 =32 893 hours.
 k0 = 25, from table 5.3 
 d = 40 mm 
 f1 = 1, from table 5.4 
 f2 = 1, from table 5.5
 Relubrication interval:

 =13 157 hours.
 k0 = 10, from table 5.3

 The grease quantity to be supplied can be 
determined using the equation:

 A more accurate calculation of grease service life, 
considering grease quality and bearing operating 
conditions (load, size, speed, temperature etc.) can 
be done using the equation:

 where:
 L = service life, operating hours
 a = exponent depending on the grease quality 
(a=5,8... 6,1)
 m1... m3 = exponents which take into account the 
following factors:
 m1 = 4,4 x 10-8 
,
 m2 = 2,5 (P/C - 0,05),
 m3 = (0,021 - 1,80 x 10-6 
) t,
 Dm = bearing mean diameter, mm
 n = bearing speeds, r/min,
 P = equivalent radial load, kN,
 C = basic dynamic load, kN,
 t = bearing operating temperature, °C
 When calculating the values of t, 
 and P/C, 
the following have to be considered:
 - when bearing operating temperature is lower 
than +50°C, then t = +50°C
 - when speed factor 
 < 125000, then 
 = 125000
 - when ratio P/C < 0,05, then P/C = 0,05
 Grease service life, as a function of operating 
temperature can be approximately determined using 
the diagram fig. 5.2.

Example 1
 A bearing 6210 operates under a load Pr = 5 kN, 
speed n = 3000 r/min at an operating temperature
t = 500C. What is the service life of the grease used 
for bearing lubrication?
 Cr = 35,1 kN, tables on page 100. bearing 6210
 L = 10a-(m1+m2+m3) = 106,1-2,273 = 6214 hours

 Pr/Cr = 5/35,1 = 0,143
 m1= 4,4 x 10-6 
 = 0,858
 m2 = 2,5 (Pr/Cr - 0,05) = 0,23
 m3 = (0,021 - 1,80 x 10-8 
) 65 = 1,119

Example 2

 For the same bearing and operating conditions as 
in Example 1, it is required to find the service life of 
the same grease at a temperature of t = 95°C.
 m3 = 1,66
 m1 + m2 + m3 = 2,794
 L = 106,1-2,794 = 103,306 = 1774 operating hours
 From the diagram fig. 5.2, we can find 
approximately the same value, respectively 6000 
operating hours at + 65°C and 170° operating hours 
at +95°C.

Oil lubrication
 Oil lubrication can be used in any operating 
condition, but this kind of lubrication is compulsory 
when the value of the product 
 from table 5.2 
is exceeded for grease, namely 
 >500 x 103 
and when high temperatures occur in bearing. Then, 
oil has to lubricate and to remove heat from bearing.
 Oils used for bearing lubrication can be:
- mineral oils, used up to a temperature of +150°C.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The basic designation consists of an identification 
of the type of bearing (figure or letter), the series 
designation, in accordance with ISO and the bore 
diameter identification.
 The designation of the bearing type and dimension 
series, for main standardized bearing types, is given 
in table 6.1.
 Bore diameter identification consist of one, two or 
more figures as follows:
- bore diameter
from 1 to 9 mm
- bore diameter
from 10 to 495 mm
 The purpose of designation is that of identification 
of bearings, so that bearings with the same 
designation to be interchangeable both dimensionally 
and operationally, no matter who the producers 
may be. Designation of URB rolling bearings are in

supplementary designations (prefixes and suffixes), 
as shown in chart fig. 6.1. 
- one figure, representing the 
bore diameter (e.g. 623, 608);
- two figures, as follows: 00 
for 10 mm, 01 for 12 mm, 02 
for 15 mm, 03 for 17 mm, 04 
and up to 99 for bore diameter 
from 20 to 495 mm. (bore 
diameter = bore diameter 
identification x 5, e.g. 6230, 
d=150 mm);
- is stated directly separated by 
a slash, the same applies to the 
values which are not perfect 
multiples of 5, or if they include 
a decimal point (e.g. 610/560, 
62/32, 62/1,5).
 Tapered roller bearings with inch dimensions listed 
in this catalogues make an exception from this rule.
Prefixes
 Prefixes are letter-identifications which indicate the 
material, other than steel for bearings or component 
parts of bearing. The prefix for material is separated 
by a horizontal line from the rest of designation.
Prefixes for materials
H    - heat-resisting steel (e.g. H - NUP 210)
M    - copper alloy (e.g. M - 6008)
S     - plastics, glass, ceramics etc. (e.g. S - 6204)

with increased basic load (e.g. A, C, E 

etc.), contact angle (e.g. A, B, C) and

others.
Group II 
- Modifications of external design, tapered 

bore, groove on outer ring etc. (e.g. 

30205A, 1210K, 6210NR, 6310-2RS)
Group III  - Modifications of cage design, material, 

guiding surfaces etc. (e.g. 6205TN, 

NU310MA)
Group IV - Modifications of normal design regarding 

tolerance classes, bearing radial or axial  

clearance, stability of dimensions at high 

temperatures, bearing matching etc. (e.g. 

6206P5, 6310P53, NU210SO, 7010CDB).

Mounting and dismounting
 Proper operation of rolling bearings is also 
determined by a proper selection of the solution of 
mounting and dismounting, considering the type 
and size of bearing, fit, adequate tools for these 
operations, performance etc.
 As being precision components, rolling bearings 
should be handled carefully when storing or 
mounting. Thus, the following conditions should be 
observed:
 - storing in their original package, on special 
shelves, in dry room, temperature of +18°C...+20°C, 
maximum moisture degree of 60%
 - handling bearings, while storing and mounting, 
should be carefully done so that original package to 
be protected and not to be deteriorated
 - bearings should be unpacked only when they are 
to be mounted
 They shouldn’t be washed if original package 
hasn’t been destroyed
 - as the adjoin parts of bearing are accurate, 
without burrs, chips or hits, special care should be 
taken.
Mounting of bearings with cylindrical bore
 Bearings with cylindrical bore which are to have 
tight fit on shaft on in housing respectively will be 
mounted by mechanical, thermic or hydraulic means.
 The pressing force should be transmitted only 
by the ring which is pressed on the shaft or into 
the housing bore. Transmission by rolling bearings 
should be avoided as they can get deformed and 
premature damage can occur.
 Special sleeves with one or two ribs, fig. 7.1, a and 
b are used when mounting small and medium-sized 
bearings, which are to be mounted with transition 
fit. In case of self-aligning ball bearings or spherical 
roller thrust bearings, a plate is mounted for a proper 
location of the outer rings, as shown in fig. 7.2.
 Mechanical or hydraulic presses are used as 
shown in fig. 7.3, in case of serial production so that 
force can be continuously and gradually applied.
Fig. 7.1

b
Fig. 7.2
 For the mounting of bearings with clearance fit into 
the housing or on the shaft, the ring with transition 
or tight fit should be mounted first, after which the 
shaft-bearing assembly will be mounted into the 
housing as shown in fig. 7.4, a and b.
 In case of dismountable bearings, rings can be 
mounted separately - fig. 7.5, even if a tight fit is 
required for both rings.
 The mounting of medium (d > 50 mm) and large-
sized bearings with tight fit, requires much greater 
pressing forces. That’s why in this case heating of 
bearings up to +80°C...+110°C should be used 
instead of pressing, excepting shielded bearings, 2Z 
(2ZR) type and sealed bearings, 2RS (2RSR) type.
 For the bearings heating, oil bath, electric range, 
heating device with thermic ring or induction heating 
device etc. can be used as shown in fig. 7.6, a-d.
The device with thermic ring - fig. 7.6 c consists of a 
split aluminum ring with three grips and cuts which

make it be elastic.
 Thermic ring bore diameter is equal to inner ring 
raceway diameter of dismountable bearings.
 The ring outside diameter can be calculated using 
the equation:

where:
 Dex = outside diameter of the thermic ring, mm
 d1 = diameter of the inner ring raceway, mm 
 d = bearing bore diameter, mm
 The mass of the thermic ring is approximately 
equal to the mass of the bearing inner ring.
 In case of large-sized cylindrical roller bearings, 
heating is done with induction devices. These 
devices consist of a coil inductor, thermal relays for 
temperature adjustment and timers. 380 V voltage 
and 50 - 60 Hz frequency inductors are used for 
bearings with bore diameter up to 200 mm. 
 For larger sized bearings, 20... 40 V voltage and 
50 - 60 Hz inductors are used.
 This device is schematically shown in fig. 7.6 d. 
Mounting of bearings with tapered bore
 Tapered bore bearings can be mounted directly 
on the shaft, on adapter sleeve or withdrawal 
sleeve. These bearings should always be mounted 
only with a tight fit. The tight fit can be done by an 
axial displacement of the bearing inner ring which

 The values of tightening are estimated by the 
values of the radial clearance reduction or of axial 
displacement. Axial displacement of the mounted 
bearings is measured by means of a limit gauge, as 
shown in fi g. 7.7, a and b. The thickness of the limit 
gauge can be calculated from:
 m = S - a
where:
 m = thickness of the limit gauge, mm
 S = distance initially measured, mm
 a = axial displacement, from table 7.1, mm

7.1 = 1,90 mm, m = 10 - 1,9 = 8,10 mm
 Small-sized bearings with tapered bore which are 
to be mounted directly on the shaft or with adapter 
or withdrawal sleeves can be axially displaced by 
means of a nut as shown in fig. 7.8, a, or by means 
of a special sleeve as in fig. 7.8 b, c.
 Medium-sized bearings can be axially displaced 
by means of a special nut as shown in fig. 7.9 and 
some screws. Then, the nut is to be dismounted and 
replaced with a nut for axial fastening.
Special hydraulic presses - fig. 7.11 are used to 
mount medium and large-sized bearings.
 To reduce the bearing displacing force in case 
of large-sized bearings, pressurized oil is to be 
introduced between the tapered surfaces of the shaft 
spindle, bearing and b, by means of oil pump - fig. 
7.10 or oil injector - fig. 7.12.
 One or more grooves, should be provided as shown 
in fig. 7.13, a and b so that oil can be distributed 
between the mounting surfaces.

Bearing dismounting
 When bearings with tapered bore are to 
be dismounted from the shaft or housing, the 
succession of operations is inversely done than in 
case of mounting.
 Thus, the assembly mounted with clearance fit or 
small tightening is to be dismounted first and then 
the parts mounted with greater tightening, as shown 
in fig. 7.14 and fi g. 7.15.
 To use mechanical or hydraulic instruments, when 
dismounting bearings, a special design of the shaft 
and housing is required, as shown in fig. 7.16, a-c: 
withdrawal grooves (a) and (b), threaded bores (c), 
grooves for oil distribution, fig. 7.13.
 Medium and small-sized bearings which are 
mounted with a tight fit are dismounted from the 
shaft by means of a soft steel or copper mandrel 
or by means of mechanical or hydraulic presses 
fig.7.17, a-c.
 To reduce the frictional force when dismounting 
large sized bearings which were mounted on shaft 
with tight fit, pressurized oil should be introduced, as 
in case of mounting - fig. 7.11.
 To dismount bearings with tapered bore which 
were mounted directly on the shaft or bearings which 
were mounted with withdrawal or adapter sleeves, 
the nut axially fastened should be first stripped. 
Then, dismounting is to be done by light hammering 
on the inner ring by means of a soft steel or copper 
mandrel, as shown in fi g. 7,18 a and b.
 In case of bearings mounted with withdrawal 
sleeves, a nut is to be screwed up to the threaded

Deep groove ball bearings
 Deep groove ball bearings are manufactured in a 
varied range, both of standard design and various 
constructive versions.
Deep groove ball bearings can take double direction 
radial and axial loads and also allow good operation 
at high speeds.
 For these reasons, thei can be widely used. 
Therefor, single row deep groove ball bearings are 
manufactured in many constructive versions as 
shown below.
 Besides deep groove ball bearings of basic design, 
bearings with UG design, with grooves on the outer 
ring and WL design, with grooves on both rings 
are also used for the purpose of mounting seals or 
shields on the bearings 2ZR, 2RSR or 2RS type, as 
shown in the bellow figure.

Sealed and shielded deep groove ball bearings
 URB manufactures two versions of sealed and 
shielded bearings, namely:
 - bearings RS and Z type, with recess on the inner 
ring for sealing or shielding.
 - bearings RSR and ZR type, when shielding and 
sealing respectively are done directly on the outside 
surface of the inner ring.
 In case of bearings with non-rubbing shields, there 
is a small interstice between the shield and the rib 
of the inner ring; in case of bearings with seals, the 
gasoline and oil resistant elastic rubber lip rubs on 
the groove on the inner ring side or directly on the 
outside surface.
 Bearings sealed and shielded on both sides 
manufactured in series are delivered filled with 
lithium base grease and used at temperatures 
between -30ºC and +110ºC, in accordance with 
the specifications in chapter Bearing lubrication. 
Bearings can also be greased with special greases, 
relubrication not being necessary. Washing or 
heating are not allowed before bearing mounting in 
the assembly.
 Bearings with shields have been designed first of 
all for cases when the inner ring rotates.
 When the outer ring rotates, the lubricant can flow 
out of the bearing at a certain speed. In such cases, 
we recommend you to consult our experts.
Deep groove ball bearings with the snap ring 
groove
 Deep groove ball bearings, with snap ring groove 
on the outer ring can be located in the housing with 
snap rings.
 Because of their simple and space saving 
mounting, these bearings simplify the assembly 
design. The groove for the snap ring and the snap 
rings are in accordance with ISO 464 and tables 7 
and 8 respectively.
Paired deep groove ball bearings
 If the basic load of a single bearing is inadequate 
or the shaft has to be axially located in both directions 
with a certain clearance, paired deep groove ball 
bearings are recommended to be used.
 These bearings can be delivered matched in 
pairs in three versions, as follows: DT (tandem 
arrangement), DB (back-to-back arrangement) or DF 
(face-to-face arrangement). They can be delivered 
with axial clearance or preloaded. The values of 
clearance or preload are given in table 2.
 The producer marks “V” on the bearing outside 
surface as shown in next figure, so that pired 
bearings to be correctly mounted.

83
GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The multiple speed limit of these bearings can be 
calculated multiplying the speed of the basic bearing 
by 0,8.
 Paired bearings are packed and delivered in the 
same box.
Dimensions
 The overall dimensions of deep groove ball 
bearings are in accordance with the stipulations of 
ISO 15.
Misalignments
 Deep groove ball bearings have limited abilities 
to compensate for bearing error of alignment. The 
permissible misalignment between the outer ring and 
the inner ring, which will not produce inadmissible 
high additional loads in the bearing, depends on 
the bearing size, operational radial clearance, inner 
bearing design and also on the magnitude of loads 
and moments acting upon the bearing.
 Because of the complex relationship of these 
influence factors, definite and universally valid values 
of permissible misalignment cannot be determined.
Considering the above mentioned factors, under 
normal operation conditions the permissible 
misalignments are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc, 
depending on the bearing series and load.
Tolerances
 Deep groove ball bearings are generally 
manufactured to the normal tolerance class P0.
 At request, they can also be manufactured to the 
tolerance classes P6, P5 or P4.
 The values of tolerances are given in chapter 
Bearing tolerances on page 26.
Radial and axial clearance
 Deep groove ball bearings are generally 
manufactured with normal radial clearance. At 
request, they can also be manufactured with radial 
clearance different from the normal one, according 
to ISO 5753. The values of radial clearance are given 
in table 1.
 Paired bearings can be manufactured with axial 
clearance (suffix A) or preloaded (suffix L).
Values for axial clearance and preload are given in 
table 2.
 If a certain axial clearance is prescribed, this has 
to be measured and marked on the bearing by “A”, 
followed by clearance actual value.

Cages
 Deep groove ball bearings are generally fitted with 
cages of pressed steel sheet.
 Cages of glass fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 are 
also suitable if the operating temperature doesn’t 
exceed +120ºC. They have reduced mass, low 
coefficient of friction and are noiseless in operation.  
Large-sized bearings are fitted with machined brass 
cages.
 Cage design and some technical data are given in 
table 3.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Bearing minimum radial load
 A minimum load must be applied on a deep groove 
ball bearing so that they can operate correctly, 
especially in case of operating under heavy loads.
 The forces of inertia which occur in bearing as 
well as the friction in lubricant influence negatively 
the operating conditions and can cause detrimental 
sliding movements between balls and raceways.
 Minimum radial load depends on the bearing 
size, speed and lubricant viscosity at operating 
temperature. It can be roughly calculated from the 
equation:
 Fr min = 0,01 Cr, (Cr = basic dynamic radial load).
Equivalent dynamic radial load
 Deep groove ball bearing can take also radial and 
axial combined loads.
 For deep groove ball bearings, single or paired in 
tandem arrangement DT, equivalent dynamic radial 
load can be calculated using the equation:
Pr = Fr , kN, when Fa/Fr <e
Pr = XFr+YFa, kN, when Fa/Fr>e
 The greater the axial load, the greater the contact 
angle of these bearings.
 Factor e, X and Y depend on the ratio f0Fa/C0r. 
 Factor f0 can be determined using the diagram in 
the bellow figure, as a function of dimension series 
and mean diameter (d+D)/2. Fa is the axial and C0r is 
the static basic load of the bearing.
 The values of factors e, X, Y which depend on the 
bearing clearance can be determined from table 4, 
coresponding to the values of the ratio f0Fa/C0r. The 
values in table 4 apply to bearings mounted with 
normal fit, i.e. shaft manufactured to tolerance class 
j5 or k5 and housing in J6, respectively.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 For bearings matched in DB or DT arrangement, 
equivalent dynamic radial load can be calculated 
using the equation:
Pr=Fr+Y1Fa, kN when Fa/Fe <e
Pr= 0,75Fr + Y2Fa, kN when F1/Fr>e.
 The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2, as functions of 
ratio Fa/C0r are given in table 5.

Equivalent static radial load
 For deep groove ball bearings, single or matched in 
tandem (DT), equivalent static load can be calculated 
using the equations:
P0 = Fr, kN, when Fa/Fr<0,8
P0 = 0,6Fr+0,5 Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr>0,8
For bearings matched in DB or DF arrangement, it 
can be calculated from
P0 = Fr+1,7 Fa, kN.
Axial load
 If deep groove ball bearings are pure axial loaded, 
the axial load should not exceed 0,5 C0r. In case of 
small-sized bearings and bearings of light series 
(diameter series 8, 9, 0 and 1), the axial load should 
not exceed 0,25 C0r.
 Heavy axial loads cause a significant decrease of 
bearing rating life. In such cases, we recommend you 
to consult our experts.
Abutment dimensions
 For a proper location of bearing rings on the shaft 
shoulder and housing, respectively, maximum shaft 
(housing) connection radius ru max should be less 
than minimum bearing mounting chamfer rs min.

 Deep groove ball bearing  
DIN 625
General
 Double Row Deep groove ball bearings feature 
higher load ratings when compared to single row 
bearings.
 This two row bearing gives a very rigid arrangement, 
but they are very sensitive to misalignments.
Tolerances
 URB Double Row Deep groove bearings are 
produced in normal tolerance class (PN) as standard.
Internal clearance
 URB Double Row Deep groove ball bearings are 
produced with normal internal clearance, (CN) as 
standard. Other internal clearance groups may be 
produced upon request.
Design variants, Cages
 URB Double Row Deep groove ball bearings 
have the latest design (suffix B) without filling slots.
 Thus they are able to support thrust loads equally 
well in both directions. These bearings are fitted with 
polyamide cages, (suffix TN) as standard.
 These bearing sizes are also available with 
pressed steel cages.
 But, it must be considered that some of these 
bearings may have filling slots which limit the ability 
to support thrust loads in the direction of these filling 
slots.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Self-aligning ball bearings have a common sphered 
raceway in the outer ring. This feature allows angular 
misalignment of the shaft relative to the housing. 
Therefore self-aligning ball bearings are particularly 
used in case of bearings where misalignment can 
occur from errors in mounting or from shaft bending.

Sealed self-aligning ball bearings
 Self-aligning ball bearings are also available in a 
sealed version with seals at both sides. The seals are 
made of gasoline, oil and wear-resistant synthetic 
rubber. Sealed bearings are delivered filled with a 
certain grease quantity. Sealed bearing operating 
temperatures are between -30°C and +80°C. 
Grease service life is much reduced if bearing 
 Double row self-aligning ball bearings are 
manufactured both with cylindrical bore and tapered 
bore (taper 1:12). Self-aligning bearings with tapered 
bore can be delivered, at request, with adapter 
sleeves.
operates at a temperature higher than +80°C (see 
page 63).
 Sealed bearings are greased for the entire 
operating period, relubrication not being necessary. 
Sealed bearings washing or heating before mounting 
in assembly is not allowed.
Self-aligning ball bearings with
extended inner ring
 Self-aligning ball bearings with extended inner 
ring of series 112 and 113 are used in applications 
where high accuracy is not necessary and generally, 
they can be mounted directly on rolled shafts. The 
bore manufactured to tolerance class J7 allows fast 
mounting and dismounting. The inner ring has a 
groove for bearing axial location which can be done 
by means of a screw or pin.
Dimensions
 Overall dimensions of self-aligning ball bearings 
are in accordance with ISO 15.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Misalignment
 Self-aligning ball bearings allow within certain 
limits an angular misalignment of the outer ring in 
relation to the inner ring, without detrimental effects 
in bearing unit.
 Approximate values for permissible misalignment, 
under normal operating conditions are given in 
table 1.
Tolerances and radial clearance
 Bearings of serial production are manufactured 
to normal tolerance class and with normal radial 
clearance. Tapered bore bearings of serial production 
are also manufactured with radial clearance C3.
 Self-aligning ball bearings with extended inner 
ring are manufactured with radial clearance C2 and 
normal clearance.
 At request, these bearings can also be 
manufactured to other tolerance classes and with 
smaller or larger radial clearance.
 The bore of self-aligning ball bearings with 
extended inner ring is manufactured to tolerance 
class J7.
 Bearing tolerances are given on page 27 and the 
values of radial clearance are given in tables 2 and 3.

when Fa/Fr ≤e,
 Pr = 0,65 Fr + Y2 Fa, kN  
when Fa/Fr >e,
 The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2 which depend on 
bearings are given in bearing tables.
Equivalent static radial load
 P0r = Fr + Y0 Fa, kN
 The values of the factor Y0 which depends on 
bearing are given in bearing tables.
Axial load on bearings with adapter sleeves
 If self-aligning ball bearings are mounted with 
adapter sleeves on smooth shafts, without side 
location, their axial carrying capacity depends on the 
friction between the sleeve bore and shaft.
 Permissible axial load can be precisely enough 
determined using the equation:
Fa max = 3 B d,
where:
Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, N
B - bearing width, mm
d - bearing bore diameter, mm
Cages
 Self-aligning ball bearings are generally fitted 
with presses cages of sheet. At special request, 
when bearings operate under fluctuating loads, at 
high speeds and where large sizes are required, 
machined brass cages are recommended to be used. 
Glass fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages are also 
suitable if the operating temperatures do not exceed 
+120°C. They have low mass, a low coefficient of 
friction and are noiseless while running.
 Cage design and technical data are given in 
table 4.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Special characteristics
 In case of some dimensions of self-aligning 
ball bearings series 12 and 13, the balls protrude 
somewhat from the bearing, as shown in the adjacent 
design and table. This should be considered both by 
designer and user.
Abutment dimensions
 For a proper location of bearing rings on the 
shaft shoulder and housing shoulder respectively, 
maximum connection radius ru max. of shaft (housing) 
should be less than minimum mounting chamfer 
rs min of bearing.
 Shoulder height should also be properly sized in 
case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
 In case of self-aligning ball bearings with tapered 
bore which are mounted directly on a tapered shaft 
or with an adapter sleeve, proper tightening and 
minimum radial clearance of 10-20 µm  should be 
assured for normal clearance and of 20-55 µm for 
clearance C3, depending on bearing size and series. 
The values of the connection radius and support 
shoulder height are given in table 6 and mounting 
dimensions for bearings mounted with adapter 
sleeves are given in table 7.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Single row angular contact bearings are 
manufactured in various constructive versions, with 
various contact angles, depending on the application. 
Bearings series 72B and 73B for general applications 
have a contact angle a = 40°. Bearings series 718, 
719, 70 and 72 generally used for tool-holders, have 
phenol resins (textolite) cages or machined brass 
cages. Those with bore diameters up to d = 100 mm 
are manufactured to tolerance classes P5, P4 and 
P2 and have a contact angle of 15°(C) and 25°(A) 
respectively.

 Single row angular contact ball bearings can take 
only one direction axial loads. When being radially 
loaded, in bearing occurs an axially acting load which 
has to be compensated.
 For this reason, a bearing or paired bearings are 
mounted on each shaft end.
 Single row angular contact ball bearings with B 
suffix have a contact angle a= 40° and are suitable 
in case of heavy loads.
 These bearings are not dismountable and their 
use at relatively high speeds is allowed.
 Pair mounting of bearings as shown in figures on 
page 133 is used when the load carrying capacity of 
a single bearing is inadequate (tandem arrangement), 
respectively when axial loads have to be taken in 
both directions (DB or DF arrangements).
 In case of DT tandem arrangement, the contact 
lines are in parallel. Radial and axial loads are 
uniformly distributed on both bearings. The bearing 
pair can take axial loads in only one direction. 
Therefore, a third bearing should take axial loads in 
the opposite direction.
 DB arrangement is considered to be a relatively 
stiff arrangement and can also take tilting moments.
 The contact lines of DF arrangement converge 
129

124
GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
towards the bearing axis and form letter “X”. Axial 
loads are taken in the same way as in case of DB 
arrangement, but the arrangement is not so stiff and 
it is less suitable for taking tilting moments.
Universal design
 Single row angular contact ball bearings of 
universal design are suitable for DB, DF and DT 
arrangements.
 Bearings of universal design are manufactured 
to more accurate tolerance classes and can be 
matched if the mounting conditions UA, UO and UL 
are observed.
 The values of clearance or preload are obtained 
when the shaft is manufactured to tolerance class J5 
and the housing bore to tolerance class J6.
Dimensions
 Main dimensions of bearings given in tables are in 
accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
 In case of single row angular contact ball bearings 
the conditions regarding the permissible error of 
Contact angle
 In case of single row angular contact ball bearings, 
the efforts between rings and rolling elements 
(contact points of rolling elements / outer or inner 
ring) are transmitted at an angle a (<90°) to a plane 
perpendicular to the bearing axis.
alignment of the outer ring relative to the inner ring 
are as complex as for single row deep groove ball 
bearings.
 When the bearings are paired in DB arrangement, 
angular misalignments of the outer ring in relation to 
the inner ring can only be accommodated between 
the balls and raceways by force, leading to a 
reduction in bearing life.
Tolerances
 Single row angular contact ball bearings of series 
72B and 73B, with a contact angle a= 40° (B) are 
generally manufactured to the normal tolerance 
class.
 At request, they also can be manufactured to 
normal tolerance classes P6 and P5.
 The deviations of bore diameter, outside diameter 
and width of high accuracy single row angular 
contact ball bearings of universal design (UL) are 
given in table 1.
 In case of single row angular contact ball 
bearings manufactured and delivered in sets of 2, 
3 or 4 bearings, outside and bore diameter should 
be chosen considering the mean tolerance values, 
which are given on the package.
 The value of this angle depends on the magnitude 
of the raceway radius, rolling element diameter and 
radial clearance in bearing, when the curvature 
centres of the raceway in the outer or in the inner 
ring are in the same plane.

Axial clearance - preload
 Axial clearance or preload can be obtained only 
when single row angular contact ball bearings 
is mounted in the assembly and depends on the 
location of the second bearing which assures the 
shaft axial guiding.
 Single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B, paired mounted in DB and DF 
arrangements are manufactured with normal axial 
clearance CB, smaller than normal, CA, larger than 
normal, CC, or with light preload, GA, moderate 
preload GB, or heavy preload, GC, according to the 
values given in table 2.
 High accuracy single row angular contact ball 
bearings series 70C, 70A and 72A, with a contact 
angle a = 15° (C) and a = 25° (A), which are generally 
used for grinding stone holders, paired mounted in 
DB and DF arrangement, are manufactured with an 
initial preload. It can be: light (L), moderate (M), heavy 
(S). The values of these preloads are given in table 3.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Designs of single row angular contact ball 
bearings with clearance or initial preload are given in 
the figures below: 
Cages
 Single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B are generally fitted with pressed sheet 
cages.
 At special request (high speeds, large sizes), 
bearing series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A are fitted 
with machined brass cages. Cages of glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide 6.6 are also used with good 
results if operating temperature doesn’t exceed 
+120°C.
 Cages design and some technical data are given 
in table 4.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Equivalent dynamic radial load
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B, single and in tandem arrangement the 
following equations are used:
 Pr = Fr , kN, 

when Fa/Fr < 1,14,
 Pr = 0,35 Fr + 0,57 Fa , kN,  when Fa/Fr > 1,14
 For bearings in DB or DF arrangement
 Pr = Fr + 0,65 Fa , kN  
when Fa/Fr < 1,14
 Pr = 0,57 Fr + 0,93 Fa , kN,  when Fa/Fr > 1,14
 In case of paired bearings, Fr and Fa are the loads 
acting upon the bearings pair.
 As the load is transmitted from one raceway to the 
other under a certain angle to the bearings axis, the 
actual load will cause an axial load. This has to be 
considered when calculating the equivalent dynamic 
load, in case of two single bearings or tandem 
arrangements. The equations needed for calculation 
are given in table 5, for various arrangements and 
loading versions.
 These equations are available for bearings 
mounted without clearance and without preload 
(clearance equal to zero).
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
70C and 72C with a contact angle a = 15°(C), single 
or in DT arrangement, the following equations are 
available:
 Pr = Fr , kN, 

for Fa/Fr < e,
 Pr = 0,44 Fr + Y Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr > e
 The values of factor Y depend on the values of the 
ratio f0iFa/C0r and are given in table 6. Factor f0 can 
be found in diagram in page 140 as a function of 
dimensions series and bearing mean diameter. “i” 
represents the number of bearings or bearings pairs 
in a bearing join.

 For bearings in DB and DF arrangements, the 
following equations are available:
 Pr = Fr + Y1 Fa, kN,  
for Fa/Fr < e,
 Pr = 0,72 Fr + Y2 Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr > e
 The values of factors Y1 and Y2 depend on the ratio 
f0iFa/C0r and are given in table 6 (f0 from diagram 
below).

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
70A and 72A, with a contact angle a= 25°, single or in 
DT arrangement, the following equation are available:
 Pr = Fr , kN, 

for Fa/Fr < 0,68
 Pr = 0,41 Fr + 0,87 Fa , kN,  for Fa/Fr > 0,68
 For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the 
following equations are available:
 Pr = Fr + Y1 Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr < e
 Pr = 0,72 Fr + Y2 Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr > e
 Values for Y1 and Y2 are given in table 6.
Equivalent static load
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B with a contact angle a = 40°, single and 
in DT arrangement, the following equation is available:
 P0r = 0,6 Fr + 0,26 Fa , kN
 If P0r < F then we consider P0 = Fr
 For bearings in DB and DT arrangement, the 
following equation is available:
 P0r = Fr + 0,52 Fa , kN
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
70C and 72C, with a contact angle a = 15°, single and 
in DT arrangement, the following equation is available:
P0r = 0,5 Fr + 0,46 Fa , kN
 For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the 
following equation is available:
 P0r = 0,5 Fr + 0,92 Fa , kN
 For single row angular contact ball bearings series 
70A and 72A with a contact angle a = 25°, single and 
in DT arrangement, the following equation is available:
 P0r = 0,5 Fr + 0,38 Fa , kN
 For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the 
following equation in available:
 P0r = Fr + 0,76 Fa , kN
 Two “V” scratches are marked on the outside surface 
where the runout is maximum, i.e. where the outer ring 
thickness is maximum, so that the bearings of a set 
can be mounted in the manufacturing order. The place 
of maximum runout is marked on the chamfer between 
the inner ring bore and side face. Thus, the possible fit 
ovalnesses on the shaft can be compensated.
 Every set is delivered as an unit, separately packed. 
In each unit, bearings are singly packed.
 If distance rings are necessary to be mounted 
between bearings, they have not to be adjusted 
when being mounted. There is only one condition to 
be observed: the inner distance ring width should be 
equal to that of the outer ring, the side faces being 
parallel to each other. This can be easily done if both 
distance rings are simultaneously ground on a grinding 
and lapping machine. If bearings are mounted with 
distance rings, the mounting is also done observing 
the “V” marked as mentioned above. The cone vertex 
should be on the ring side oposite to that one on which 
the load acts (see next figure).

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Basic dynamic load of paired bearings
 Basic dynamic load given in bearings tables is 
valid for each single bearing. Basic dynamic load of a 
paired bearings set can be determined according to 
the specifications on page 20-21.
Basic static load of paired bearings
 Basic static load of paired bearings can be 
similarly determined, multiplying the values of C0r in 
the tables by 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
Bearing speed limit
 Single row angular contact ball bearings are used 
at high speeds.
 The values of speeds for bearings series 72B and 
73B, normal tolerance class, without preload are 
given in this catalogue.
 In case of preloaded bearings, for single mounted 
bearing and bearings in DB, DF or DT arrangements, 
speed should be multiplied by the coefficients in 
table 7.
 For bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A, 
speeds are given for the tolerance class P4 and light 
preload.
 In case of bearings with other values of preloads 
or arrangements of 3 or 4 bearing sets, the speeds 
of the bearing of basic design should be multiplied by 
the values of the coefficients in table 7.
Abutment dimensions
 For a proper location of bearing rings on the shaft 
and housing shoulder respectively, shaft (housing) 
maximum connection radius ru max should be less than 
bearing minimum mounting chamfer r1min, r2 min.
 Shoulder height should also be properly sized in 
case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
 The values of the connection radii and support 
shoulder height are given in table 8.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Cylindrical roller bearings are manufactured in 
a various range of constructive types and sizes, 
particularly single row cylindrical roller bearings but 
also two or more row cylindrical roller bearings, with 
cages or roller by roller, as shown in the designs 
below.
 In case of cylindrical roller bearings, the rollers are 
laterally guided by the fixed ribs of one ring.
 In case of bearings with cages, the ring with ribs 
and the rollers retained in the cage can be drawn out 
from the other ring, which means that these bearings 
are dismountable.

- single row
 - double row
Suffixes
AR  - Grinding addition on the inner ring raceway
B   - Cylindrical roller bearings with extended  
     inner ring
C2  - Radial clearance smaller than normal,  
     bearings with interchangeable elements 
C2NA - Radial clearance smaller than normal,  
      bearings   with   non-interchangeable elements
C3  - Radial clearance larger than normal, bearings 
     with interchangeable elements 
C3NA - Radial clearance larger than normal, bearings 
     with non-interchangeable elements
 Therefore, bearings from joints can be much 
easier mounted and dismounted, especially were 
interference fits are needed for both rings due to the 
loading conditions.
 Bearings are provided with unloaded rollers at 
both generatrix ends. Therefore, the linear contact 
between rollers and rings alters advantageously, i.e. 
peripheral stresses are avoided.

Single or more rows cylindrical roller bearings
 Single or more rows cylindrical roller bearings 
are manufactured by URB in various constructive 
versions, depending on the position of the ribs on 
rings. The four basic designs (NU, NJ, N and NUP) are 
given in the bearing tables.
 Bearings of NU design have two fixed ribs on the 
outer ring and one smooth inner ring. Bearings of 
N design have two fixed ribs on the inner ring and 
one smooth outer ring. These designs allow an axial 
displacement in certain limits, of the shaft in relation 
to the housing. Therefore, these rolling bearings are 
used in non-locating bearing units.
 Bearings of NJ design have two fixed ribs on the 
outer ring and a fixed rib on the inner ring which can 
guide the shaft in a single direction (axially).
 Bearings of NUP design have also two fixed ribs 
on the outer ring and, on the inner ring, a fixed rib 
and a support washer. This way they can be used 
as locating bearings, guiding the shaft axially in both 
directions.
 For a shaft guiding in a single direction, it also can 
be used a bearing of NU design which is combined 
with a support washer. Thus, the constructive version 
NUJ is obtained.
 Support washers on both sides of a bearing of 
NU design are not allowed as they lead to an axial 
blocking of the rollers.
 Cylindrical roller bearings can carry heavy radial 
loads and can operate at high speeds.
 Double or more rows cylindrical roller bearings 
have small sections, high load carrying capacity and 
stiffness.
 These bearings provide high stiffness and 
maximum load carrying capacity and are particularly 
used for tool holders of the machine- tools and rolling 
mills.
 Double row cylindrical roller bearings series 
NNU49 and NN30 are generally manufactured to 
tolerance classes P5 and SP, used for machine tools.
 Large-sized bearings series NNU49 are also 
manufactured to the normal tolerance class.

rings. This design simplifies the bearing joint as the 
bearings are located into the housing by means of 
the snap rings. The snap ring groove and snap rings 
are in accordance with ISO 464, and tables 7 and 8 
on page 90 and 92.
Cylindrical roller bearings
without cage (full complement)
 These bearings incorporate the maximum number 
of rollers and have a small section in relation to their 
width.
 This provides a high load carrying capacity and 
allows space-saving designs to be achieved.
 Cylindrical roller bearings without cage cannot 
be used at speeds as high as those with cages. 
These bearings are manufactured with single or 
more row rollers and suffix V is added to the bearing 
designation. The most utilized bearings are those of 
series NCF29 V, NCF30 V and NJ23 VH and they are 
given in this catalogue on page 210.
Dimensions
 The main dimensions of standardized bearings 
given in tables are in accordance with IS015.
Misalignment
 The modified contact between rollers and raceway 
allows not only peripheral stresses to be avoided but 
also, in case of single row roller bearings, permits an 
angular misalignment of the outer ring with respect 
to the inner ring, depending on the bearing series 
and load according to the table 1.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Tolerances and radial clearance
 Single row cylindrical roller bearings are usually 
manufactured to normal tolerance class with normal 
radial clearance. They can also be manufactured 
to more accurate tolerance classes and with larger 
(C3NA and C4NA) or smaller (C1NA and C2NA) radial 
clearances. 
 Tolerances of cylindrical roller bearings are given 
on pages 28.
 Radial clearances according to international 
standard ISO 5753 are given in tales 2 and 3 for 
cylindrical bore bearings both with interchangeable 
rings and with non-interchangeable rings (NA).
Cages
 Small and medium-sized single row cylindrical 
roller bearings are generally fitted with pressed sheet 
cages. Large-sized bearings are fitted with machined 
brass cages of normal design, i.e. cages of separable 
design guided on rolling elements M, on the outside 
surface MA or inner surface MB. In case of heavy 
loads and high speeds, cages are made in one piece.
 Glass fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages, 
are successfully used for small and medium-sized 
bearings, if the operating temperature doesn’t 
exceed + 120ºC. These cages have low mass, low 
coefficient of friction and are noiseless while running.
 Cage design and some technical data are given in 
table 4.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Minimum load
 Cylindrical roller bearings must be subjected to a 
given minimum load, so that a proper operation of 
these bearings can be guaranteed.
 This is necessary especially as the bearings are 
operated at high speeds and the centrifugal forces 
produce additional friction in bearing due to the 
sliding between rollers and raceway.
 The values of the minimum load can be enough 
accurately calculated using the equation:

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
Equivalent dynamic radial load
 For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially loaded 
which don’t locate shafts axially, equivalent dynamic 
load is:
 Pr = Fr, kN
 If cylindrical roller bearings have ribs on the outer 
and inner rings and locate shafts axially in one or 
both directions, equivalent dynamic load can be 
calculated using the equations:
 Pr = Fr, kN, 

when Fa/Fr ≤ e
 Pr = 0,92 Fr + Y Fa, kN,  
when Fa/Fr > e
 Where:
 e - calculation factor with values:

- 0,2 for series 10,2,3 and 4

- 0,3 for series 22,23
 Y - factor for axial load

- 0,6 for series 10,2,3 and 4

- 0,4 for series 22,23
 Cylindrical roller bearings axially loaded run 
satisfactorily only if they are simultaneously radially 
loaded. Ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,5 for bearings 
of E design and 0,4 for the other bearings.
Equivalent static radial load
 For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially 
loaded, equivalent static load is:
 P0r = Fr, kN
Dynamic axial load
 Bearings with ribs on the outer ring can 
accommodate axial loads in addition to radial 
loads. The axial load carrying capacity of cylindrical 
roller bearings do not depend essentially on the 
steel fatigue strength, but on the resistance of the 
sliding surfaces at the roller end and rib contact and 
therefore on lubrication, operating temperature and 
bearing thermal conductivity.
 Considering the above mentioned, axial load 
carrying capacity of a cylindrical roller bearing can 
be enough accurately calculated using the following 
equation:

 where:
 Fa max 
- maximum permissible axial load, kN
 C0r 
- radial static load, kN
 Fr 
- radial load component, kN
 n  
- operating speed, r/min
 d  
- bearing bore diameter, mm
 D 
- bearing outside diameter, mm
 k1 
- auxiliary factor, see table 5
 k2 
- auxiliary factor, see table 5
 The above equation is based on conditions which 
are considered typical for normal bearing operation:
 - a difference of 60ºC between the bearing
   operating temperature and the ambient  
   temperature
 - a specific heat loss from the bearing of 
   0,5 mW/mm2 ºC
 - a viscosity ratio k=2.
 The viscosity ratio k is the ratio of the actual 
viscosity at the operating temperature to the requisite 
viscosity for a proper lubrication at that temperature. 
Further details can be found in subchapter “Adjusted 
rating life”, life adjustment factor a23 - on page 21.
 In case of grease lubrication, the base oil viscosity 
of the grease should be used. These effects can be 
reduced at low speeds by using oils with EP additives.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The values of permissible axial load Fa max obtained 
from the equation above mentioned are valid for 
a continuously acting constant axial load. If axial 
loads act only for short periods, the values may be 
multiplied by 2 or for shock loads by 3.
 The constantly acting axial load Fa max (N) should 
never exceed the numerical value of 1,2 D2 (D = 
bearing outside diameter, mm) and occasional shock 
loads should never be greater than the numerical 
value of 3D2.
 In case of heavy axial loads (Fa > D2), the ribs of the 
outer and inner ring respectively are recommended to 
be supported by the bearing ad joint parts. Bearings 
of NUP and NJ+HJ designs which take axial loads in 
both directions are to be placed so that main axial 
loads should be taken by fixed ribs, if bearing design 
allows.
Heat treatment
 Cylindrical roller bearings with outside diameter D 
> 240 mm of all series given in the catalogue are 
to be subject to a heat treatment of stress relieving 
which allows bearings to be operated up to a 
temperature of +150ºC.
 The hardness of rigs should not be less 59 HRC. 
 Small-sized bearings operate normally up to 
+120ºC.
Abutment dimensions
 For a proper location of bearing rings on the shaft 
and housing shoulder respectively, shaft (housing) 
maximum radius ru max should be less than bearing 
minimum mounting chamfer rs min.
 Shoulder height should also be properly sized in 
case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
 The values of the connection radius and support 
shoulder height are given in table 6.
 Abutment dimensions for single row cylindrical 
roller bearings are given in table 7. The values for 
double row cylindrical roller bearings are given in 
table 8.

DIN 616
 Double row cylindrical roller bearings,

DIN 5412 / part 4
General
 Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of series 
NN30 and NNU 49 are separable radial bearings.
 They are frequently used as non – locating bearings 
arrangements of working spindles for machine tools. 
Therefore, these bearings are often used in high 
precision tolerance class, frequently in combination 
with reduced internal clearance. These bearings also 
feature high radial load capacity and are satisfactory 
for high speed applications, providing a very stiff and 
rigid bearing arrangement. They are also commonly 
used with tapered bores, namely suffix K, (i.e. taper 
1:12).
Design variants of Double Row
Cylindrical Roller Bearings
 Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of series 
NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are produced and available 
either with or without tapered bores, as standard (see 
also figure below).
 Bearings of series NN 30.. comprise of a plain 
outer ring and an inner ring with three integral 
shoulders to guide the two separate rows of rollers 
around the raceway. These bearings series are 
produced with lubrication facilities in their outer ring, 
such as a circumferential lubrication groove and 
holes as standard, name suffix W33.
 Unlike the NN30.. series the double row cylindrical 
roller bearings of the NNU 49.. series feature 
opposite internal design characteristics, (i.e. outer 
ring with 3 integral shoulders around the raceway 
and a plain inner ring). These bearing series also 
feature lubrication facilities in their outer ring as 
standard, also namely, suffix W33.
Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings

125
GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Cylindrical roller bearings of series NN30.. and 
NNU49.. allow for compensation of length changes 
within the bearings itself. In this way they are ideal 
non-locating bearings.
 Both bearing rings may be mounted with heavy 
interference fit to shaft and housing.
Misalignment
 Double Row Cylindrical Roller bearings are not 
able to accomodate misalignments.
Tolerances
 Double Row Cilindrical Roller Bearings of 
series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are frequently used 
as spindle bearings.
 Consequently, they are also available with closer 
tolerance classes, such as P4 or SP, as standard.
 On request these bearings are also be produced to 
other tolerance classes.
 Detailed tolerance values, for URB double row 
cylindrical roller bearings and URB double row 
cylindrical roller bearings in spindle bearing design, 
tolerance class SP, are listed in the table shown in 
the chapter “Bearing tolerances” page 25.
Cages
 URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of the 
series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are produced with roller 
riding solid brass cages as standard.
Internal clearance
 URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
are produced with normal internal clearance 
(clearance group CN, historically designated C0) 
as standard. Other internal radial clearances are 
produced upon order request.
 NOTE:
 URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
of series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. produced to high 
precision design are frequently used with reduced 
internal radial clearance (clearance group C1).
 As these bearings are produced to very closed 
tolerances, 
under 
no 
circumstances 
should 
components be mixed or exchanged with other 
bearing parts.
 The value of internal clearance groups of URB 
Cylindrical Roller Bearings are listed in the tables on 
pages 155-156.
 These Values conform, as far as they are 
standardised, and conform to DIN 620/part 4 and 
ISO 5753-1, respectively.
Minimum load
 The minimum load applied to fast rotating double 
row cylindrical roller bearings should be higher than 
4 % of it’s dynamic load rating Cr.
Equivalent Dynamic bearing load
 Since double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
of series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are non – locating 
bearings, they are not able to accomodate any thrust 
loads.
P = Fr
Equivalent static bearing load
 For Single and Double row cylindrical roller 
bearings:
P0 = Fr
Mounting
 When handling High Precision double row 
cylindrical roller bearings particular attention must 
be paid to the relevant instructions of fitting and 
mounting of these bearings.
 When double row cylindrical roller bearings, with

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
tapered inner bores, are mounted the effect on 
the running clearance can be adjusted to obtain a 
specific clearance or preload.
 As these bearing types are separable under 
no circumstances should either components or 
assembled bearings be mixed or exchanged with 
other bearing parts.
Abutment and fillet dimensions for Double row 
cylindrical roller bearings
 The bearing rings must only contact adjacent 
parts with their side faces. The bearing corners must 
not touch the corner fillet radii or either the shaft or 
housing corners.
 Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of the 
bearings rings (rs) as listed in the bearing tables, also 
see next page.
 Recommendations for the dimensions of adjacent 
parts are listed in DIN 5418.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 Tapered roller bearings have the rolling elements 
under the form of a frustum of a cone.
 They roll on tapered surfaces which, if it’s 
extended, converge towards a single point on the 
bearing axis.
 The rollers are guided tangentially by the cage and 
axially by the big rib of the outer ring, on which they 
have point contact. As between roller and raceways 
there is linear contact, tapered roller bearings can 
take heavy radial loads. They can also take heavy 
axial or combined loads, depending on the contact 
angle caused by the tapered rolling elements. The 
Suffixes
A  - increased basic load
B  - enlarged contact angle
F  - machined cage of hardened steel or special  
    cast iron
F2 - constructive modifications
J  - pressed cage of not hardened steel sheet
K  - tapered bore 1:12
M  - machined brass cage
contact angle is the angle of the outer raceway 
generatrix.
 Constructive versions for single row tapered roller 
bearings:

- single row
P6X- tolerance class with smaller values than normal
P5 - tolerance class with smaller values than P6X
P4 - tolerance class with smaller values than P5
P2 - tolerance class with smaller values than P4
R  - rib on the outer ring
S0 - operating temperature up to +150ºC
S1 - operating temperature up to +200ºC
TN - polyamide cage
X  - modified main dimensions according to ISO
Tapered roller bearings
Single row tapered roller bearings
   Single row tapered roller bearings are of separable 
design, i.e. the outer ring and the inner ring with 
rollers and cage assembly can be separately 
mounted. These two assemblies are interchangeable.
   Tapered roller bearings can be manufactured both 
in standardized constructive versions with
dimensions series 320, 302, 322, 303, 323, 313 
and with non-standardized dimensions, mm or inch.
   Tapered roller bearings can carry only single 
direction axial loads. Under pure radial loads, an
axial force occurs which is supossed to distance the 
bearing ring in axial direction.
   Therefore, tapered roller bearings are generally pair 
mounted on both ends of the shaft, in “X” or “O”
arrangements, so that the shaft will be axially located 
in both directions (table 3). Thus, the optimum 
clearance in these two bearings can be adjusted.  
   Single row tapered roller bearings can also 
be manufactured with rib on the outer ring. This 
design is to be used when the housing cannot be 
manufactured with shoulder, but only with a passed 
through bore. In this case, axial location can be 
provided by the bearing ring.
   Permissible values of misalignment between shaft 
and housing are given in table 1, depending on 
bearing size and load magnitude. 
Tolerances
 Tapered roller bearings are generally manufactured 
215

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
to the normal tolerance class ISO and AFBMA, 
respectively (for bearings with inch dimensions).
 For certain applications (e.g. bearings for machine-
tools), they can be also manufactured to tolerance 
classes P5 and P6X or 3 AFBMA.
 At request, they can be manufactured to tolerance 
class P4.
 Single row tapered roller bearings have the outer 
rings interchangeable with the inner ring - rollers 
- cage assembly (if they have the same mark) and 
also with bearings produced by other companies, 
according to ISO and AFBMA respectively.
 The tolerances for bearings overall dimensions are 
given in tables on the pages 34-38 for tapered roller 
bearings, both with metric and inch dimensions. 
Tolerances for mounting chamfer are given in tables 
on page 42.
Cages
 Small and medium-sized tapered roller bearings 
are generally fitted with pressed sheet cages. Large 
sized bearings are generally fitted with machined 
steel or brass cages, with welded pins. In some 
cases, median or large sized bearings can also be 
fitted with machined steel or brass cages. In all 
cases, the cage is guided on rollers.
 For small and medium sized bearings, glass fibre 
reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages can be successfully 
used if the operating temperature doesn’t exceed 
+120°C. They have low mass, are noiseless in 
operation an have low coefficient of friction.
 Design and some technical data are given in table 2.
Equivalent dynamic radial load
 Equivalent dynamic radial load can be calculated 
using the following equations:
 Pr=Fr, kN,              
when Fa/Fr ≤ e
 Pr= 0,4 Fr + YFa, kN,  
when Fa/Fr > e
 Fa values can be calculated using the equations in 
table 3.
 These equations are available when bearings 
are mounted so that axial clearance is in fact zero 
without preloading. FrA and FrB should always be 
considered as being positive, even if they act in the 
opposite direction to that in the figure.
 The values of e, Y are given in bearing tables.

Equivalent static radial load
 Equivalent static radial load can be calculated 
using the equations:
 P0r=Fr, kN,  

when Fa/Fr ≤ 1/2 Y0
 P0r= 0,5 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN,  
when Fa/Fr > 1/2 Y0
 Fa is calculated as in case of equivalent dynamic 
radial load. The values of Y0 are given in bearing 
tables.
Abutment dimensions
 The mounting dimensions of tapered roller 
bearings are given in the bearings tables, for single 
row tapered roller bearings. These dimensions are 
also available for bearings with ribs.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
CA design
 These bearings have side shoulders and an 
one-piece machined brass cage. They also have 
symmetrical rollers with larger dimensions so that 
the load carrying capacity increases. This design is 
available for medium and large-sized bearings
 Other constructive versions are shown below:
 Cylindrical bore, lubrication groove and holes in 
the outer ring
 Tapered bore, lubrication groove and holes in the 
outer ring (taper 1:12,1:30)
 With adapter sleeves
 With withdrawal sleeves.
Spherical roller bearings
 Spherical roller bearings operate in arduous 
conditions. The spherical rollers can be symmetrical 
or unsymmetrical and are self-aligning in the outer 
ring sphered raceway. Thus, the possible coaxiality 
deviations of the supporting bearings as well as shaft 
bending can be compensated.
 Spherical roller bearings are manufactured in the 
following constructive versions, depending on the 
bearing size and series.
MB design
 These bearings have a central fixed rib and 
machined cages guided on the inner ring rib.
MA design
 These bearings have a central fixed rib and 
machined cages guided on the outer ring rib.
C design
 These bearings have a central guide rib floating 
on the inner ring, symmetrical rollers with larger 
dimensions so that the load carrying capacity 
increases. Special pressed sheet cage. Bearings of 
this design are of small and medium sizes.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 The dimensions of the bearings nuts are in 
accordance with national standard SR ISO 2982-2.
 The dimensions of the withdrawal sleeves are In 
accordance with national standard SR ISO 2982-1 
and pages 416-437.
Misalignment
 Spherical 
roller 
bearings 
allow 
angular 
misalignment between the outer ring and Inner ring 
without any influence on the bearing rating life. Under 
normal loads and operating conditions and when 
the Inner ring rotates, the values of the permissible 
misalignment depending on the bearing series are 
given In table 3.
Cages
 Small and medium size spherical roller bearing 
are fitted with pressed sheet or machined brass 
cages (Y). Bearings of normal design are fitted with 
machined brass or steel cages guided on the rollers 
(M), inner ring (MB) or outer ring raceway (MA).
 Glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages 
are successfully used for small and medium size 
bearings if the operating temperature doesn’t exceed 
+120°C.
 Large-size bearings are fitted with machined 
brass cages, CA design.
 Designs and some technical data are given in 
table 4.

Lubrication grooves and holes
 Spherical roller bearings are provided with a 
lubrication groove and holes in the outer ring, 
excepting those of series 213. Designation suffix 
W33 is used to identify this feature on bearings. The 
dimensions of the groove, bore diameter and their 
number depending on the dimension series are given 
in table 5.
Axial load for bearings mounted on adapter 
sleeves
If the spherical roller bearings are mounted on a 
smooth shaft using an adapter sleeve, without side 
support, the axial load carrying capacity depends on 
the friction between shaft and sleeve.
 Considering that the mounting is correctly done, 
the permissible axial load can be accurately enough 
determined using the following equation
 Fa max = 3 * B * d, KN
 where:
 Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, KN;
 B - bearing width, mm;
 d - bearing bore diameter, mm.

Equivalent dynamic radial load
 Pr =Fr+Y1Fa, kN,for Fa/F<e 
 Pr=67 Fr+Y2Fa, kN, for Fa/Fr>e
 The values of the factors depending on the bearing 
type can be found in bearing tables.
Equivalent static radial load
 P0r=Fr+Y0 * Fa, KN
 The value of the factor Y0 depending on the 
bearing type can be found in bearing tables.
Abutment dimensions
 For a proper location of bearing rings on the shaft 
and housing shoulder respectively, shaft (housing) 
maximum connection radius ru max should be less 
than bearing minimum mounting chamfer rs min.
 Shoulder height should also be properly sized in 
case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
 The values of the connection radii and support 
shoulder height are given in tableb.The mounting 
dimensions for bearings with withdrawal sleeves are 
given in table 6.

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 For applications where some misalignment may 
occur, single direction thrust ball bearings of the 
series 532, 533 and 534 are also available with 
sphered housing washers, figure b.
 These bearings may be applied either direct to 
sphered shaped bearings seats or, they may be used 
together with seating washers of series U2, U3 or 
U4 (see figure c).
 Unlike single direction thrust ball bearing types, 
double direction thrust ball bearings are suitable 
to guide the shaft in both directions (see figure d, e 
and f).
 These bearings consist of two washers, two balls 
and cage thrust assemblies with one common 
shaft washer located centrally in between.
 Double direction thrust ball bearings are also 
available in both designs, with at housing washers 
(series 522, 523 and 524 figure d) and with sphered 
housing washers (series 542, 543 and 544 figure e).
 For compensation of possible aligning errors the 
double direction thrust ball bearings may be used in 
conjunction with Seating Washers (series U2, U3 
and U4, see figure f).

General
 Thrust Ball Bearings are separable axial bearings 
that are produced in both single and double direction 
acting design. To assist in simple effective mounting 
or dismounting the bearing washers, seating’s, 
and cage and ball assemblies, may be individually 
mounted in their arrangement location.
 Thrust 
ball 
bearings 
may 
accommodate 
comparatively high axial loads but they must not be 
exposed to any radial forces.
 Due to their specific kinematic behavior, thrust 
ball bearings are only suitable for low to medium 
operating speeds.
 Furthermore, they require minimum axial loads for 
their optimum function. Since thrust ball bearings 
do not compensate any misalignment, they are also 
frequently used in conjunction with sphered housing 
washers and seating washers.
Design variants (see drawing on next page)
 Thrust ball bearings are produced in both, 
single direction and double direction design. The 
most important design variants are shown on the 
next page.
 Single direction thrust ball bearings consist of 
a shaft washer, a housing washer and a ball and 
cage thrust assembly (see figure a, b and c).
 These bearings are able to accommodate axial 
loads in one direction only.
 Single direction thrust ball bearings of series 
511, 512, 513 and 514 have plain housing washers, 
(see figure a).

Equivalent static bearing load
 For thrust ball bearings:
 P0=Fa
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for thrust ball 
bearings
 The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts 
with their face sides only. The radii of bearing 
shoulder fillet radii of the shaft or housing shoulders.
 Therefore fillet radius (rg) must be smaller than the 
minimum fillet dimension of the bearing rings (rs) as 
listed in the bearing tables.
Misalignment
 All thrust ball bearings with flat housing 
washers do not allow any misalignment.
 The contacting surfaces of both shaft and housing 
seats must be parallel. Misalignments can only be 
accommodated by using Thrust Ball bearings with 
sphered housing washers.
Cages
 URB thrust ball bearings are normally fitted with 
pressed steel cages as standard.
 For larger thrust ball bearings solid brass cages 
(suffix M), or solid steel cages (suffix F), are fitted as 
standard.
Tolerances
 URB thrust ball bearings are produced to normal 
class tolerance class (PN) as standard.
 For applications of higher dimensional and 
geometrical accuracy these bearings are produced to 
precision tolerance class (e.g. P6) on order request.
 For detailed values of the tolerance classes see 
chapter Bearing tolerances (see page 39-40).
Minimum load:
 Thrust ball bearings require a certain minimum 
axial load to ensure a satisfactory operating function.
 To prevent excessive sliding friction, the minimum 
axial load applied should be greater than 4% of the 
axial bearing dynamic load rating Ca.
 Where such a minimum axial load is not possible, 
the load must be increased by effective measures, 
(i.e. preloading the bearing) using pressure washers 
or springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
 Thrust ball bearings are pure axial bearings, 
there are not able to accommodate any radial loads, 
therefore:

GENERAL ROLLING BEARINGS
 With all cylindrical roller thrust bearings, increased 
sliding friction can occur at the end of the cylindrical 
rollers.
 In order to minimize this negative effect, URB 
cylindrical roller thrust bearings with wider sectional 
widths are produced using several short rollers in 
each cage pockets instead of using individual longer 
rollers.
 Due to their specific kinematic behavior, cylindrical 
roller thrust bearings are only suitable for low speed 
applications only. Furthermore, they require minimal 
axial loads for their optimum function.
Design variants
 URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings are produced 
in single direction design only as standard (see Abb. 
1a)

General
 Cylindrical Roller Thrust Bearings series 811 
and 812 are single direction acting separable axial 
bearings.
 Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are insensitive to 
shock loading and feature much higher load carrying 
capacity compared to thrust ball bearings. They 
accommodate very high axial loads but no radial 
forces. They provide a very rigid bearing assembly 
for high thrust loading with less space requirement.
 Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are of simple 
design, they consist of a shaft washer (WS), a 
housing washer (GS), and a cylindrical roller and 
cage thrust assembly (K), see Abb. 1.

classes see chapter “Bearing tolerances” (see page 
39-40).
Minimum load:
 All cylindrical roller thrust bearing require a certain 
minimum axial load to ensure a satisfactory operating 
function. To prevent excessive sliding friction, the 
minimum axial load applied should be greater than 
5% of the axial bearing dynamic load rating Ca. 
Where such a minimum axial load is not possible the 
load must be increased by effective measures, (i.e. 
preloading the bearing) using pressure washers or 
springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
 Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are pure axial 
bearings; they are not able to accommodate any 
radial loads, therefore:
 P = Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
 For cylindrical roller thrust bearings:
 P0 = Fa
Design of adjacent machine parts
 When cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
are used without washers, adjacent machines parts 
must be designed and machined as bearing raceways 
(e.g. hardened and ground etc.). The maximum 
permissible axial runout of the adjacent surfaces 
acting as raceway must also meet the requirements 
of the respective washers. The bore diameters of 
URB cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
have tolerances according to ISO Tolerance field 
(E11), whilst the tolerance of their outer diameters 
lies in the tolerance field (a13).
 Cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
require an effective guidance when operating at 
 Double direction acting cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings are built using a combination of the 
components from single direction acting cylindrical 
roller thrust bearings together with intermediate 
washers ZS, (see Abb. 1 b).
 Such intermediate washers are part of URB 
supplementary product range and are available 
on request. For application designs with space 
restrictions the cylindrical roller and cage thrust 
assemblies may be used without washers providing 
the contact faces of adjacent machine parts are 
machined as bearing raceways, (e.g. hardened and 
ground, etc.).
 The components of cylindrical roller thrust bearing 
are frequently used either separately or in conjunction 
with other components in several applications (e.g. to 
build needle roller thrust assemblies) therefore, they 
are available as loose parts.
Misalignment
 All cylindrical roller thrust bearing type do not 
allow any misalignment.
 The contacting surfaces of both shaft and housing 
seats must be parallel.
Cages
 Small URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings are 
fitted with shaft – centered polyamide cages as 
standard.
 Polyamide cages are suitable for operating 
temperatures up to +120ºC. Large cylindrical roller 
thrust bearings are produced with either solid brass 
cages (suffix MP), or with solid steel cages, (suffix 
FP).
Tolerances
 URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings are produced 
to normal class tolerance (PN) as standard.
 For applications of higher accuracy these bearings 
are produced to precision tolerance class (e.g. P6) 
on order request. For detailed values of the tolerance

higher speeds.
 To avoid excessive wear, at higher speeds, the 
guiding surface must be ground.
Bearing seats for cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings
 For the design of cylindrical roller thrust bearing 
seats the following of tolerance fields have proven to 
be satisfactory in practice:
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for cylindrical 
roller thrust bearings
 In case of cylindrical roller thrust bearings, an 
effective support of the bearing washers over the 
total width of their raceways by adjacent machine 
parts is necessary.
 The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts 
with their side face only. The fillet radii of bearing 
corners must not touch the shoulder fillet radii of the 
shaft or housing shoulders.
 Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fillet dimension of the 
bearing rings (rs) as listed in the following tables.
