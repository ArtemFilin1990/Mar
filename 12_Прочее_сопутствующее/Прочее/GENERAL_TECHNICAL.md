Each type of bearing displays characteristics 
features which make it suitable for a certain 
application. Therefore, many bearings types and 
costructive versions have been developed so that 
they can satisfy various demands for rolling bearings. 
Taking into account the great number of factors to 
be considered when selecting a bearing type, no 
general rule can be given.
We give further the most important criteria to be 
considered when selecting the bearing type.
Selection of bearing type, 
considering the load magnitude 
and direction
Radial load
Deep groove ball bearings are the most suitable 
types of bearings for light and moderate pure 
radial loads. For heavy radial load and where 
large-diameter shafts are used, double row 
cylindrical roller bearings are the adequate 
choice. Needle roller bearings are recomended in 
case of limited space and heavy loads.
Axial load
For pure axial loads, single direction thrust ball 
bearings are used in case of loads acting in one 
directions. For loads acting in both directions, 
double direction thrust ball bearings are used. 
Angular contact thrust ball bearing are and single 
or double row angular contact ball bearings are 
used in case of light or moderate pure axial loads 
at moderate speeds.
For light axial loads at high speeds, deep groove 
ball bearings are suitable. Under the axial load, 
a contact angle diff erent from 0° is generated 
in these bearings and therefore they operate as 
angular contact ball bearings. In order to increase 
Selection of bearing type
axial load carryng capacity, a larger clearance 
should be selected (C3, C4, etc.)
For moderate axial loads at highs speed, angular 
contact ball bearings in tandem arrangement are 
used so that they can take over loads acting in 
both directions.
Four-point contact ball bearings QJ type, are 
also used.
Combined load
In order to carry combined radial and axial loads 
acting simultaneously, bearings with a contact 
angle diff erent from 0° are used. The greater the 
contact angle, the greater the axial load carrying 
capacity.
Self-aligning ball bearings, spherical roller 
bearings or cylindrical roller bearings, NJ, NUP, NJ + 
HJ types, can also accommodate combined loads 
of certain values. But there are some limit values 
of the ratio Fa/Fr, which are shown in bearing 
tables and cannot be exceeded. Cylindrical roller 
bearings can carry axial loads by means of the 
sliding friction on ribs. For this reason, the load is 
limited according to the indications on page 204.
Bearings which accomodate only one direction 
axial loads should always be mounted in pairs so 
that they can carry axial loads in both directions.
Selection of bearing type 
considering the alignment between 
shaft and housing
Angular misalignments occur generally when 
the shaft bends under the operating load or when 
bearings adjoint parts have form or position 
deviations.
In such cases, self-aligning ball bearings, 
cylindrical roller bearings or spherical roller thrust 
bearings should be used. 
A certain bearing bent angle can compensate

for errors of alignment and maximum angle 
values are shown for each type in the introductory 
texts of the table sections.
When misalignments should be compensated, 
radial and axial clearance are important. The 
larger the clearance, the greater the possibility of 
self-aligning.
If the misalignment exceeds the permissible 
values shown in the introductory texts of the 
bearing tables, the bearing rating life decreases. 
The greater the ratio Fr/C0r, the shorter the rating 
life. If 0,1 < F0r/C0r < 3, the rating life decreases 
with about 25%.
Selection of bearing type 
considering the operating 
temperature
Bearings 
are 
generally 
used 
up 
to 
a 
temperature of maximum +120°C. In case of 
higher temperatures, bearings with special heat 
treatments should be used, in accordance with 
specifi cations on page 27.
Sealed bearings, 2RS type, should be used 
at operating temperatures up to 80°C. If this 
temperature is exceeded, the effi  cacy of lubricants 
is considerably reduced.
Selection of bearing internal 
clearance
In most cases, while operating, bearings should 
have a small radial clearance that can be defi ned 
as “the possible value of displacement in radial 
direction of one bearing ring in relation to the 
other without parts deformations”.
While operating, bearing internal clearance 
is diff erent from the one at delivery, since the 
latter is reduced when mounting bearings with a 
certain tight fi t.
Under operating conditions, internal clearance 
change is also caused by diff erent temperatures 
between the outer and inner ring. Bearings are 
generally delivered with a normal radial or axial 
clearance according to the values shown for each 
rolling bearing group.
The decrease in radial clearance due to the 
tight fi t and operating temperature is considered 
to be between 60-80% of the tightening value, 
depending on bearing series and size.
After the clearance in bearings has been 
decreased, a large enough operational clearance 
should remain, so that the lubricant fi lm shouldn’t 
be destroyed.
Deep groove ball bearings should have an 
operational clearance close to zero. There may 
be often a light preload, due to the point-contact 
between the rolling elements and raceways.
Small-sized cylindrical roller and needle roller 
bearings should have an operational clearance of 
5-10 μm and larger-sized bearings a clearance of 
10-30 μm.
Bearing producers can also manufacture - at 
request - bearings with radial and axial clearance 
smaller (C1 and C2) or larger (C3, C4 and C5) than 
normal, so that the most favorable operating 
conditions for bearings should be assured.
Cylindrical and needle roller bearings can be 
manufactured with interchangeable rings (suffi  x 
NA).
Bearings with non interchangeable parts have 
a smaller radial clearance than bearings with 
interchangeable parts. Changing rings from one 
bearing to another not allowed.
In case of bearings with interchangeable parts, 
the rings may be changed and the values of radial 
clearance will not be altered.
Bearing types and technical 
characteristics
URB bearing producers can be manufacture 
bearings of various type and size so that they 
can meet the customers’ requirements assuring a 
proper reliability for various applications.
Table 1.1 shows quantitative results of each 
group of bearings, considering the main technical 
characteristics.
Bearing type is selected depending on the 
technical characteristics required by a certain 
application.
A suggestive graphic symbol has been 
determined for each main technical characteristic. 
Thus, a proper bearing for each purpose can be 
easily chosen. According to the specifi cations in 
this catalogue, the proper type and size of bearing 
can be selected, togheter with all manufacturing 
and operating technical conditions.

The size of a bearing is selected considering the 
load in the used roling bearing and also depends 
on the operational rating life and prescribed 
operating safety.
Basic load ratings
The basic dynamic load rating Cr is used to 
calculate bearing dimensions while rotating 
under load. It expreses the bearing dmissible load 
which will give a basic rating life up to 1000 000 
revolutions.
The basic dynamic load ratings of URB bearings 
have been determined in accordance with 
international standard ISO 281. The values are 
given in bearing tables.
Considering the basic dynamic load rating, 
the service time until the fatigue of the material 
appears is calculated, determining this way the 
calculated rating life.
Basic static load rating Cor is considered in case 
of low speeds, low oscilating movements or in the 
stationary case.
The basic static load rating is defi ned in 
accordance with ISO 76, as the load acting 
upon the stationary bearing. It corresponds to 
a calculated contact stress in the center of the 
contact area between the most heavily loaded 
rolling element and the raceway, of:
- 4 600 MPa for self-aligning ball bearings,
- 4 200 MPa for all other ball bearings,
- 4 000 MPa for all roller bearings.
This stress produces a permanent deformations 
of the rolling element and raceway which is about 
0,0001 of the rolling element diameter. The loads 
are pure radial for radial bearings and pure axial 
for thrust bearings.
Selection of bearing size
Bearing life
The life of a rolling bearings is defi ned as the 
number of revolutions of the number of operating 
hours, which the bearings is capable to endure, 
before the fi rst sign of fatigue occurs on one of 
its rings, on the raceway or the rolling elements.
If we want to consider only the fatigue oh 
the bearing operating surfaces the following 
conditions have to be observed:
1. The forces and speeds considered when 
calculating the bearing should correspond to the 
real operating conditions.
2. Proper lubrication should be assured during 
the entire operating period.
3. If the bearing carries a light load, its failure is 
generated by the wear.
4. Experience showed that the failure of many 
bearings was caused by other reasons than 
fatigue, such as: selection of an inadequate 
bearing type  in a bearing joint, improper 
operation or lubrication, outer particles in 
bearing etc.
Basic rating life
The basic rating life of a single bearing or a group 
of apparently identical bearings operating under 
identical conditions, is the life corresponding to a 
reliability of 90%.
The average life of a group of bearings is 
approximately fi ve times longer than the basic 
rating life.
Basic rating life is marked with L10 (millions of 
revolutions) or L10h (operating hours).
L10 can be calculated using the equation:
 L
P
C
10
p
= `
j , where:

---

L10 
- basic rating life, milions of revolutions,
C 
- basic bearing load, kN,
P 
- equivalent dynamic bearing load, kN,
p 
-  exponent of the life equation with the 
following values:
p=3 

- for ball bearings
p = 10/3 
- for roller bearings
The 
equivalent 
dynamic 
bearing 
load, 
respectively the radial and axial load, acting 
simultaneously can be calculated using the 
following equations (applicable to ball and roller 
radial bearings):
Pr = Fr , kN, 
- for pure radial load
Pr = XFr + TFa, kN, - for combined load
For thrust ball bearings, the following equations 
can be used:
Pa = Fa, kN,  
- for pure axial load
Pa = XFr + YFa, kN, - for combined load
where:
Fr = the radial component of the load, kN
Fa = the axial component of the load, kN
In the texts preceding the bearing tables, for 
some groups of bearings there are given details 
for determinig the equivalent load. Values of the 
coeffi  cients X and Y can be found in tables.
For bearings operating at constant speed, the 
basic rating life expressed in operating hours can 
be calculated using the equation:
L
60 n
1000000 C/P
10h
p
=
^
h   or L
n
1
C/P
6666
10h
p
=
^
h
where:
n = rotational speed, r/min
Values of the basic rating life L10 (milions of 
revolutions) as a function of the ratio C/P can be 
found in the table 2.1.
Values of the basic rating life L10h (operating 
hours) as a function of the ratio C/P and speed 
n can be found in table 2.2 for ball bearings and 
table 2.3 for roller bearings.
When determining the bearing size it is 
necessary to base the calculations on the rating 
life corresponding to the purpose of operation.
It usually depends on the machine type, service 
life and the requirements regarding operational 
safety.
Approximate values of the service life for various 
classes of machines and equipments for general 
purposes are given in table 2.4
The basic rating life L10h of the bearings can be 
determined as a function of service life, using the 
life calculation chart on page ....
The basic rating life of road and rail vehicle 
bearings, for wheel - axle bearing, is expressed 
as a function of the wheel diameter and covered 
distance (km), using the equation:
L
D
1000 L
10h
10s
= r
, respectively: L
D L
1000
10
10
s = r
where:
L10 
- basic rating life, millions of revolutions
L10s 
- service life distance, millions of  

   kilometers
D 
- wheel diameter, m
Approximate values for the service life distance 
(kilometers covered), in case of light loaded cars 
and rail vehicles are given in table 2.5.

Example:
1. It is required to determine the size of a deep groove ball bearing single row, considering the following conditions:
- Basic rating life L10h = 25000 operating hours
- Rotational speed n = 1000 r/min
- Load in bearing Fr = 5 kN
The chart shows that C/P = 11,6; C = 11,6, P = 11,6 x 5 = 58 kN. In the catalogue on page 100, you can select the bearing 6310 
type with the following characteristics: Cr = 61,8kN; n = 7000 r/min.
2. What is the basic rating life o the bearing NU 210E which is operating under a radial load of 7,7 kN at rotational speed

See page 219 in the catalogue and you will fi nd for the bearing, NU 210E type, the following values: Cr = 63,7 kN, 
n = 8000 r/min. From the chart, for a bearing operated at a rotational speed of 750 r/min and Cr/Pr = 63,7/7,7 = 8,3, a basic

If the fl uctuating load acts in a pure radical

Basic dynamic load of a bearing 
group
In case of ball and roller bearings especially, a 
bearing group of the same type mounted close 
together is required, so that heavy radial loads 
can be carried.
In order to take over the load uniformly these 
bearings should be mounted in order to equal the 
diameter deviations to the radial clearances.
These deviations must be kept below 1/2 of the 
admitted tolerance class.
Basic dynamic load for a bearing group, as a 
function of the basic load of the single bearing, 
can be calculated using the equation:
Cri = Crin,
where:
Cri 
-  basic dynamic load of the bearing 
group, kN
Cr 
-  basic dynamic load of the single 
bearing, selected from the tables,
i 
-  number of bearings of the same 
type, mounted close together,
n 
-  exponent depending on the bearing 
type: 

0,7  - for ball bearings 

7/9 - for roller bearings

the respective group.
Adjusted rating life
Basic rating life L10h is often satisfactory 
for bearing performances. This life means a 
reliability of 90% for material and a modern and 
usual manufacturing technology, as well as for 
conventional operating conditions.
For a reliability over 90% (100-n)%, ISO 
recommends 
steels 
elaborated 
in 
better 
conditions, 
high 
level 
manufacturing 
technologies and specifi c operating conditions. 
In this case, adjusted rating life can be calculated 
as follows:

greater than 1, when calculating adjusted rating 
life, prudence and familiarity with bearing 
manufacturing 
and 
operating 
conditions, 
including shaft bending and housing stiff ness are 
recommended.
Life adjustement factor a1 for reliability
The bearing failure, caused by fatigue, is 
subjected to certain statistic laws. Therefore, this 
fact is recommended to be considered when 
calculating the bearing life.
Values of the life adjustment factor a1 for 
eliabilities over than 90% are given in table 2.7.

Life adjustment factor a2 for material
Life adjustment factor a2 takes into account the 
properties of the material, heat treatment of the 
steel and maufacturing technologies. For URB 
bearings, a2=1 is recommended.
Life adjustment factor a23 for operating 
conditions
The longest life of a bearing can be reached 
in case of hydrodynamic lubrication, namely 
where there is no direct contact between rolling 
elements and raceway due to the lubricant fi lm. 
In this fi eld, many studies have been done by 
world leading bearing manufacturing companies. 
These studies showed that there is relationship 
between life adjustment factor a2 for material and 
life adjustment factor a3 for operating conditions. 
Preferably these factors should be unifi ed, 
obtaining factor a23. In this case, adjusted rating 
life would be:
Lna = a1 a23 L10 or Lna = a1 a23 L10h
These values of a23 coeffi  cient depend on the 
lubricant used for bearing lubrication, namely 
on the ratio of the oil viscosity at +40°C, ν (initial 
value) to the viscosity required for adequate 
lubrication at the operating temperature ν1. The 
values are given in table 2.8.

The values of viscosity ν1, as  a function of the 
mean bearing diameter and operating speed, are

Kinematic viscosity ν at the temperature of 
+40°C can be determined from the diagram fi g. 
9 in accordance with ISO, if the bearing operating 
temperature is known.

22
In case of grease lubrication, calculation should 
be done considering the basic oil viscosity and 
the value of the life adjustment factor a23 will be 
smaller than 1.
Example of oil kinematic viscosity calculation for bearing 
lubrication:
The bearing 6212 operates at a speed of 3500 r/min and a 
temperature of +70°C.
Mean diameter will be:
0,5 (d+D) = 0,5 (60+110) = 85 mm
From the diagram fig. 9, at a temperature of +70°C, for a 
viscosity ν1 = 8 mm2/s, the viscosity at +40°C is 20 mm2/s 
(cSt).
In this case should be selected an oil in accordance with 
ISO VG22 with kinematic viscosity limits: νmin = 19,8 mm2/s 
(cSt) and νmax = 24,2 mm2/s (Cst)
In case of bearing operating at temperatures 
higher than +150°C, an adjustment factor ft 
for temperature should be added to the life 
adjustment factor a23. Adjusted rating life will be:
Lna = a1 a23 ft L10  or  Lna = a1 a23 ft L10h
Values for the life adjustment factor ft for 
temperature are given in table 2.9.
material fatigue but by permanent deformation 
caused at the rolling element/raceway contact.
It is also the case of rotating bearings, when 
they have to sustain heavy shock loads which act 
during a fraction of their revolution.
Generally, the value of the load may increase up 
to the value of the basic static load C0, without 
altering the bearing operating properties. 
Equivalent static load
Combined static load (radial and axial load acting 
simultaneosly on bearing) must be converted into 
an equivalent static bearing load. This is defi ned 
as the load (radial for radial bearings and axial for 
thrust bearings) which is applied, would cause 
the same permanent deformation in the bearing 
as the real load operating upon it.
Equivalent static load is obtained from the 
general equation:
P0 = X0 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN,
where:
P0 
- equivalent static bearing load, kN,
Fr 
-  radial component of the heaviest 
static load, kN,
Fa 
-  axial component of the heaviest 
static load, kN,
X0 
-  radial load factor of the bearing,
Y0 
-  axial load factor of the bearing.
Data needed to calculate equivalent static load 
can be found in text and in bearing tables.
Requisite basic static load rating
When determining bearing size on the basis of 
the static load, a static safety factor s0 is used.

Static load
When the bearing is stationary or rotates at slow 
movements or very low speeds (lower than 10 r/
min), basic static load is not determined by the 
Fig. 9

The requisite basic static load is calculated using 
the equation:
Cr0 = s0 Pr0, kN,
where:
Cr0 
- basic static load rating, kN,
s0 
- static safety factor, table 2.11,
Pr0 
- equivalent static load, kN.
At high temperatures, life of he material 
decreases and the static load carrying capacity of 
bearings is redeuced.
For high temperatures, basic static load is 
calculated using the equation:
Cr0 = f0t s0 Pr0, kN,

Rotating bearings
In case of fl uctuating or oscillating loads and 
especially when heavy shock loads are acting 
during a fraction of revolution, it is necessary  to 
check if the bearing has the proper static load 
carrying capacity.
Heavy shock loads, higher than the basic static 
bearing load, produce permanent deformations 
not uniformly distributed on raceway, which 
infl uence negatively upon bearing running.
Generally, heavy shock loads cannot be 
exactly calculated and in certain cases they 
produce deformations of bearing housing and 
consequently an unfavorable load distribution in 
bearing.
When a bearing rotates under maximum load, 
raceway becomes uniformly deformed on all its 
outer surface without any imprint.
For various operating conditions, maximum 
load acting upon the bearing is calculated with 
static safety factor s0, depending on the vibrations 
and shock loads.
The values of static safety factor are given in 
table 2.12.

Basic static load for a group of 
bearings
Where more bearings of the same type are 
mounted close together to take over a static load, 
the load magnitude supported by these bearings 
will be calculated from:
C0ri = C0r i,
where:
C0ri 
-  basic static load of the bearing 
group,
C0r 
-  basic static load of the single bearing 
(from tables),

- number of bearings.

Bearing tolerances have been internationally 
standardized in accordance with ISO 492, ISO 199, 
ISO 582, ISO 1132.
Bearings are generally  manufactured to the 
tolerance class P0. At request, they can also 
be manufactured to the tolerance classes P6, 
P6X, P5, P4 and P2. These bearings are used for 
special applications, such as very  accurate shaft 
guidance or very high speeds.

Locating bearings and non-locating 
bearings
Radial and axial loads in bearing units can 
be transmitted by locating and non-locating 
bearings.
A locations bearing is generally used for 
medium and large-sized shafts that can reach 
high temperatures during operation. It has to 
support radially the shaft assembly and to locate 
it axially in both directions.
A non-locating bearing supports the shaft 
assembly only radialy. It also allows axial 
displacement in relation to the housing to take 
place so that additional axial loading is avoided.
Axial displacement can take place either in the 
housing bore seating or in the bearing itseft.
In case the shaft is supported by more than 
two bearings, only one of them will  be a locating 
bearing and it will be the one with the lightest 
radial load.
In case of small-sized shaft, two non-locating 
bearings with limited displacement can be used. 
Each of them can accommodate axial loads in a 
single direction, having thus mutual location.
Fig. 4.1 shows a few of the most representative 
applications 
of 
locating 
and 
non-locating 
bearings, as follows:
a) The locating bearing is a single row deep 
groove ball bearing and the non-locating one 
is a cylindrical roller bearing with both rings 
tightly fi tted on the shaft and into the housing, 
respectively.
b) Both bearings are supported by spherical 
roller berings. The locating bearing is tightly fi tted 
both on the shaft and into the housing. The non-
locating bearing has the outer ring mounted with 
clearance into the housing and thus allows aaxial 
displacement in both directions.
c) The locating bearing consist of a cylindrical 
roller bearing, NUP type and the non-locating 
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU 
type.

46
d) The locating bearing consist of a cylindrical 
roller bearing, NUP type. The non-locating 
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU 
type.
e) The locating bearings consists of a cylindrical 
roller bearing, NU type which takes over radial 
loads and of a four-point contact ball bearing 
(unloaded on the outside). The non-locating 
bearing consists of a cylindrical roller bearing, NU 
type.
f) The locating bearing consists of a needle roller 
bearing, NA type which takes over radial loads 
and of a single row deep groove ball bearing 
(unloaded on the outside) which takes over axial 
loads in both directions. The non-locating bearing 
consists of a needle roller bearing, NA type.
g) The shafts bearings can also be X-type 
arrangement of two tapererd roller bearings 
which can be considered mutual located bearing.
Recommendation for bearing fi t 
selection
Three main criteria have to be considered when 
selecting the bearing fi t:
1. Firm loaction and uniform support of rings
2. Ease of mounting and dismounting
3. Axial displacement of non-locating bearing
The most common location is assured by  tight fi t.
A high tightening is recommended for roller 
bearings and large- sized bearings in comparasion 
to ball bearings of the same size.
In case of a tight fi t, the inner ring is supported 
by the entire shaft contact surface, thus bearing is 
used at full load carrying capacity.
The tolerance classes given in table 4.1 and 4.3 
are available for bearing fi ts which do not exceed 
+120°C during operation.
As a general rule, the selection of the tolerance 
class "H" is recommended for bearings of 
separable design and tolerance class "J" for 
bearings of non-separable design.
When selecting a fit, the load of rotating ring 
has to consider, namely:
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is 
stationary, the outer ring should be mounted 
with clearance fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the load is 
stationary, the outer ring should be mounted 
with tight fit.
- If the inner ring rotates and the direction of 
load is not determined, both rings should be 
mounted with tight fit.
In table 4.1, there are given recommendations 
to select the tolerance class for shaft as function 
of: bearing type, loading and shaft diameter. In 
table 4.3, one can find recommendations to select 
the tolerance class for housing.
Figure 4.2 shows schematically the tolerance 
classes for shaft and housing and their influence 
over fit type i.e. clearance, transition or tight fit 
for housing and transition fit or tight fit for shaft, 
respectively.
In tables 4.2 and 4.4, the deviations of the shaft 
diameter (4.2) and of the housing diameter (4.4) 
are given, considering the following: 
- upper and lower limits
- theoretical minimum and maximum values of 
tightening (+) or clearance (-) in the fit
- the minimum and maximum values of the 
probable tightening or clearance in the fit (99% 
of fits are between these limits).
The tolerances of bore diameter dmp and 
outside diameter Dmp are valid for all metric 
sized bearings, except tapered roller bearings 
with d<30 mm and D<150 mm and thrust ball 
bearings with D≤150 mm, (see table 3.15 and 3.16 
on page 34 and table 3.31 and 3.32 on page 40)

Bearing axial location
Axial location of bearings is necessary for a 
proper guiding of bearing in an assembly under 
operation.
An tight fi t is iandequate for the axial location 
of bearing. In case of locating bearings, axial 
location for both rings is generally needed. Some 
important solutions of bearing axial location, on 
shaft or into the housing are shown in Fig. 4.4.
In case of bearings with light axial loads, 
bearings can be located using a lock nut and a 
lock waher (a), an end plate fastened by a screw 
at the shaft end (b) and, for bearings carryng light 
axial loads, by lock rings mounted in shaft and 
housing grooves (c).
Bearings with NR design, with groove and snap 
ring on the outer ring, can be easily located by 
the lock ring (d). Tapered roller bearings can be 
located by supporting the inner ring on the shaft 
shoulder and the outer ring with a threaded ring 
and a safety plate fastened by a screw (e).
Tapered bore bearings can be mounted and 
axially located by adapter or withdrawal sleeves 
(f, g).
The axial load carrying capacity of the bearings 
mounted with adapter or withdrawal sleeves 
is governed by the friction between shaft and 
sleeve (g). 
To locate radial bearings, where axial adjustment 
of the shaft is required, setting washers (i) or 
spacer rings (i) are used between the outer rings, 
the width of the spacer ring being experimentally 
determined, during mounting.
Bearing sealing
Seals are used in most of bearing arrangements 
and they must ensure the conditions of a proper 
operation.
For such a purpose, they have to prevent 
solid contaminants (dust, hard particles, water, 
aggressive substances etc.) from penetrading 
into the bearing and at the same time to retain 
the lubricant in the bearing.
Seals for rolling bearings can be classifi ed 
considering some important criteria such as: 
design, operation, type of lubricant etc.
Considering their design and operation, seals 
can be: stationary seals between the stationary 
bearing elements (housing and cover), rotary 
seals, between the rotating bearing elements and 
they also can be rubbing seals or non-rubbing 
seals, which are used in special applications 
(surrounding conditions and loading stress).
Rotary non-rubbing seals are often used due to 
their simple design. They are particulary used at 
high speeds or temperatures, bothh for grease 
and oil, and have practically no friction and do 
not wear.
In case of bearing grease lubrication, bearing 
operating temperature must be lower with 200C 
than the dropping point of the grease (melting 
temperature).
The main constructive types of rotary non-
rubbing seals have narrow gaps, labyrinths and 
their combinations are shown in fi g. 4.5 a-c.
Gap seals represent the simplest constructive 
solution for a rotary non-rubbing seal which 
have to retain grease in the bearing housing. The 
effi  cacy of sealing depends on the gap lenght (L) 

---

62
They are shown in fi g. 4.6 a-d.
The labyrinths are spaces where periodically 
water-in-soluble grease (e.g. Lithium or Calcium 
base grease) is to be supplied.
The tongues of the labyrinth seals can be 
radically (a), axially (b) arranged or they can have 
inclined passages.
Details of an axial labyrinth design are given in 
fi g. 4.6 d and values of axial clearance r and length 
L are given in table 4.8.
In case of rotary rubbing seals there is a direct 
contact between a seal elastic element and the 
rotating element. They are shown in fi g. 4.8.
When selecting the proper rotary rubbing 
seal, the folowing factors have to be considered: 
material and its elasticity (felt, rubber, plastics, 
leather, graphite, asbestos etc.); resistance at 
varoius temperatures, maximum peripherical 
speed on sealing surface; sealing direction etc.
These systems have sealing properties higher 
than those corresponding to non-rubbing seals. 
In case of grease lubrication at peripheral speeds 
higher than 4 m/s and temperatures over +1000C, 
felt ring seals (a) are frequently used because of 
their simple design and cheapness.
Before mounting, felt rings are impregnated 
during an hour with a mixture of mineral oil 
(66%) and paraffi  n (34%), at a temperature of 
+70...+800C so that sealing properties are 
improved as the friction is reduced.
At higher temperatures and peripheral speeds 
over 12 m/s, surface roughness is Ra=1,6 μm and 
the space between the ends of the seal should be 
fi lled with grease. Two felt rings can be used for 
sealing.
Rubbing seals with a spring incorporated are 
preferably to be used in case of oil lubricated 
bearings which are operated under peripherical 
speeds of 5-10 m/s, temperatures between -400C 
and +200C. Their effi  cacy depends on the material 
and operating surroundings.
and the clearance between shaft and housing. 
It can be improved by providing one or more 
circular grooves on the shaft or in the housing, 
which are to be fi lled with grease (b). In case of 
oil lubrication, the grooves on the shaft must be 
helical (c) and their direction must be the same 
with the direction of the shaft rotary movement.
Experiments proved that most favorable 
clearance is obtained between the limits of the 
fi t A11/h10, geometrical deviations should be IT6 
and gap surface roughness Ra = 12,6 μm.
Labyrinth seals are used at high peripheral 
speeds, in impure surroundings. 

---

63
In most cases, rubbing seals with a spring 
incorporated are made of synthetic rubber and 
have a metallic hardering fi xture.
Inclined sealing surfaces are recommended to 
be ground Ra=0,8 μm and hardened at 45 HRC, 
when operating at peripheral speeds over 8 m/s. 
Lubricant outfl ow can be stopped by monting the 
rubbing seal with incorporated spring with the 
edge inwards (c) or outwards (d) if sealing has to 
prevent dust or ohter impurities from penetrating 
into the bearing.
Double sealing with these rubbing seals can 
also be used.
V-ring seal is used to prevent dust or 
contaminants from penetrating into the bearing 
with best results both in case of grease or oil 
lubrication. The elastic rubber lip of the V-ring 
seal is notched on the plane sealing surface, 
drawing the fl uids in centrifugal motion. V-ring 
seals are used at temperatures of -400C... +1000C, 
roughness of sealing surface being Ra = 1,5 - 3 
μm. Generally, at peripheral speeds up to 15 m/s, 
the V-ring seal operates as a rubbing seal (seal lip 
reaches sealing surface), and at peripheral speeds 
over 15 m/s the seal lip will lift from the sealing 
surface, operating as a centrifugal sealing.
V-ring seals can also be used in case of angular 
misalignments of the shaft (20... 30), as they are 
made of high quality, elastic rubber, easy to be 
mounted.
The effi  cacy of sealing depends on the fact that 
the ring body acts as a fl inger  for dirt and fl uids. 
Therefore, with grease lubrication the seal is 
generally arranged outside the housing and with 
oil lubrication it is placed inside the housing.
Pressed 
sheet 
washers 
provide 
simple, 
inexpensive and space - saving sealing especially 
for grease lubricated deep groove ball bearings. 
The washers are clamped against either the outer 
ring or the inner ring and exert a resilient pressure 
axially against the rubbing ring. In case of usual 
applications, the types of seals  mentioned above 
or their combinations shown in fi g. 4.9 are used, 
some of them becoming standard seals for rolling 
bearings (e.g. labyrinths, felt rings, V-rings etc.). 
Thus, better sealing can be obtained if felt ring 
(a) or V-ring (b) rubbing seals are combined with 
radial or axial labyrinth non-rubbing seals.
Special seals are used in case of unusual 
surroundings and loading conditions (e.g. 
rolling mills, helm of ocean-vessels, main shaft of 
grinding machines etc.)
Sealed bearings of the type 2RS (2RSR) (a) or 
shielded bearings of the type 2Z (2ZR) (b) shown 
in fi g. 4.10 a.b. provide simple and inexpresive 
sealing, with upper operating results. These 
rolling bearings are delivered ready greased, 
provision for relubrication and maintenance are 
not needed. They are used in case of bearings 
with small free space where other seals cannot 
be used.

---

64
Safe operating and long rating life of bearings 
depend on the lubricant type and quality and on 
the lubrication method. Bearing lubrication in 
used for certain purposes, such as:
-  to reduce friction between rolling elements 
and raceway, rolling elements and cage, cage 
and guiding ribs of rings during operation;
- to ensure anticorrosive protection of bearings;
- to reduce noise in bearing within certain limits;
-  to distribute heat uniformly in contact areas 
and to remove it outside through lubricant 
circulation.
Lubricants for bearings lubrication should 
satisfy the following conditions:
-  they should have physical and chemical 
stability;
-  foreign mechanical substances (abrasive, 
metallic substances etc.) are not admitted in 
lubricant;
-  they should have a minimal coeffi  cient of 
friction;
-  to be non-corrosive;
-  good unctuosity (lubricating capacity).
There are two categories of lubricants used for 
bearing lubrication:
-  fl uid lubricants (oils);
-  plastic lubricants (greases).
Table 5.1 shows comparison between fl uid and 
plastic lubricants.
Although 
fl uid 
lubricants 
have 
better 
characteristics than plastic lubricants, they cannot 
be used in all cases because of sealing diffi  culties.

Selection of lubricants
When selecting lubricants, much care is needed 
and all operating conditions and lubricant 
properties should be considered.
No lubrication system can be considered 
universal.
The most important criteria when selecting a 
lubricant have to be as follows:
- size of bearing
- speed
- load
- bearing operating temperature
These characteristic act upon lubricant viscosity 
as follows:
- the higher the bearing size, value of load and 
temperature, the higher the viscosity
- bearing speed acts by product Dm n, as show in 
table 5.2.

only when product Dm n≤ 500x103 and it off ers 
the following advantages:
Bearing lubrication

---

65
- it is more easily retained in the bearing;
-  it assures anti-corrosive protection to bearing 
as it is water-resistant;
- low expenses for sealing.
The grease quantity to be supplied shouldn’t 
be excesive, otherwise rotation is bracked, 
friction increases and also operating temperature 
without extending the bearing rating life.
The quantity of grease that is to be inserted in 
bearing seating should be as follows, considering 
the free space inside the housing:
-  1/2... 3/4 of the free space in the housing, in 
case of normal speeds;
-  1/3 of the free space in the housing, in case of 
high speeds and speed limit;
-  the whole housing space should be free, in 
case of low speeds and product Dm n < 10x103.
The quantity of grease can be calculated as 
a function of bearing bore diameter using the 
equation:
G = K d2.5  , g.
where:
K = 1/900 - for ball bearings
K = 1/350 - for roller bearings
d = bore diameter, mm
Relubrication intervals in most cases can be 
experimentally determined and depend on:
- bearing type
- bearing size
- operating temperature
- grease properties

of bearing type, bore diameter and speed.
Example:
A bearing 6208-2RSR is operated under reduced

From the diagram fi g. 5.1, the value of the relubrication 
interval will be of 13500 operating hours.
The grease quantity to be supplied can be 
determined using the equation:
G = K D B, g,
Scale a; deep groove ball bearings
Scale b; cylindrical roller bearings
Scale c; spherical roller bearings, thrust ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings without cage.

G =  grease quantity, g
K =  coeffi  cient depending on the relubrication 
interval, table 5.6
D = bearing outside diameter, mm
B =  total bearing width for radial bearings, mm and 
total bearing height for thrust bearings, mm
The chart in fi g. 5.1 applies to operating 
temperatures which do not exceed +70oC. For 
operating temperatures over +70oC, see table 5.4.
Grease service life can be defi ned as the 
period of time when it preserves physical and 
mechanical characteristics in time and oxidizing 
due to temperature and vaporization of base oil 
doesn’t occur.
A more accurate calculation of grease service life, 
considering grease quality and bearing operating 
conditions (load, size, speed, temperature etc.) 
can be done using the equation:
L = 10a-(m1 + m2 + m3)
where
L = service life, operating hours
a =  exponent depending on the grease quality 
(a = 5,8... 6,1)
m1... m3 =  exponents which take into account 
the following factors:
m1 = 4,4 x 10-6 Dm n,
m2 = 2,5 (P/C - 0,05),
m3 = (0,021 - 1,80 x 10-6 Dm n) t,
Dm = bearing mean diameter, mm
n = bearing speeds, r/min,
P = equivalent radial load, kN,
C = basic dynamic load, kN,
t = bearing operating temperature, 0C
When calculating the values of t, Dm n and P/C, 
the following have to be considered:
- when bearing operating temperature is lower 
than +500C, then t = +500C
- when speed factor Dm n < 125000, then Dm 
n = 125000
- when ratio P/C < 0,05, then P/C = 0,05

---

68
Grease service life, as a function of operating 
temperature can be approximately determined 
using the diagram fi g. 5.2.
Example 1
A bearing 6210 operates under a load Pr = 5 kN, 
speed n = 3000 r/min at an operating tempera-
ture t = 500C. What is the service life of the grease 
used for bearing lubrication?
Cr = 35,1 kN, tables on page 132. bearing 6210
L = 10a-(m1+m2+m3) = 106,1-2.273 = 6214 hours
a = 6,1, for Mobil grease,
Dm n = 65x3000 = 195x103
Pr/Cr = 5/35,1 = 0,143
m1 = 4,4 x 10-6 Dm n = 0,858
m2 = 2,5 (Pr/Cr - 0,05) = 0,23
m3 = (0,021 - 1,80 x 10-8 Dm n) 65 = 1,119
m1 + m2 + m3 = 2,273
Example 2
For the same bearing and operating conditions 
as in Example 1, it is required to fi nd the service 
life of the same grease at a temperature of 
t = 95oC.
m3 = 1,66
m1 + m2 + m3 = 2,794
L =  106,1-2,794 = 103,306 = 1774 operating hours
From the diagram fi g. 5.2, we can fi nd 
approximately the same value, respectively 6000 
operating hours at + 650C and 1700 operating 
hours at +950C.
Table 5.7 shows technical characteristics of usual 
grease, which are recommended for lubrication 
of sealed and shielded bearings, 2RS and 2Z types 
and also for rolling bearings in various assemblied 
and machines.

Oil lubrication
Oil lubrication can be used in any operating 
condition, but this kind of lubrication is 
compulsory when the value of the product Dm 
n  from table 5.2 is exceeded for grease, namely 
Dm n>500 x 103 and when high temperatures 
occur in bearing. Then, oil has to lubricate and to 
remove heat from bearing.
Oils used for bearing lubrication can be:
-  mineral oils, used up to a temperature of 
+1500C.
-  synthetic oils, used up to a temperature of 
+2200C.
For a proper lubrication of bearings, low 
quantities of lubricants to reach the rolling 
elements are needed.
The lubricating systems must provide oil 
quantity necessary to prevent oil draining from 
bearing and heat removal in case of high speeds.
Most usual oil lubricating systems depending 
on factor Dm n are given in tables 5.8.

Diagram fi g. 5.7 shows kinematic viscosity 
classes at 400C in accordance with ISO, its variation 
depending on the operating temperature (t0C) 
in relation to speed and bearing mean diameter 
(Dm).
Example
A bearing 6204 is to operate under a speed n = 
2 000 r/min at a temperature t = +650C. Dm = 0,5 
(d+D) = 35,5 mm.
The viscosity of the oil for bearing lubrication is 
required.
From the diagram, for Dm = 35,5 mm, we can 
fi nd viscosity at +650C,  ν1 = 13 cSt and viscosity 
at + 400C, ν = 32cSt.
Table 5.10 shows oils which are recommended 
by ISO for bearing lubrication. Values of kinematic 
viscosity at +400C, mm2/s are also given.

The purpose of designation is that of 
identifi cation of bearings, so that bearings with 
the same designation to be interchangeable both 
dimensionally and operationally, no matter who 
the producers may be. Designation of URB rolling 
bearings are in accordance with those used by 
The 
basic 
designation 
consists 
of 
an 
identifi cation of the type of bearing (fi gure or 
letter), the series designation, in accordance with 
ISO and the bore diameter identifi cation.
The designation of the bearing type and 
dimension series, for main standardized bearing 
types, are given in table 6.1.
Bore diameter identifi cation consist of one, two 
or  more fi gures as follows:
-  bore diameter 
- one fi gure, representing 
from 1 to 9 mm 
the 
bore 
diameter 

(e.g. 623, 608);
- bore diameter 
- two fi gures, as follows: 
from 10 to 495 mm 
00 for 10 mm, 01 for 12 

mm, 02 for 15 mm, 03 for 

17 mm, 04 and up to 

99 
for 
bore 
diameter 

from 20 to 495 mm. 

(bore diameter = bore 

diameter identifi cation x 5, 

e.g. 6230, d = 150 mm);
world-know bearing companies: SKF, GAF, INA, 
KOYO etc.
The completedesignation of a bearing consists 
of a basic design and may include one or more 
supplementary 
designations 
(prefi xes 
and 
suffi  xes), as shown in chart fi g. 6.1.

etc. 
(e.g.

6310P53, 
NU210SO, 7010CDB).
These suffi  xes for bearing designation are listed 
considering the groups they belong to, at the 
beginning of each bearing group.

74
Proper operation of rolling bearings is also 
determined by a proper selection of the solution 
of mounting and dismounting, considering the 
type and size of bearing, fi t, adequate tools for 
these operations, performance etc.
As being precision components, rolling bearings 
should be handled carefully when storing or 
monting. Thus, the following conditions should 
be observed:
- storing in their original package, on 
special shelves, in dry room, temperature of 
+180C...+200C, maximum moisture degree of 60%
- 
handling 
bearings, 
while 
storing 
and 
mounting, should be carrefully done so that 
original package to be preotected and not to be 
deteriorated.
- bearings should be unpacked only when they 
are to be mounted.
They shouldn’t be washed if original package 
hasn’t been destroyed.
- as the adjoint parts of bearing are accurate, 
without burrs, chips or hits, special care should 
be taken.
Mounting of bearings with 
cylindrical bore
Bearings with cylindrical bore which are to have 
tight fi t on shaft on in housing respectively, will 
be mounted by mechanical, thermic or hydraulic 
means.
The pressing force should be transmitted only by 
the ring which is pressed on the shaft or into the 
housing bore. Transmission by rolling bearings 
should be avoided as they can get defromed and 
premature damage can occur.
Special sleeves with one or two ribs, fi g. 7.1, 
a and b are used when mounting small and 
medium-sized bearings, which are to be mounted 
with transition fi t. In case of self-aligning ball 
bearings or spherical roller thrust bearings, a 
plate is mounted for a proper location of the 
outer rings, as shown in fi g. 7.2.
Mechanical or hydraulic presses are used as 
shown in fi g. 7.3, in case of serial production so 
that force can be continuously and gradually 
applied.
For the mounting of bearings with clearance 
fi t into the housing or on the shaft, the ring with 
transition or tight fi t should be mounted fi rst, 
after which the shaft-bearing assenbly will be 
mounted into the housing as shown in fi g. 7.4, a 
and b.
In case of dismountable bearings, rings can be 
mounted separately - fi g. 7.5, even if an tight fi t is 
required for both rings.
Mounting and dismounting

75
For the bearings heating, oil bath, electric range, 
heating device with thermic ring or induction 
heating device etc. can be used as shown in fi g. 
7.6, a-d.
The device with thermic ring - fi g. 7.6 c consists of 
a split aluminium ring with three grips and cuts 
which make it be elastic.
Thermic ring bore diameter is equal to inner 
ring raceway diameter of dismountable bearings.
The ring outside diameter can be calculated 
using the equation:
D
4d
3d , mm
ex
1
2
2
=
-
where:
Dex = outside diameter of the thermic ring,
d1 = diameter of the inner ring raceway, mm
d = bearing bore diameter, mm
The mounting of medium (d > 50 mm) and 
large-sized bearings with tight fi t, requires much 
greater pressing forces. That’s why in this case 
heating of bearings up to +800C...+1100C should 
be used instead of pressing, excepting shielded 
bearings, 2Z (2ZR) type and sealed bearings, 2RS 
(2RSR) type.

---

76
The weight of the thermic ring is approximately 
equal to the weight of the bearing inner ring.
In case of large-sized cylindrical roller bearings, 
heating is done with induction  devices. These 
devices consist of a coil inductor, thermal relays 
for temperature adjustment and timers. 380 V 
voltage and 50 - 60 Hz frequency inductors are 
used for bearings with bore diameter up to 200 
mm. For larger-sized bearings, 20... 40 V voltage 
and 50 - 60 Hz inductors are used.
This device is schematically shown in fi g. 7.6.d.
Mounting of bearings with 
tapered bore
Tapered bore bearings can be mounted directly 
on the shaft, on adapter sleeve or withdrawal 
sleeve. These bearings should always be mounted 
only with a tight fi t. The tight fi t can be done by 
an axial displacement of the bearing inner ring 
which is mounted directly on the tapered spindle 
of the shaft or by an axial disaplacement of the 
adapter or withdrawal sleeve.
The values of reduction in radial clearance 
are given in tables 7.1 and 7.2, as function of 
axial displacement on shaft of self-aligning ball 
bearings and spherical roller thrust bearings. 
After mounting the initial radial clearance is to be 
considered.
After mounting, radial clearance of radial and 
self-aligning ball bearings are in accordance with 
table 7.1.
The values of tightening are estimated by the 
values of the radial clearance reduction or of axial 
displacement. Axial displacement of the mounted 
bearings is measured by means of a limit gauge, 
as shown in fi g. 7.7, a and b. The thickness of the 
limit gauge can be calculated from:
m = S - a
where:
m = thickness of the limit gauge, mm
S = distance initially measured, mm
a = axial displacement, from table 7.1, mm
Example
A bearing 22252, d = 260 mm, taper: 1:12, distance s = 10 
mm, distance “a“ from table 7.1 = 1,90 mm, m = 10 - 1,9 = 
8,10 mm
Small-sized bearings with tapered bore which 
are to be mounted directly on the shaft or with 
adapter or withdrawal sleeves can be axially 
displaced by means of a nut as shown in fi g. 7.8, 
a, or by means of a special sleeve as in fi g. 7.8 b,c.
Medium-sized bearings can be axially displaced 
by means of a special nut as shown in fi g. 7.9 and 
some screws. Then, the nut is to be dismounted 
and replaced with a nut for axial fastening.
Special hydraulic presses - fi g. 7.11 are used to 
mount medium and large-sized bearings.
To reduce the bearing displacing force in case 
of large-sized bearings, pressurized oil is to be 
introduced between the tapered surfaces of the 
shaft spindle, bearing and b, by means of an oil 
pump - fi g. 7.10 or oil injector - fi g. 7.12. 
One or more grooves, should be provided 
as shown in fi g. 7.13, a and b so that oil can be 
distributed between the mounting surfaces.

Bearing dismounting
When bearings with tapered bore are to be 
dismounted from the shaft or housing, the 
succession of operations is inversely done than in 
case of mounting.
Thus, the assembly mounted with clearance fi t 
or small tightening is to be dismounted fi rst and 
then the parts mounted with greater tightening, 
as shown in fi g. 7.14 and fi g. 7.15.
To use mechanical or hydraulic instruments, 
when dismounting bearings, a special design of 
the shaft and housing is required, as shown in fi g. 
7.16, a-c: withdrawal grooves (a) and (b), threaded 
bores (c), grooves for oil distribution, fi g. 7.13.

---

79
Medium and small-sized bearings which are 
mounted with an tight fi t are dismounted from 
the shaft by means of a soft steel or copper 
mandrel or by means of mechanical or hydraulic 
presses - fi g. 7.17, a-c.
To reduce the frictional force when dismounting 
largesized bearings which were mounted on 
shaft with tight fi t, pressurized oil should be 
introduced, as in case of mounting - fi g. 7.11.
To dismount bearings with tapered bore which 
were mounted directly on the shaft or bearings 
which were mounted with withdrawal or adapter 
sleeves, the nut axially fastened should be fi rst 
stripped. Then, dismounting is to be done by light 
hammering on the inner ring by means of a soft 
steel or copper mandrel, as shown in fi g. 7,18 a 
and b.
In case of bearings mounted with withdrawal 
sleeves, a nut is to be screwed up to the threaded 
part provided for this purpose, as shown in fi g. 
7.19, a and b.
In case of large-sized bearings, hydraulic devices 
are used as in case of mounting.
Some solutions for dismounting bearings with 
tapered bore mounted direclty on the shaft 
spindle, with adapter or withdrawal sleeve are 
given in fi g. 7.20, a and b.

Deep groove ball bearing
Deep groove ball bearings are manufactured in 
a varied range, both of standard design and various 
constructive versions.
Deep groove ball bearings can take double 
direction radial and axial loads and also allow good 
operation at high speeds.
For these reasons, they can be widely used. 
Therefor, single row deep groove ball bearings are 
manufactured in many constructive versions as 
shown below.
Besides deep groove ball bearings of basic design, 
bearings with UG design, with grooves on the outer 
ring and WL design, with grooves on both rings 
are also used for the purpose of mounting seals or 
shields on the bearings. 2ZR, 2RSR or 2RS type, as 
shown in the bellow fi gure.

Sealed and shielded
deep groove ball bearings
URB manufactures two versions of sealed and 
shielded bearings, namely:
- bearings RS and Z type, with recess on the inner 
ring for sealing or shielding.
- bearings RSR and ZR type, when shielding and 
sealing respectively are done directly on the outside 
surface of the inner ring.
In case of bearings with non-rubbing shields, 
there is a small interstice between the shield and the 
rib of the inner ring; in case of bearings with seals, 
the gasoline and oil resistant elastic rubber lip rubs 
on the groove on the inner ring side or directly on 
the outside surface.
Bearings sealed and shielded on both sides 
manufactured in series are delivered fi lled with 
lithium base grease and used at temperatures 
between -30ºC and +110ºC, in accordance with 
the specifi cations in chapter 5. Bearings can also 
be greased with special greases, relubrication not 
being necessary. Washing or heating are not allowed 
before bearing mounting in the assembly.
Bearings with shields have been designed fi rst of 
all for cases when the inner ring rotates.
When the outer ring rotates, the lubricant can fl ow 
out of the bearing at a certain speed. In such cases, 
we recommend you to consult our experts.
Deep grooveball bearings with the 
snap ring groove
Deep groove ball bearings, with snap ring 
groove on the outer ring can be located in the 
housing with snap rings.
Because of their simple and space saving 
mounting, these bearings simplify the assembly 
design. The groove for the snap ring and the snap 
rings are in accordance with ISO 464 and tables 7 
and 8 respectively.
Paired deep groove ball bearings
If the basic load of a single bearing is inadequate 
or the shaft has to be axially located in both 
directions with a certain clearance, paired deep 
groove ball bearings are recommended to be 
used.
These bearings can be delivered matched in 
pairs in three versions, as follows: DT (tandem 
arrangement), DB (back-to-back arrangement) 
or DF (face-to-face arrangement). They can be 
delivered with axial clearance or preloaded. The 
values of clearance or preload are given in table 2.
The producer marks "V" on the bearing outside 
surface as shown in the next fi gure, so that pired 
bearings to be correctly mounted.
The multiple speed limit of these bearings can 
be calculated multiplying the speed of the basic 
bearing by 0,8.
Paired bearings are packed and delivered in the 
same box.
Stainless steel deep groove ball 
bearings
Deep groove ball bearings can be made and 
constructive version of stainless steel.

Dimensions
The overall dimensions of deep groove ball 
bearings are in accordance with the stipulations 
of ISO 15.
Misalignments
Deep groove ball bearings have limited abilities 
to compensate for bearing error of alignment. 
The permissible misalignment between the outer 
ring and the inner ring, which will not produce 
inadmissible high additional loads in the bearing, 
depends on the bearing size, operational radial 
clearance, inner bearing design and also on the 
magnitude of loads and moments acting upon 
the bearing.
Because of the complex relationship of these 
infl uence factors, defi nite and universally valid 
values of permissible misalignment cannot be 
determined.
Considering the above mentioned factors, under 
normal operation conditions the permissible 
misalignments are between 2 and 10 minutes of 
arc, depending on the bearing series and load.
Tolerances
Deep groove ball bearings are generally 
manufactured to the normal tolerance class P0.
At request, they can also be manufactured to 
the tolerance classes P6, P5 or P4.
The values of tolerances are given in chapter 3 
on page 24.
Radial and axial clearance
Deep groove ball bearings are generally 
manufactured with normal radial clearance. At 
request, they can also be manufactured with 
radial clearance diff erent from the normal one, 
according to ISO 5753. The values of radial 
clearance are given in table 1.
Paired bearings can be manufactured with 
axial clearance (suffi  x A) or preloaded (suffi  x L). 
Values for axial clearance and preload are given in 
table 2.
If a certain axial clearance is prescribed, this has 
to be measured and marked on the bearing by "A", 
followed by clearance actual value.

Cages
Deep groove ball bearings are generally fi tted 
with cages of pressed steel sheet.
Cages of glass fi bre reinforced polyamide 6.6 are 
also suitable if the operating temperature doesn't 
exceed +120ºC. They have reduced weight, 
low coeffi  cient of friction and are noiseless in 
operation. Large-sized bearings are fi tted with 
machined brass cages.
Cage design and some technical data are given 
in table 3.
Bearing minimum radial load
A minimum load must be applied on a deep 
groove ball bearing so that they can operate 
correctly, especially in case of operating under 
heavy loads.
The forces of inertia which occur in bearing 
as well as the friction in lubricant infl uence 
negatively the operating conditions and can 
cause detrimental sliding movements between 
balls and raceways.

---

85
Minimum radial load depends on the bearing 
size, speed and lubricant viscosity at operating 
temperature. It can be roughly calculated from 
the equation:
F 
r min = 0,01 Cr, (Cr = basic dynamic radial load).
Equivalent dynamic radial load
Deep groove ball bearing can take also radial 
and axial combined loads.
For deep groove ball bearings, single or paired 
in tandem arrangement DT, equivalent dynamic 
radial load can be calculated using the equation:
Pr = Fr , kN, when Fa/Fr <e
Pr = XFr+YFa, when Fa/Fr>e
The greater the axial load, the greater the 
contact angle of these bearings.
Factor e, X and Y depend on the ratio f0Fa/C0r. 
Factor f0 can be determined using the diagram 
in the bellow fi gure, as a function of dimension 
series and mean diameter (d+D)/2. Fa is the axial 
and C0r is the static basic load of the bearing.
The values of factors e, X, Y which depend on 
the bearing clearance can be determined from 
table 4, coresponding to the values of the ratio 
f0Fa/C0r. The values in table 4 apply to bearings 
mounted with normal fi t, i.e. shaft manufactured 
to tolerance class j5 or k5 and housing in J6, 
respectively.

---

86
For bearings matched in DB or DT arrangement, 
equvalent dynamic radial load can be calculated 
using the equation:
Pr=Fr+Y1Fa, kN when Fa/Fe <e
Pr= 0,75Fr + Y2Fa, kN when F1/Fr>e.
The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2, as functions of 
ratio Fa/C0r are given in table 5.
Equivalent static radial load
For deep groove ball bearings, single or 
matched in tandem (DT), equivalent static load 
can be calculated using the equations:
P0 = Fr, kN, when Fa/Fr<0,8
P0 = 0,6Fr+0,5 Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr>0,8
For bearings matched in DB or DF arrangement, 
it can be calculated from
P0 = Fr+1,7 Fa, kN.
Axial load
If deep groove ball bearings are purelz axial 
loaded, the axial load should not exceed 0,5 C0r, In 
case of small-sized bearings and bearings of light 
series (diameter series 8, 9, 0 and 1), the axial load 
should not exceed 0,25 C0r.
Heavy axial loads cause a signifi cant decrease of 
bearing rating life. In such cases, we recommend 
you to consult our experts

Deep groove ball bearing 
DIN 625
General
URB produce small and medium sized deep 
groove ball bearing, including thin section bearing 
in stainless steel.
These bearing have rings and balls made from 
high - chromium alloy stainless steel.
The cage material for bearings with pressed cages 
is also stainless steel.
The URB stainless steel bearings feature similar 
load ratings as the standard bearings made from 
normal bearing steel.
URB Stainless steel bearings are resistant to 
humidity, water, steam and many alkaline solutions.
The resistance to acids, however, is limited. It is 
dependant upon the individual operating conditions 
(i.e. acid concentration and its temperature).
In some applications, using sealed stainless steel 
bearings also the resistance of the lubricant used 
and the seal material must be considered.
Design variants
URB stainless steel deep groove ball bearings 
are standard open design.
Sealed (suffi  xes RSR or .2RSR) or Shield versions 
(suffi  x ZR or .2ZR) are also produced to order request.

Stainless Steel Series
Tolerances
URB stainless steel deep groove ball bearings are 
produced to normal tolerance class (PN) as standard.
The dimensional tolerance values are listed in the 
chapter “Bearing tolerances” on page 27.
Cages
URB stainless steel deep groove ball bearings 
are fi tted with pressed stainless steel cages are 
standard.
There are several bearing types, cage designs and 
materials available on request.
Internal clearance
The URB range of stainless steel deep groove 
ball bearings are produced with normal internal 
clearance (CN) as standard.
Other internal clearance groups may be produced 
upon request (i.e. C2 or C3 etc).
The values of internal clearance groups are as for 
standard deep groove ball bearings according to DIN 
620/part 4 and ISO 5753-1981, respectively.
Designation
URB - Stainless Steel Deep groove ball bearing 
are identifi ed by a prefi x “SS” (SS stands for “Stainless 
Steel”).

Designs
A single row deep groove ball bearing with fi lling 
slots has a fi lling slot in both the inner and outer 
rings (fi g. 1) enabling more and larger balls to be 
incorporated than in standard deep groove ball 
bearings. Filling slot bearings have a higher radial 
load carrying capacity than bearings without fi lling 
slots, but their axial load carrying capacity is small. 
They are also unable to operate at such high speeds 
as bearings without fi lling slots.
The standard assortment of URB deep groove ball 
bearings with fi lling slots comprises
• basic design open bearings
• shielded bearings
• bearings with a snap ring groove.
Basic design bearings
Basic design bearings with fi lling slots are open. 
Those bearings that are also produced in shielded 
version may have seal recesses in the outer ring, for 
manufacturing reason (fi g. 2).
Shielded bearings
URB deep groove ball bearings with fi lling slots 
are available with shields on one or both sides, 
designation suffi  xes ZR or 2ZR. The shield forms a 
narrow gap to the inner ring shoulder (fi g. 3).
Bearings up to and including sizes 217 and 314 
are fi lled with a high-quality NLGI class 2 grease with 
polyurea thickener, for a temperature range of -30 °C 
to +150°C. The base oil viscosity is 115 mm2/s at 40 °C 
and 9,4 mm2/s at 100 °C.
The quantity of grease fi lls some 25 to 35% of the 
free space in the bearing. The bearings are lubricated 
for life and are maintenance-free. They should 
therefore not be washed or heated above 80°C 
before mounting.
Single Row Deep Groove Ball Bearing - 
with fi lling slots
Bearings with a snap ring groove
For easy, space saving axial location of the bearing 
in the housing, URB deep groove ball bearings with 
fi lling slots are available with a snap ring groove 
in the outer ring, designation suffi  x N (fi g. 4a). The 
appropriate snap ring is shown in the product 
table with designation and dimensions and may 
be supplied separately or already mounted on the 
bearing, designation suffi  x NR (fi g. 4b). URB deep 
groove ball bearings with fi lling slots and a snap ring 
groove can also be supplied with a shield on the side 
opposite the snap ring groove (fi g. 5a) or with two 
shields (fi g. 5b).
Bearing data - general
Dimensions
The boundary dimensions of URB deep groove 
ball bearings with fi lling slots are in accordance with 
ISO 15:1998.
The dimensions of the snap ring groove and snap 
rings follow ISO 464:1995.
Tolerances
URB deep groove ball bearings with fi lling slots 
are produced to Normal tolerances. The tolerances 
are in accordance with ISO 492:2002 and can be 
found in table 3.1/3.2 on page 27.
Internal clearance
URB single row deep groove ball bearings with 
fi lling slots are manufactured with Normal radial 
internal clearance. The values for radial internal 
clearance are provided in tab. 1 on pag. 83. They are 
in accordance with ISO 5753:1991 and are valid for 
unmounted bearings under zero  measuring load.

---

124
Misalignment
The conditions concerning misalignment of the 
outer ring with respect to the inner ring are the same 
for deep groove ball bearings. However, the fi lling 
slots limit the angular misalignment may lead to 
the balls running over the edges of the fi lling slot. 
This will cause increased bearing noise and reduced 
bearing service life.
Cages
URB deep groove ball bearings with fi lling slots 
are fi tted with a pressed riveted steel cage, ball 
centred, no designation suffi  x (fi g. 6).
Minimum load
In order to provide satisfactory operation, deep 
groove ball bearings with fi lling slots, like all ball 
and roller bearings, must always be subjected to 
a given minimum load, particularly if they are to 
operate at high speeds or are subjected to high 
accelerations or rapid changes in the direction of 
load. Under such conditions, the inertia forces of the 
balls and cage, and friction in the lubricant, can have 
a detrimental infl uence on the rolling conditions in 
the bearing arrangement and may cause damaging 
sliding movements to occur between the balls and 
raceways.
The requisite minimum radial load to be applied 
to deep groove ball bearings with fi lling slots can be 
eatimated using

ν

n

dm

When starting up at low temperatures or 
when the lubricant is highly viscous, even greater 
minimum loads may be required. The weight of the 
components supported by the bearing, together 
with external forces, generally exceeds the requisite 
minimum load. If this is not the case, the deep groove 
ball bearing must be subjected to on additional 
radial load.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
P = Fr + Fa
provided Fa/Fr≤0,6 and P≤0,5 C0.
If the axial load Fa>0,6 Fr then deep groove ball 
bearings without fi lling slots should be used instead.
Equivalent static bearing load
P0=Fr + 0,5 Fa
provided Fa/Fr≤0,6.

Deep groove ball bearing 
DIN 625
General
Double Row Deep groove ball bearings feature 
higher load ratings when compared to single row 
bearings.
This two row bearing gives a very rigid 
arrangement, but they are very sensitive to 
misalignments.
Tolerances
URB Double Row Deep groove bearings are 
produced in normal tolerance class (PN) as standard.
Double Row Deep Groove Ball Bearing
Internal clearance
URB Double Row Deep groove ball bearings are 
produced with normal internal clearance, (CN) as 
standard. Other internal clearance groups may be 
produced upon request.
Design variants, Cages
URB Double Row Deep groove ball bearings 
have the latest design (suffi  x B) without fi lling slots.
Thus they are able to support thrust loads equally 
well in both directions. These bearings are fi tted with 
polyamide cages, (suffi  x TN) as standard.
These bearing sizes are also available with 
pressed steel cages.
But, it must be considered that some of these 
bearings may have fi lling slots which limit the ability 
to support thrust loads in the direction of these 
fi lling slots.

Self-aligning ball bearings have a common 
sphered raceway in the outer ring. This feature 
allows angular misalignment of the shaft relative 
to the housing. Therefore self-aligning ball 
bearings are particularly used in case of bearings 
where misalignment can occur from errors in 
mounting or from shaft bending.

Sealed self-aligning ball bearings
Self aligning ball bearings are also available 
in a sealed version with seals at both sides. The 
seals are made of gasoline, oil and wear-resistant 
synthetic ruber. Sealed bearings are delivered 
fi lled with a certain grease quantity. Sealed 
bearing operating temperatures are between 
-300C and +800C. Grease sevice life is much 
Self-aligning ball bearings
Double row self-aligning ball bearings are 
manufactured both with cylindrical bore and 
tapered bore (taper 1:12). Self-aligning bearings 
with tapered bore can be delivered, at request, 
with adapter sleeves.
reduced if bearing operates at a temperature 
higher than  +800C (see page 64).
Sealed bearings are greased for the entire 
operating 
period, 
relubrication 
not 
being 
necessary. Sealed bearings washing or heating 
before mounting in assembly is not allowed.
Self -aligning ball bearings with 
extended inner ring
Self -aligning ball bearings with extended inner 
ring of series 112 and 113 are used in applications 
where high accuracy is not necessary and 
generally, they can be mounted directly on rolled 
shafts. The bore manufactured to tolerance class 
J7 allows fast mounting and dismounting. The 
inner ring has a groove for bearing axial location 
which can be done by means of a screw or pin.
Dimensions
Overall dimensions of self-aligning ball bearings 
are in accordance with ISO 15.

Misalignment
Self-aligning ball bearings allow within certain 
limits an angular misalignement of the outer ring 
in relation to the inner ring, without detrimental 
eff ects in bearing unit.
Approximate 
values 
for 
permissible 
misalignment, 
under

Tolerances and radial clearance
Bearings of serial production are manufactured 
to normal tolerance class and with normal 
radial clearance. Tapered bore bearings of serial 
production are also manufactured with radial 
clearance  C3.
Self-aligning ball bearings with extended inner 
ring are manufactured with radial clearance C2 
and normal clearance.
At request, these bearings can also be 
manufactured to other tolerance classes and with 
smaller or larger radial clearance.
The bore of self-aligning ball bearings with 
extended inner ring is manufactured to tolerance 
class J7.
Bearing tolerances are given on page  24 and 
the values of radial clearance are given in tables 
2 and 3.

Equivalent dynamic radial load
Pr = Fr + Y1 Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr ≤e,
Pr = 0,65 Fr + Y2 Fa, kN 
when Fa/Fr >e,
The values of factors e, Y1 and Y2 which depend 
on bearings are given in bearing tables.
Equivalent static radial load
P0r = Fr + Y0 Fa, kN
The values of the factor Y0 which depends on 
bearing are given in bearing tables.
Axial load on bearings with adapter 
sleeves
If self-aligning ball bearings are mounted with 
adapter sleeves on smooth shafts, without side 
location, their axial carryng capacity depends on 
the friction between the sleeve bore and shaft.
Permissible axial load can be precisely enough 
determined using the equation:
Fa max = 3 B d,
where:
Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, N
B - bearing width, mm
d - bearing bore diameter, mm
Cages
Self-aligning ball bearings are generally fi tted 
with presses cages of sheet. At special request, 
when bearings operate under fl uctuating loads, 
at high speeds and where large sizes are required, 
machined brass cages are recommended to be 
used. Glass fi bre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages 
are also suitable if the operating temperatures 
do not exceed +1200C. They have low weight, a 
low coeffi  cient of friction and are noiseless while 
running.
Cage design and technical data are given in 
table 4.

Special characteristics
In case of some dimensions of self-aligning 
ball bearings series 12 and 13, the balls protrude 
somewhat from the bearing, as shown in the 
adjacent design and table. This should be 
considered both by designer and user.

Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on 
the shaft shoulder and housing shoulder 
respectively, maximum connection radius ru max. 
of shaft (housing) should be less than minimum 
mounting chamfer rs min of bearing.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized 
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
In case of self-aligning ball bearings with 
tapered bore which are mounted directly on a 
tapered shaft or with an adapter sleeve, proper 
tightening and minimum radial clearance of 10-
20 μm should be assured for normal clearance 
and of 20-55 μm for clearance C3, depending 
on bearing size and series. The values of the 
connection radius and support shoulder height 
are given in table 6 and mounting dimensions for 
bearings mounted with adapter sleeves are given 
in table 7.

Single row angular contact bearings are 
manufactured in various constructive versions, 
with various contact angles, depending on the 
application. Bearings series 72B and 73B for 
general applications have a contact agle α= 40°. 
Bearings series 718, 719, 70 and 72 generally used 
Angular contact ball bearings, 
single row
for tool-holders, have phenol resins (textolite) 
cages or machined brass cages. Those with bore 
diameters up to d = 100 mm are manufactured 
to tolerance classes P5, P4 and P2 and have a 
contact angle of 15°(C) and 25°(A) respectively.

Single row angular contact ball bearings can 
take only one direction axial loads. When being 
radially loaded, in bearing occurs an axially acting 
load which has to be compensated.
For this reason, a bearing or paired bearings are 
mounted on each shaft end.
Single row angular contact ball bearings with B 
suffi  x have a contact angle α= 40° and are suitable 
in case of heavy loads.
These bearings are not dismountable and their 
use at relatively high speeds is allowed.
Pair mounting of bearings as shown in fi gures 
on page 155 is used when the load carryng 
capacity of a sigle bearing is inadequate (tandem 
arrangement), respectively when axial loads 
have to be taken in both directions (DB or DF 
arrangements).
In case of DT tandem arrangement, the contact 
lines are in parallel. Radial and axial loads are 
uniformly distributed on both bearings. The 
bearing pair can take axial loads in only one 
direction. Therefore, a thirs bearing should take 
axial loads in the opposite direction.
DB arrangement is considered to be a relatively 
stiff  arrangement and can also take tilting 
moments.
The contact lines of DF arrangement converge 
towards the bearing axis and form letter “X“. Axial 
loads are taken in the same way as in case of DB 
arrangement, but the arrangement is not so stiff  
and it is less suitable for taking tilting moments.
Universal design
Single row angular contact ball bearings of 
universal design are suitable for DB, DF and DT 
arrangements.
Bearings of universal design are manufactured

to more accurate tolerance classes and can be 
matched if the mounting conditions UA, UO and 
UL are observed.
The values of clearance or preload are obtained 
when the shaft is manufactured to tolerance class 
J5 and the housing bore to tolerance class J6.
Dimensions
Main dimensions of bearings given in tables are 
in accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
In case of single row angular contact ball 
bearings the conditions regarding the permissible 
error of alignment of the outer ring relative to the 
inner ring are as complex as for single row deep 
groove ball bearings.
When 
the 
bearings 
are 
paired 
in 
DB 
arrangement, angular misalignments of the 
outer ring in relation to the inner ring can only be 
accommodated between the balls and raceways 
by force, leading to a reduction in bearing life.
Tolerances
Single row angular contact ball bearings of 
series 72B and 73B, with a contact angle α= 40° 
(B) are generally manufactured to the normal 
tolerance class.
At request, they also can be manufactured to 
normal tolerance classes P6 and P5.
Single row angular contact ball bearings of 
high accuracy, series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A, 
with a contact angle α= 15° (C) and α= 25° are 
manufactured to tolerance classes SP, P4, UP 
and P2.
The deviations of bore diameter, outside 
diameter and width of high accuracy single row 
angular contact ball bearings of universal design 
(UL) are given in table 1.
In case of single row angular contact ball 
bearings manufactured and delivered in sets of 2, 
3 or 4 bearings, outside and bore diameter should 
be chosen considering the mean tolerance values, 
which are given on the package.
Contact angle
In case of single row angular contact ball 
bearings, the eff orts between rings and rolling 
elements (contact points of rolling elements / 
outer or inner ring) are transmitted at an angle 
α (<90°) to a plane perpendicular to the bearing 
axis.
The value of this angle depends on the 
magnitude of the raceway radius, rolling element 
diameter and radial clearance in bearing, when 
the curvature centres of the raceway in the outer 
or in the inner ring are in the same plane.
The contact angle α can be calculated and 
verified in accordance with the specifications on 
page 150.
High accuracy single row angular contact 
ball bearings series 70C, 70A and 72A, with a 
contact angle α = 15° (C) and α = 25° (A), which 
are generally used for grinding stone holders, 
paired mounted in DB and DF arrangement, are 
manufactured with an initial preload. It can be: 
light (L), moderate (M), heavly (S). The values of 
these preloads are given in table 3.

Axial clearance - preload
Axial clearance or preload can be obtained only 
when single row angular contact ball bearings is 
mounted in the assembly and depends on the 
location of the second bearing which assures the 
shaft axial guiding.
Single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B, paired mounted in DB and DF 
arrangements are manufactured with normal 
axial clearance CB, smaller than normal, CA, 
larger than normal, CC, or with light preload, 
GA, moderate preload GB, or heavy preload, GC, 
according to the values given in table 2.
High accuracy single row angular contact 
ball bearings series 70C, 70A and 72A, with a 
contact angle α = 15° (C) and α = 25° (A), which 
are generally used for grinding stone holders, 
paired mounted in DB and DF arrangement, are 
manufactured with an initial preload. It can be: 
light (L), moderate (M), heavy (S). The values of 
these preloads are given in table 3.

Designs of single row angular contact ball 
bearings with clearance or initial preload are 
given in the fi gures below.
Cages
Single row angular contact ball bearings series 
72B and 73B are generally fi tted with pressed 
sheet cages.
High precision single row angular contact ball 
bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A are fi tted 
with textolite cages (textile fi bre reinforced 
phenol resins).
At special request (high speeds, large sizes), 
bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A are fi tted 
with machined brass cages. Cages of glass fi bre 
reinforced polyamide 6.6 are also used with good 
results if operating temperature doesn’t exceed 
+120°C.
Cages design and some technical data are given 
in table 4

Equivalent dynamic radial load
For single row angular contact ball bearings 
series 72B and 73B, single and in tandem 
arrangement the following equations are used:
Pr = Fr , kN, 
when Fa/Fr ≤ 1,14,
Pr = 0,35 Fr + 0,57 Fa , kN, when Fa/Fr > 1,14
For bearings in DB or DF arrangement
Pr = Fr  + 0,65 Fa , kN 
when Fa/Fr ≤ 1,14
Pr = 0,57 Fr + 0,93 Fa , kN, when Fa/Fr > 1,14
In case of paired bearings, Fr and Fa are the loads 
acting upon the bearings pair.
As the load is transmitted from one raceway to 
the other under a certain angle to the bearings 
axis, the actual load will cause an axial load. 
This has to be considered when calculating the 
equivalent dynamic load, in case of two single 
bearings or tandem arrangements. The equations 
needed for calculation are given in table 5, for 
various arrangements and loading versions.
These equations are available for bearings 
mounted without clearance and without preload 
(clearance equal to zero).
For single row angular contact ball bearings 
series 70C and 72C with a contact angle α = 
15°(C), single or in DT arrangement, the following 
equations are available:
Pr = Fr , kN, 
for Fa/Fr ≤ e,
Pr = 0,44 Fr + Y Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr > e
The values of factor Y depend on the values 
of the ratio f0 i Fa/C0r and are given in table 6. 
Factor f0 can be found  in diagram in page 162 as 
a funtion of dimensions series and bearing mean 
diameter. “i“ represents the number of bearings or 
bearings pairs in a bearing join.
For bearings in DB and DF arrangements, the 
following equations are available:
Pr = Fr  + Y1 Fa, kN, 
for Fa/Fr ≤ e,
Pr = 0,72 Fr + Y2 Fa , kN, 
for Fa/Fr > e
The values of factors Y1 and Y2 depend on the 
ratio f0iFa/C0r and are given in table 6 (f0 from 
diagram below).

Equivalent static load
For single row angular contact ball bearings 
series 72B and 73B with a contact angle α = 40°, 
single and in DT arrangement, the following 
equation is available:
P0r = 0,6 Fr  + 0,26 Fa , kN
If P0r < Fr, then we consider P0 = Fr
For bearings in DB and DT arrangement, the 
following equation is available:
P0r = Fr  + 0,52 Fa , kN
For single row angular contact ball bearings 
series 70C and 72C, with a contact angle 
α = 15°, single and in DT arrangement, the 
following equation is available:
P0r = 0,5 Fr  + 0,46 Fa , kN
For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the 
following equation is available:
P0r = 0,5 Fr  + 0,92 Fa , kN
For single row angular contact ball bearings 
series 70A and 72A with a contact angle α = 
25°, single and in DT arrangement, the following 
equation is available:
P0r = 0,5 Fr  + 0,38 Fa , kN
For bearings in DB and DF arrangement, the 
following equation in available:
P0r = Fr  + 0,76 Fa , kN
Two “V“ scratches are marked on the outside 
surface where the runout is maximum, i.e. where 
the outer ring thickness is maximum, so that 
the bearings of a set can be mounted in the 
manufacturing order. The place of maximum 
runout is marked on the chamfer between the 
inner ring bore and side face. Thus, the possible 
fi t ovalnesses on the shaft can be compensated.
Every set is delivered as an unit, separately 
packed. In each unit, bearings are singly packed.
If distance rings are necessary to be mounted 
between bearings, they have not to be adjusted 
when being mounted. There is only one 
condition to be observed: the inner distance 
ring width should be equal to that of the outer 
ring, the side faces being parallel to each other. 
This can be easily done if both distance rings are 
simultaneously ground on a grinding and lapping 
machine. If bearings are mounted with distance 
rings, the mounting is also done observing the 
“V“ marked as mentioned above. The cone vertex 
should be on the ring side oposite to that one on 
which the load acts (see next fi gure).

Basic dynamic load of paired 
bearings
Basic dynamic load given in bearings tables 
is valid for each single bearing. Basic dynamic 
load of a paired bearings set can be determined 
according to the specifi cations on page 20.
Basic static load of paired bearings
Basic static load of paired bearings can be 
similarly determined, multiplying the values of C0r 
in the tables by 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
Bearing speed limit
Single row angular contact ball bearings are 
used at high speeds.
High precision bearings allow operation at 
higher speeds than those in the catalogue, 
depending on the oil lubrication system (oil bath, 
dropping lubrication, oil spot, with oil cooling).
The values of speeds for bearings series 72B and 
73B, normal tolerance class, without preload are 
given in this catalogue.
In case of preloaded bearings, for single 
mounted bearing and bearings in DB, DF or DT 
arrangements, speed should be multiplied by the 
coeffi  cients in table 7.
For bearings series 70C, 72C, 70A and 72A, 
speeds are given for the tolerance class P4 and 
light preload.
In case of bearings with other values of preloads 
or arrangements of 3 or 4 bearing sets, the 
speeds of the bearing of basic design should be 
multiplied by the values of the coeffi  cients in 
table 7.

Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on the 
shaft and housing shoulder respectively, shaft 
(housing) maximum connection radius ru max 
should be less than bearing minimum mounting 
chamfer r1min., r2min.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized 
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
The values of the connection radii and support 
shoulder height are given in table 8.

Double row angular contact ball bearings are, 
functionally, similar to two single row angular 
contact ball bearings in DB arrangement and they 
have to take axial loads acting in both directions 
and tilting moments.
Double row angular contact ball bearings are 
narrower than a pair of single row angular contact 
ball bearings.
Double row angular contact ball bearings can 
be manufactured in two versions:
- with non-separable inner ring, series 32 and 
33, with a contact angle α= 320;
- with separable inner ring, series 33D, with a 
contact angle α= 450.
Double row angular contact ball bearings, series 
32 and 33 have fi lling slots on one side. If these 
bearings have to take axial loads mainly in one 
direction, they are to be mounted so that axial 
loads acting upon the shaft should be directed to 
the fi lling slots.
Double row angular contact ball bearings series 
33D are suitable to accomodate heavy axial loads 
in both directions.
Dimensions
Main bearing dimensions given in tables are in 
accordance with ISO/R15.
Angular contact ball bearings, 
double row
Misalignment
Angular misalignment of the outer ring, relative 
to the inner ring, is accommodated by force 
between the balls and raceway. This leads to a 
shortening of bearing life.
Tolerances
Double row angular contact ball bearings are 
generally manufactured to the normal tolerance 
class.
Bearing tolerances are given on page 27.
Axial clearance
Double row angular contact ball bearings 
series 32 and 33, with a contact angle α= 320 
are generally manufactured with normal axial 
clearance. They can also be manufactured with 
smaller or larger axial clearances.
Double row angular contact ball bearings series 
33D, with a contact angle α= 450 are generally 
mounted on the shaft with greater tightening 
than those of series 33. For this reason, the axial 
clearance is larger.
The values of axial clearance of the double row 
angular contact ball bearings are given in table 1.
Cages
Double row angular contact ball bearings series 
32, 33 are fi tted with machined brass cages.
Glass fi bre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages are 
also used with good results.
Large-sized bearings are fi tted with pressed 
sheet cages.
Cage design and some technical data are given 
in table 2.

For double row angular contact ball bearings 
series 32 and 33 with a contact angle α= 320:
P0r = Fr + 0,63 Fa, kN
For double row angular contact ball bearings 
series 33D with a contact angle α= 450:
P0r = Fr + 0,46 Fa, kN
For double row angular contact ball bearings 
with a contact angle α= 400:
P0r = Fr + 0,52 Fa, kN
Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on the 
shaft and housing shoulder respectively, shaft 
(housing) maximum radius ru max should be less 
than bearing minimum mounting chamfer rs min.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized 
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
The values of the connexion radii and support 
shoulder height are given in table 3.

Single row angular contact ball bearings
Four point contact ball bearings

DIN 628
General
Four Point Contact Ball Bearings belong to the 
single row angular contact ball bearings family. But, 
unlike bearings of the series 7.., four point contact 
bearings are double - acting. This means they are 
able to support thrust loads in either direction 
including minor radial loads.
URB Four Point Contact Bearings of the QJ 
design have split inner rings to allow the bearing 
to accept the maximum number of large balls. Due 
to the split inner rings these bearings are separable. 
This brings some mounting advantages. Beacause 
the bearing outher ring with cage and ball set, and 
the inner ring halves may be mounted separately.
Design variants
Four Point contact ball bearings are frequently 
used to accomodate trust loads only.
To avoid unforeseen radial loading to the bearing 
they used to be mounted either reduced outside 
bearing ring diameters or to oversized housing seats.
To prevent the outer ring from rotating with the 
shaft, for point contact ball bearing outer rings are 
often produced with locating slots.
Four Point Contact Ball Bearings
For this reason, URB four point contact bearings 
with outer diameters of more then ф160 mm are 
produced with two locating slots in their outer ring 
(suffi  x N2).
Special series of four point contact ball bearings 
are available on request represented by the series 
QJ 10 and four point contact ball bearings with split 
outer ring (Series Q).
Misalignment
Four point contact ball bearings are less suitable to 
operate with misaligments.
When there are used in combination with a radial 
bearing as pure thrust bearings, however, they must 
not be exposed to any misalignment.
Tolerances
URB four point contact ball bearings are produced 
to normal class tolerance (PN) as standard.
Other tolerance classes, such as P6 or P5 are 
available upon request.
Cages
Unless otherwise specifi ed, URB - four point 
contact ball bearings are fi tted with machined solid 
brass cages (suffi  x MPA) as standard.
Also, other cage types and materials are produced 
to order; Machined style solid cage (Suffi  x F) 
machined light metal alloy solid cage (Suffi  x L) 
moulded Polyamide cage (Suffi  x TVP).
Internal clearance
URB four point contact ball bearings are 
produced to axial clearance group CN (Normal) as 
standard.

Special clearance
For applications not covered by the standard 
clearances groups or where bearings with standard 
clearances do not achieve optimum perform, URB 
four point contact ball bearings may also be supplied 
with special internal clearances.
Example:
A80.150 
Special axial internal clearance.

Axial clearance of;

80 to 150 microns (μm)
If required, the range of internal clearance values 
may be grouped to a specifi c part within a clearance 
group.
Example:
C2L 
axial clearance reduced to the

Lower part of the C2 clearance 

group.
Minimum load
Four point contact ball bearings are suitable to 
operate at high speeds. For optimum contacting 
behaviours, however, four point contact ball bearings 
should be mainly exposed to axial acting loads. 
An eff ective function is given, when
Fa ≥ 1,27 * Fr
If this ratio is not attained or achieved high sliding 
friction may occur in the bearing and thus generate high 
noise and excessive wear.
To function eff ectively, four point contact bearings 
should run under minimum bearing load of 
approximately 2 per cent of the dynamic load rating (Cr).
Equivalent dinamic bearing load
In the case of four point contact ball bearings the 
following formula should be used:
when
Fa/Fr ≤ 0,95 then P = Fr + 0,66 * Fa
or, when
Fa/Fr > 0,95 then  P = 0,6 * Fr + 1,07 * Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
P0 = Fr + 0,58 * Fa
Abutment and fi llet dimensions
Four point contact ball bearings are often used 
to accommodate thrust loads, so they do require 
optimum support of the bearings rings by the 
machine components surrounding the bearing.
To gain adequate support the shaft and housing 
shouders required  a certain minimum height.
The bearing rings, however, must only contact 
adjacent parts with there side faces.
URB also produce four point contact ball bearings 
with enlarged (axial clearance groups C3 or C4) and/
or with reduced axial clearance (Clearance group C2) 
on request.
Values for these clearance groups are listed in 
table below.

197
The radii of bearings corners must not touch 
the corner fillet radii of either the shaft or housing 
shoulders. Therefore, the largest fillet radius (rg or 
rg1, respectively) must always be smaller than the

Cylindrical roller bearings are manufactured in 
a various range of constructive types and sizes, 
particularly single row cylindrical roller bearings 
but also two or more row cylindrical roller 
bearings but also two or more row cylindrical 
roller bearings, with cages or roller by roller, as 
shown in the designs below.
In case of cylindrical roller bearings, the rollers 
are laterally guided by the fi xed ribs of one ring.
In case of bearings with cages, the ring with ribs 
and the rollers retained in the cage can be drawn 
out from the other ring, which means that these 
bearings are dismountable.
Cylindrical roller bearings
Therefore, bearings from joints can be much 
easier mounted and dismounted, especially were 
interference fi ts are needed for both rings due to 
the loading conditions.
Bearings are provided with unloaded rollers at 
both generatrix ends. Therefore, the linear contact 
between rollers and rings alters advantageously, 
i.e. peripheral stresses are avoided.

Single or more rows cylindrical 
roller bearings
Single or more rows cylindrical roller bearings 
are manufactured  by URB in various constructive 
versions, depending on the position of the ribs on 
rings. The four basic designs (NU, NJ, N and NUP) 
are given in the bearing tables.
Bearings of NU design have two fi xed ribs on the 
outer ring and one smooth inner ring. Bearings of 
N design have two fi xed ribs on the inner ring and 
one smooth outer ring. These designs allow an 
axial displacement in certain limits, of the shaft 
in relation to the housing. Therefore, these rolling 
bearings are used in non-locating bearing units.
Bearings of NJ design have two fi xed ribs on the 
outer ring and a fi xed rib on the inner ring which 
can guide the shaft in a single direction (axially).
Bearings of NUP design have also two fi xed ribs 
on the outer ring and, on the inner ring, a fi xed rib 
and a support washer. This way they can be used 
as locating bearings, guiding the shaft axially in 
both directions.
For a shaft guiding in a single direction, it 
also can be used a bearing of NU design which 
is combined with a support washer. Thus, the 
constructive version NUJ is obtained.
Support washers on both sides of a bearing of 
NU design are not allowed as they lead to an axial 
blocking of the rollers.
Cylindrical roller bearings can carry heavy radial 
loads and can operate at high speeds.
Double or more rows cylindrical roller bearings 
have small sections, high load carrying capacity 
and stiff ness.
These bearings provide high stiff ness and 
maximum load carrying capacity and are 
particularly used for tool holders of the machine-
tools and rolling mills.
Double row cylindrical roller bearings series 
NNU49 and NN30 are generally manufactured 
to tolerance classes P5 and SP, used for machine 
tools.
Large-sized bearings series NNU49 are also 
manufactured to the normal tolerance class.
Cylindrical roller bearings 
with snap ring groove
Single row cylindrical roller bearings are also 
manufactured with snap ring grooves on the 
outer rings. This design simplifi es the bearing 
joint as the bearings are located into the housing 
by means of the snap rings. The snap ring groove 
and snap rings are in accordance with ISO 464, 
and tables 7 and 8 on page 88 and 90.

clearance C3 for cylindrical bore bearings match Normal radial clearance for tapered bore bearings.
Cylindrical roller bearings 
without cage (full complement)
These bearings incorporate the maximum 
number of rollers and have a small section in 
relation to their width.
This provides a high load carrying capacity and 
allows space-saving designs to be achieved.
Cylindrical roller bearings without cage cannot 
be used at speeds as high as those with cages. 
These bearings are manufactured with single 
or more row rollers and suffi  x V is added to the 
bearing designation. The most utilized bearings 
are those of series NCF29 V, NCF30 V and NJ23VH 
and they are given in this catalogue on page 259.
Dimensions
The main dimensions of standardized bearings 
given in tables are in accordance with ISO 15.
Misalignment
The modfi ed contact between rollers and 
raceway allows not only peripheral stresses to 
be avoided but also, in case of single row roller 
bearings, permits an angular misalignment of 
the outer ring with respect to the inner ring, 
depending on the bearing series and load 
according to the table 1.

Tolerances and radial clearance
Single row cylindrical roller bearings are usually 
manufactured to normal tolerance class with 
normal radial clearance.
They can also be manufactured to more 
accurate tolerance classes and with larger (C3NA 
and C4NA) or smaller (C1NA and C2NA) radial 
clearances.

---

206
Tolerances of cylindrical roller bearings are 
given on pages 27.
Radial clearances according to international 
standard ISO 5753 are given in tales 2 
and 3 for cylindrical bore bearings both 
with 
interchangeable 
rings 
and 
with 
non-interchangeable rings (NA).
Cages
Small and medium-sized single row cylindrical 
roller bearings are generally fi tted with pressed 
sheet cages.
Large-sized bearings are fi tted with machined 
brass cages of normal design, i.e. cages of 
separable design guided on rolling elements M, 
on the outside surface MA or inner surface MB.
In case of heavy loads and high speeds, cages 
are made in one piece.
Glass fi bre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages, are 
succesfully used for small and medium-sized 
bearings, if the operating temperature doesn’t 
exceed + 1200C. These cages have low weight, 
low coeffi  cient of friction and are noiseless while 
running.
Cage design and some technical data are given 
in table 4.

Minimum load
Cylindrical roller bearings must be subjected to 
a given minimum load, so that a proper operation 
of these bearings can be guaranteed.
This is necessary especially as the bearings 
are operated at high speeds and the centrifugal 
forces produce additional friction in bearing due 
to the sliding between rollers and raceway.
The values of the minimum load can be enough 
accurately calculated using the equation:
Frm = 0,02 Cr, kN

Equivalent dynamic radial load
For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially 
loaded 
which 
don’t 
locate 
shafts 
axially, 
equivalent dynamic load is:
Pr = Fr, kN
If cylindrical roller bearings have ribs on the 
outer and inner rings and locate shafts axially in 
one or both directions, equivalent dynamic load 
can be calculated using the equations:
Pr = Fr , kN, 
when Fa/Fr ≤ e
Pr = 0,92 Fr + Y Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr > e
where:
e - calculation factor with values:

- 0,2 for series 10,2,3 and 4

- 0,3 for series 22,23
Y - factor for axial load

- 0,6 for series 10,2,3 and 4

- 0,4 for series 22,23
Cylindrical roller bearings axially loaded run 
satisfactorily only if they are simultaneously 
radially loaded. Ratio Fa/Fr should not exceed 0,5 
for bearings of E design and 0,4 for the other 
bearings.
Equivalent static radial load
For cylindrical roller bearings purely radially 
loaded, equivalent static load is:
P0r = Fr, kN
Dynamic axial load
Bearings with ribs on the outer ring can 
accommodate axial loads in addition to radial 
loads. The axial load carryng capacity of cylindrical 
roller bearings do not depend essentially on 
the steel fatigue strength, but on the resistance 
of the sliding surfaces at the roller end and rib 
contact and therefore on lubrication, operating 
temperature and bearing thermal conductivity.
Considering the above mentioned, axial load 
carrying capacity of a cylindrical roller bearing 
can be enough accurately calculated usign the 
following equation:
F
n(d
D)
k
k F ,
C 10

r

where:
Fa max  
- maximum permissible axial load, kN
C0r  
- radial static load, kN
Fr  
- radial load component, kN
n  
- operating speed, r/min
d  
- bearing bore diameter, mm
D  
- bearing outside diameter, mm
k1  
- auxiliary factor, see table 5
k2  
- auxiliary factor, see table 5
The above equation is based on conditions 
which are considered typical for normal bearing 
operation:
-  a diff erence of 600C between the bearing 
operating temperature and the ambient 
temperature
-  a specifi c heat loss from the bearing of 
0,5 mW/mm2 0C
- a viscozity ratio k=2.
The viscosity ratio k is the ratio of the actual 
viscosity at the operating temperature to the 
requisite viscosity for a proper lubrication at that 
temperature. Further details can be found in 
subchapter “Adjusted rating life”, life adjustment 
factor a23 - on page 21.
In case of grease lubrication, the base oil 
viscosity of the grease should be used. These 
eff ects can be reduced at low speeds by using oils 
with EP additives.

The values of permissible axial load Fa max 
obtained from the equation above mentioned are 
valid for a continuously acting constant axial load. 
If axial loads act only for short periods, the values 
may be multiplied by 2 or for shock loads by 3.
The constantly acting axial load Fa max (N) should 
never exceed the numerical value of 1,2 D2 
(D = bearing outside diameter, mm) and 
occasional shock loads should never be greater 
than the numerical value of 3D2.
In case of heavy axial loads (Fa > D2), the ribs 
of the outer and inner ring respectively are

recommended to be supported by the bearing 
adjoint parts. Bearings of NUP and NJ+HJ designs 
which take axial loads in both directions are to be 
placed so that main axial loads should be taken 
by fi xed ribs, if bearing design allows.
Heat treatment
Cylindrical roller bearings with outside diameter 
D > 240 mm of all series given in the catalogue are 
to be subject to a heat treatment of sress relieving 
which allows bearings to be operated up to a 
temperature of +1500C.
The hardness of rigs should not be less 59 HRC.
Small-sized bearings operate normally up to 
+1200C.
Abutment dimensions
For a proper location of bearing rings on the 
shaft and housing shoulder respectively, shaft 
(housing) maximum radius ru max should be less 
than bearing minimum mounting chamfer rs min.
Shoulder height should also be properly sized 
in case of bearing maximum mounting chamfer.
The values of the connection radius and support 
shoulder height are given in table 6.
Abutment dimensions for single row cylindrical 
roller bearings are given in table 7. The values for 
double row cylindrical roller bearings are given in 
table 8.

Double row cylindrical roller bearings,

DIN 5412 / part 4
General
Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of series 
NN30.. and NNU 49 are separable radial bearings.
They are frequently used as non - locating 
bearings arrangements of working spindles for 
machine tools. Therefore, these bearings are 
often used in high precision telerance class, 
frequently in combination with reduced internal 
clearance. These bearings also feature high radial 
load capacity and are satisfactory for high speed 
applications, providing a very stiff  and rigid 
bearing arrangement. They are also commonly 
used with tapered bores, namely suffi  x K, (i.e. 
taper 1:12).
Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Design variants of Double Row 
Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of series 
NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are produced and available 
either with or without tapered bores, as standard 
(see also Abb, 1).
Bearings of series NN 30.. comprise of a plain 
outer ring and an inner ring with three integral 
shoulders to guide the two separate rows of 
rollers around the raceway. These bearings series 
are produced with lubrication facilities in their 
outer ring, such as a circumferential lubrication 
groove and holes as standard, namelu suffi  x W33.
Unlike the NN30.. series the double row 
cylindrical roller bearings of the NNU 49.. series 
feature opposite internal design characteristics, 
(i.e. outer ring with 3 integral shoulders around 
the raceway and a plain inner ring). These bearing 
series also feature lubrication facilities in their 
outer ring as standard, also namely, suffi  x W33.

---

318
Cylindrical roller bearings of series BB30.. 
and NNU49.. allow for compensation of length 
changes within the bearings itself. In this way 
they are ideal non-locating bearings.
Both bearing rings may be mounted with 
heavy interference fi t to shaft and housing.
Misalignment
Double Row Cylindrical Roller bearings are not 
able to accomodate misalignments.
Tolerances
Double Row Cilindrical Roller Bearings of 
series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are frequently used 
as spindle bearings.
Consequently, they are also available with 
closer tolerance classes, such as P4 or SP, as 
standard.
On request these bearings are also be produced 
to other tolerance classes.
Detailed tolerance values, for URB double 
row cylindrical roller bearings and URB double 
row cylindrical roller bearings in spindle 
bearing design, tolerance class SP, are listed 
in the table shown in the chapter “Bearing 
tolerances” page 32.
Cages
URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings of 
the series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are produced with 
roller riding solid brass cages as standard.
Internal clearance
URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
are produced with normal internal clearance 
(clearance group CN, historically designated C0) 
as standard. Other internal radial clearances are 
produced upon order request.
NOTE:
URB Double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
of series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. produced to high 
precision design are frequently used with reduced 
internal radial clearance (clearance group C1).
As these bearings are produced to very closed 
tolerances, under no circumstances should 
components be mixed or exchanged with other 
bearing parts.
The value of internal clearance groups of URB 
Cylindrical Roller Bearings are listed in the tables 
on page 205.
These Values conform, as far as they are 
standardised, and conform to DIN 620/part 4 and 
ISO 5753-1991, respectively.
Minimum load
The minimum load applied to fast rotating 
double row cylindrical roller bearings should be 
higher than 4 % of its dynamic load rating Cr.
Equivalent Dynamic bearing load
Since double Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings 
of series NN 30.. and NNU 49.. are non - locating 
bearings, they are not able to accomodate any 
thrust loads.
P = Fr
Equivalent static bearing load
For Single and Double row cylindrical roller 
bearings:
P0 = Fr
Mounting
When handling High Precision double row 
cylindrical roller bearings particular attention 
must be paid to the relevant instructions of fi tting 
and mounting of these bearings.
When double row cylindrical roller bearings, 
with tapered inner bores, are mounted the eff ect 
on the running clearance can be adjusted to 
obtain a specifi c clearance or preload.
As these bearing types are separable under 
no circumstances should either components or 
assembled bearings be mixed or exchanged with 
other bearing parts.

Abutment and fi llet dimensions for Double 
row cylindrical roller bearings
The bearing rings must only contact adjacent 
parts with their side faces. The bearing corners 
must not touch the corner fi llet radii or either the 
shaft or housing corners.
Therefore, the largest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of the 
bearings rings (rs) as listed in the bearing tables, 
also see next page.
Recommendations for the dimensions of 
adjacent parts are listed in DIN 5418.

Needle roller bearings

Tapered roller bearings have the rolling 
elements under the form of frustra of cones. 
They roll on tapered surfaces which, if extended, 
converge towards a single point on the bearing 
axis.
The rollers are guided tangentially by the cage 
and axially by the big rib of the outer ring, on 
which they have point contact. As between roller 
Tapered roller bearings
and raceways there is linear contact, tapered 
roller bearings can take heavy radial loads. They 
can also take heavy axial or combined loads, 
depending on the contact angle caused by the 
tapered rolling elements. The contact angle is the 
angle of the outer raceway generatrix.
Tapered roller bearings can be manufactured in 
the versions: single, double and four row rollers.

Single row tapered roller bearings
Single row tapered roller bearings are of 
separable design, i.e. the outer ring and the inner 
ring with rollers and cage assembly can be be 
separately mounted. These  two assemblies are 
interchangeable.
Tapered roller bearings can be manufactured 
both in standardized constructive versions with 
dimensions series 320, 302, 322, 303, 323, 313 and 
with non-standardized dimensions, mm or inch.
Tapered roller bearings can carry only single 
direction axial loads. Under pure radial loads, an 
axial force occurs which is supossed to distance 
the bearing ring in axial direction. Therefore, 
tapered roller bearings are generally pair 
mounted on both ends of the shaft, in "X" or "O" 
arrangements, so that the shaft will be axially 
located in both directions (table 4). Thus, the 
optimum clearance in these two bearings can be 
adjusted.
Single row tapered roller bearings can also be 
manufactured with rib on the outer ring. This 
design is to be used when the housing cannot 
be manufactured with shoulder, but only with a 
passed through bore. In this case, axial location 
can be provided by the bearing ring.
Paired single row tapered roller 
bearing
If tapered roller bearings are pair mounted in "X" 
or "O" arrangements, the load carryng capacity 
inreases and loads can be taken in both directions 
in the same bearing.
These bearing sets have guaranteed clearance 
after mounting since the distance rings are 
mounted between the bearing rings.
For certain application, paired bearings can 
be delivered with small clearance or lightly 
preloaded.
Double row tapered roller bearings
Double row tapered roller bearings are used 
where load carrying capacity should be greater, 
loads should be taken in both directions and axial 
space is smaller than in case of a set of two single 
row tapered roller bearings.
Double row tapered roller bearings can have the 
rollers in face-to-face arrangement, i.e. double 
outer ring and two inner rings.
The fi rst design provides greater stiff ness, can 
take tilting moments and shaft expansions can 
be compensated.
The bearings of the second design can be 
manufactured with tapered bore so that they can 
be frequently mounted / dismounted.
Double row tapered roller bearings can have 
or not distance rings with lubrication holes, 
mounted between the simple rings.
In case of bearings with distance rings, the 
bearing clearance or preload are pre-adjusted; 
in case of those without distance rings, bearing 
clearance and preload can and should be 
adjusted while mounting.
Double row tapered roller bearings with 
rollers in back-to-back arrangement can also be 
manufactured in the following two versions:
- with rib on the outer ring; the housing has no 
shoulder and the bearing is axially located by the 
rib;
with two seals; this design is used in motor 
vehicles construction. The bearings are delivered 
fi lled with grease and relubrication is not needed.
Dimensions
Tapered roller bearings are manufactured with 
the following dimension:
- metric dimension (mm), according to ISO 355;
- inch dimensions
Misalignment
As between rollers and raceway there is a linear 
contact, tapeed roller bearings have low capacity 
to compensate for errors, of alignment between 
shaft and housing.
Permissible values of misalignment between 
shaft and housing are given in table 1, depending 
on bearing size and load magnitude.

bearings 
are 
generally 
manufactured to the normal tolerance class ISO 
and AFBMA, respectively (for bearings with inch 
dimensions).
For certain applications (e.g. bearings for 
machine-tools), they can be also manufactured to 
tolerance classes P5 and P6X or 3 AFBMA.

At request, they can be manufactured to 
tolerance class P4.
Single row tapered roller bearings have thr outer 
rings interchangeable with the inner ring - rollers 
- cage assembly (if they have the same mark) and 
also with bearings produced by other companies, 
according to ISO and AFBMA respectively.
The parts of the two and four row tapered roller 
bearings are non-interchangeable.
The tolerances for bearings overall dimensions 
are given in tables on the page 34 for tapered 
roller bearings, both with metric and inch 
dimensions. Tolerances for mounting chamfer are 
given in tables on page 43.
Radial and axial clearance
In case of tapered roller bearings, clearance 
should be in radial direction, but it is measured 
and adjusted in axial direction. As tapered roller 
bearings are dismountable, their clearance is not 
guaranteed by design and it is adjusted while 
mounting. Thus, optimum clearance can be 
obtained for that application.
In case of double and four row tapered roller 
bearings with distance rings between bearing 
rings, the clearance is guaranteed and its values 
are given in table 2. The bearing parts are 
numbered for each bearing so that the prescribed 
clearance on each row should be observed while 
mounting.
In case of bearings without distance rings, 
clearance is adjusted as for single row tapered roller 
bearings: for DB design - by the inner rings and for DF 
design by the outer rings. The above specifi cations 
are also available for bearings matched in sets.
The values of the axial clearance can be 
calculated using the equation:
axial clearan ce
2 tg
rad ial clearan ce
=
a
where α is the contact angle.
In case of certain applications where clearance 
between shaft and housing should be avoided, 
tapered roller bearings can also be pre-tightened. 
This can be adjusted while mounting or is pre-
adjusted by distance rings, in case of two or four 
row tapered roller bearings.
Contact angle of tapered roller beaings is the 
angle of the outer ring raceway generatrix. In 
case of standardized single row tapered roller 
bearings, this angle can be found in the standard 
of dimension ISO 355.
Bearing series 329, 302, 322, 303 and 323 have a 
contact angle 10° and 17° and those of series 313 
have a contact angle of 28° 48' 39'', so that they 
can take heavier axial loads.
Non-standardized single row tapered roller 
bearings and also all double and four-row tapered 
roller bearings have the contact angle between 
90° and 30°.

Cages
Small and medium-sized tapered roller bearings 
are generally fi tted with pressed sheet cages. 
Large sized bearings are generally fi tted with 
machined steel or brass caces, with welded pins. 
In some cases, median or large sized bearings can 
also be fi tted with machined steel or brass cages. 
In all cases, the cage is guided on rollers.
For small and medium sized bearings, glass 
fi bre reinforced polyamide 6.6 cages can be 
successfully used if the operating temperature 
doesn't exceed +120°C. They have low weight, 
are noiseless in operation an have low coeffi  cient 
of friction.
Design and some technical data are given in 
table 3.
Equivalent dynamic radial load
Equivalent dynamic radial load can be calculated 
using the following equations:
- for single row tapered roller bearings:
Pr=Fr, kN, 
when Fa/Fr ≤ e
Pr= 0,4 Fr + YFa, kN, when Fa/Fr > e
For single row tapered roller bearings, the Fa 
values can be calculated using the equations 
in table 4. These equations are available when 
bearings are mounted so that axial clearance is 
in fact zero without preloading. FrA and FrB should 
always be considered as being positive, even if 
they act in the opposite direction to that in the 
fi gure.
In case of paired bearings and of double or 
four row tapered roller bearings, Fa and Fr are the 
loads acting upon the paired bearings or single 
bearings.
The values of e, Y, Y1 and Y2  are given in bearing 
tables.
Equivalent static radial load
Equivalent static radial load can be calculated 
using the equations:
- for single row tapered roller bearings:
P0r=Fr, kN, 
when Fa/Fr ≤ 1/2 Y0
P0r= 0,5 Fr + Y0 Fa, kN, when Fa/Fr > 1/2 Y0
-  for paired double or four row tapered roller 
bearings:
P0r= Fr + Y0 Fa, kN
Fa is calculated as in case of equivalent dynamic 
radial load. The values of Y0 are given in bearing 
tables.
Abutment dimensions
The mounting dimensions of tapered roller 
bearings are given in the bearings tables, for single 
row tapered roller bearings. These dimensions 
are also available for bearings with ribs and for 
standardized paired bearings. These dimensions 
are also available for bearings with ribs and for 
standardized paired bearings. For the other 
types of tapered roller bearings, the mounting 
dimensions should be adapted depending on the 
cross section size and mounting chamfer.

Spherical roller bearings
Spherical roller bearings operate in arduous 
conditions. The spherical rollers can be symmetrical 
or unsymmetrical and are self-aligning in the outer 
ring sphered raceway. Thus, the possible coaxiality 
deviations of the supporting bearings as well as shaft 
bending can be compensated.
Spherical roller bearings are manufactured in the 
following constructive versions, depending on the 
bearing size and series.
MB design
These bearings have a central fi xed rib and 
machined cages guided on the inner ring rib.
MA design
These bearings have a central fi xed rib and 
machined cages guided on the outer ring rib.
C design
These bearings have a central guide rib fl oating 
on the inner ring, symmetrical rollers with larger 
dimensions so that the load carrying capacity 
increases. Special pressed sheet cage. Bearings of 
this design are of small and medium sizes.
CA design
These bearings have side shoulders and an 
one-piece machined brass cage. They also have 
symmetrical rollers with larger dimensions so that 
the load carrying capacity increases. This design 
is available for medium and large-sized bearings
Other constructive versions are shown below:
Cylindrical bore, lubrication groove and holes in 
the outer ring
Tapered bore, lubrication groove and holes in 
the outer ring

Tolerances
Spherical roller bearings with both cylindrical and 
tapered bore, are manufactured in normal tolerance 
class (see chapter Bearing tolerance, page 27).
Radial Clearance
Spherical 
roller 
bearings 
are 
generally 
manufactured with normal radial clearance. 
At request, they can be manufactured with 
clearances larger than normal (C3, C4 etc.) or 
smaller than normal (C2).
The limit values of the radial clearance measured 
on unloaded bearings are in accordance with SR 
ISO 5753 and are given in tables 1 and 2.
Dimensions
The main dimensions of spherical roller bearings 
are in accordance with ISO 15 and national 
standard SR 3918 respectively.
The dimensions of the adapter sleeves are in 
accordance with national standard SR ISO 2982-1.

Misalignment
Spherical 
roller 
bearings 
allow 
angular 
misalignment between the outer ring and inner 
ring without any infl uence on the bearing rating 
life. Under normal loads and operating conditions 
and when the inner ring rotates, the values of 
the permissible misalignment depending on the 
bearing series are given in table 3.
Cages
Small and medium size spherical roller bearing 
are fi tted with pressed sheet or machined brass 
cages (Y). Bearings of normal design are fi tted 
with machined brass or steel cages guided on the 
rollers (M), inner ring (MB) or outer ring raceway 
(MA).

Lubrication grooves and holes
Spherical roller bearings are provided with a 
lubrication groove and holes in the outer ring, 
excepting those of series 213. Designation suffi  x 
W33 is used to identify this feature on bearings. 
The dimensions of the groove, bore diameter and 
their number depending on the dimension series 
are given in table 5.
Axial load for bearings mounted on adapter 
sleeves
If the spherical roller bearings are mounted on 
a smooth shaft using an adapter sleeve, without 
side support, the axial load carrying capacity 
depends on the friction between shaft and sleeve.
Considering that the mounting is correctly 
done, the permissible axial load can be accurately 
enough determined using the following equation
Fa max = 3 B d, kn
where:
Fa max - maximum permissible axial load, kN;
B - bearing width, mm;
d - bearing bore diameter, mm.
Equivalent dynamic radial load
Pr=Fr+Y1Fa, kN, for Fa/Fr≤e
Pr=67 Fr+Y2Fa, kN, for Fa/Fr>e 
The values of the factors depending on the 
bearing type can be found in bearing tables.

DIN 711
General
Thrust Ball Bearings are separable axial 
bearings that are produced in both single and 
double direction acting design.
To assist in simple eff ective mounting or 
dismounting the bearing washers, seatings, and 
cage and ball assemblies, may be individually 
mounted in their arrangement location.
Thrust ball bearings may accomodate compa-
ratively high axial loads but they must not be 
exposed to any radial forces.
Due to their specifi c kinematic behavior, thrust 
ball bearings are only suitable for low to medium 
operating speeds.
Futhermore, they require minimum axial loads 
for their optimum function.
Since thrust ball bearings do not compensate 
any misalignment, they are also frequently used 
in conjunction with sphered housing washers 
and seating washers.
Design variants (see drawing on right page)
Thrust ball bearings are produced in both, 
single direction and double direction design. The 
most important design variants are shown on the 
opposite page.
Single direction thrust ball bearings consist 
of a shaft washer, a housing washer and a ball 
and cage thrust assembly, (see fi gure a, b and c).
These bearings are able to accomodate axial 
loads in one direction only.
Single direction thrust ball bearings of series 
511, 512, 513 and 514 have plain housing 
washers, (see fi gure a).
For applications where some misalignment may 
occur, single direction thrust ball bearings of the 
series 532, 533 and 534 are also available with 
sphered housing washers, fi gure b.
These bearings may be applied either direct to 
sphered shaped bearings seats or, they may be 
used together with seating washers of series U2, 
U3 or U4 (see fi gure c).
Unlike single direction thrust ball bearing 
types, double direction thrust ball bearings are 
suitable to guide the shaft in both directions (see 
fi gure d, e and f).
These bearings consist of two washers, two ball 
and cage thrust assemblies with one common 
shaft washer located centrally in between.
Double direction thrust ball bearings are also 
available in both designs, with fl at housing 
washers (series 522, 523 and 524, see fi gure d) 
and with sphered housing washers (series 542, 
543 and 544, see fi gure e).
For compensation of possible aligning errors 
the double direction thrust ball bearings may be 
used in conjunction with Seating Washers (series 
U2, U3 and U4, see fi gure f).

Misalignment
All thrust ball bearing types with fl at housing 
washers do not allow any misalignment.
The contacting surfaces of both shaft and 
housing seats must be parallel. Misalignments 
can only be accomodated by using Thrust Ball 
bearings with sphered housing washers.
Cages
URB thrust ball bearings are normally fi tted 
with pressed steel cages as standard.
For larger thrust ball bearings solid brass cages, 
(suffi  x M), or solid steel cages, sufi x F), are fi tted 
as standard.
Tolerances
URB thrust ball bearings are produced to 
normal class tolerance class (PN) as standard.
For applications of higher dimensional and 
geometrical 
accuracy 
these 
bearings 
are 
produced to precision tolerance class (e.g. P6) on 
order request.
For detailed values of the tolerance classes see 
chapter Bearing tolerances (see page 40).
Minimum load:
Thrust ball bearings require a certain minimum 
axial load to esnsure a satisfactory operating 
function.
To prevent excessive sliding friction, the 
minimum axial load applied should be greater 
than 4% of the axial bearing dynamic load rating 
Ca.
Where such a minimum axial load is not 
possible, the load must be increased by eff ective 
measures, (i.e. preloading the bearing) using 
pressure washers or springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Thrust ball bearings are pure axial bearings, 
their are not able to accomodate any radial loads, 
therefore:
P=Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
For thrust ball bearings:
P0=Fa 
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for thrust ball 
bearings
The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts 
with their face sides only. The radii of bearing 
corners must not touch the shoulder fi llet radii of 
the shaft or housing shoulders.
Therefore, the larest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of the 
bearing rings (rs) as listed in the bearing tables.

DIN 616
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings 
DIN 722
General
Cylindrical Roller Thrust Bearings series 811 
and 812 are single direction acting separable 
axial bearings.
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are insensitive 
to shock loading and feature much higher 
load carrying capacity compared to thrust ball 
bearings. They accomodate very heigh axial loads 
but no radial forces. They provide a very rigid 
bearing assembly for high thrust loading with less 
space requirement.
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are of simple 
design, they consist of a shaft washer (WS), a 
housing washer (GS), and a cylindrical roller 
and cage thrust assembly (K), see Abb. 1.
With all cylindrical roller thrust bearings, 
increased sliding friction can occur at the end of 
the cylindrical rollers.
In order to minimise this negative eff ect, URB 
cylindricall roler thrust bearings with wider 
sectional widths are produced using several 
short rollers in each cage pockets instead of using 
individual longer rollers.
Due to their specifi c kinematic behaviour, 
cylindrical roller thrust bearings are only suitable 
for low speed applications only. Furthermore, 
they require minimal axial loads for their optimum 
function.
Design variants
URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings are 
produced in single direction design only as 
standard (see Abb. 1a)

---

552
Double direction acting cylindrical roller 
thrust bearings are built using a combination 
of the components from single direction acting 
cylindrical roller thrust bearings together with 
intermediate washers ZS, (see Abb. 1 b).
Such intermediate washers are part of URB 
supplementary product range and are available 
on request. 
For application designs with space restrictions 
the cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
may be used without washers providing the 
contact faces of adjacent machine parts are 
machined as bearing raceways, (e.g. hardened 
and ground, etc).
The components of cylindrical roller thrust 
bearing are frequently used either separately or 
in conjunction with othercomponents in several 
applications (e.g. to build needle roller thrust 
assemblies) therefore, they are available as loose 
parts.
Misalignment
All cylindrical roller thrust bearing type do 
not allow any misalignment.
The contacting surfaces of both shaft and 
housing seats must be parallel.
Cages
Small URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings 
are fi tted with shaft - centred polyamide cages 
as standard. Polyamide cages are suitable for 
operating temperatures up to +120ºC.
Large cylindrical roller thrust bearings are 
produced with either solid brass cages (suffi  x 
MP), or with solid steel cages, (suffi  x FP).
Tolerances
URB cylindrical roller thrust bearings are 
produced to normal class tolerance (PN) as 
standard. 
For applications of higher accuracy these 
bearings are produced to precision tolerance 
class (e.g. P6) on order request.
For detailed values of the tolerance classes see 
chapter "Bearing tolerances" (see page 40).
Minimum load:
All cylindrical roller thrust bearing require 
a certain minimum axial load to ensure a 
satisfactory operating function.
To prevent excessive sliding friction, the 
minimum axial load applied should be greater 
than 5% of the axial bearing dynamic load rating 
Ca.
Where such a minmum axial load is not possible 
the load must be increased by eff ective measures, 
(i.e. preloading the bearing) using pressure 
washers or springs.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Cylindrical roller thrust bearings are pure axial 
bearings, they are not able to accomodate any 
radial loads, therefore:
P = Fa
Equivalent static bearing load
For cylindrical roller thrust bearings:
P0 = Fa
Design of adjacent machine parts
When cylindrical roller and cage thrust 
assemblies are used without washers adjacent 
machines parts must be designed and machined 
as bearing raceways (e.g. hardened and ground 
etc).
The maximum permissible axial runout of the 
adjacent surfaces acting as raceway must also 
meet the requirements of the respective washers.
For detailed information see chapter "Design of 
bearing location", on page 45.
The bore diameters of URB cylindrical roller 
and cage thrust assemblies have tolerances 
according to ISO Tolerance fi eld (E11), whilst 
the tolerance of their outer diameters lies in the 
tolerance fi eld (a13).
Cylindrical roller and cage thrust assemblies 
require an eff ective guidance when operating at 
higher speeds.

---

553
To avoid excessive wear, at higher speeds, the 
guiding surface must be ground.
Bearing seats for cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings
For the design of cylindrical roller thrust bearing 
seats the following of tolerance fi elds have proven 
to be satisfactory in practice:

Abutment and Fillet dimensions for cylindrical 
roller thrust bearings
In case of cylindrical roller thrust bearings, an 
eff ective support of the bearing washers over the 
total width of their raceways by adjacent machine 
parts is necessary.
The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts 
with their side face only. The fi llet radii of bearing 
corners must not touch the shoulder fi llet radii of 
the shaft or housing shoulders.
Therefore, the largest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of the 
bearing rings (rs) as listed in the following tables.

Needle roller thrust bearings  

DIN 5405
General
Needle roller thrust bearings are single 
direction acting separable axial bearings that 
require less overall height.
Needle roller thrust bearings accept axial 
loads only and are insensitive to shock loading.
Thus, needle roller thrust bearings provide 
a very rigid thrust bearing arrangement with 
minimal axial space requirement.
Several variations of thrust bearings are 
available for consideration depandant upon the 
space availability, running accuracy precision, or 
guidance requirements.
As for cylindrical roller thrust bearings, the 
needle roller thrust bearings are also subject to 
increased sliding friction.
In order to avoid the negative eff ects of excessive 
sliding friction, needle roller thrust bearings are 
only suitable for low speed applications.
Needle roller thrust bearings require minimum 
axial loads for there optimum function.
Design variants 
(see sketches below)
URB needle roller thrust bearings provide 
and enable several diff erent solutions for thrust 
bearing assemblies.
Due to the possible variations of assemblies, 
single or loose components may be ordered 
separately.
The simplest form of needle roller thrust 
bearings consists of a needle roller set and cage 
assembly (i.e. the cage retains and guides the 
rollers), namely AXK.

---

568
Double 
direction 
acting 
needle 
roller 
thrust bearings can be achieved by using two 
needle roller and cages assemblies with a ZS - 
intermediate washer.
Such intermediate washers are part of the 
URB special products range and are produced 
according to customers order requirements.
Misalignment
All needle roller thrust bearing types do not 
allow any misalignment.
The contacting surfaces of both shaft and 
housing seats must be parallel.
Cages
Small URB needle roller and cage thrust 
assemblies are fi tted with shaft - centered solid 
polyamide cages as standard.
These cages are suitable for permanent 
operating temperatures up on +120 0C.
Larger needle roller and cage thrust assemblies 
feature pressed steel cages as standard.
Tolerances
URB needle roller and cage thrust assemblies 
(AXK . . . ) including the thrust washers are 
produced, as standard, to the tolerances as listed 
in the following tables.

assembleis, type AXK ...

Needle roller and cage thrust assemblies run 
directly on the counter surfaces of their adjacent 
machine parts.
These bearing types require a minimum axial 
space.
All contacting surfaces therefore must be 
designed and produced as bearing raceways (i.e. 
hardened and ground etc).
For detailed information see chapter "Bearing 
aplication" page 45.
Where it is not feasible to machine the adjacent 
mating surfaces for either technnical, quality 
or economical reasons, these needle roller and 
cage assemblies may be combined using various 
combination of washers.
The simplest design is provided by using 
needle roller and cage thrust assemblies with 
AS - thrust washers, AS - thrust washers are 
thin washers made from hardened spring steel.
They are approximately 1 mm thick and feature 
polished surfaces.
The use of such thrust bearing arrangements 
provide economic and space - saving bearing 
arrangements for cases where the adjacent parts 
have suffi  cient strenght but no possibility to act 
as raceways, (e.g. housings made from cast iron).
The expected running accuracy, however, will 
be low.
Where a more precise running accuracy of 
the bearing arrangement is required, raceways 
washers (LS) must be used.
Raceways washers are made from hardened 
bearing chromium steel and have ground 
raceways but only turned surfaces on both outer 
and bore diameters.
The raceway washers should be used in 
applications where low speeds occur and a 
precise positioning of the raceway washers is 
unnecessary.
Raceway washers may be used as either shaft 
or housing washers.
For application that require precise shaft 
guidance, AXK - needle roller and cage thrust 
assemblies may also be combined with shaft and 
housing washers of the cylindrical roller thrust 
bearings of series 811.

Minimum load
Needle roller thrust bearings require certain 
minimum axial load to perform eff ectively.
To prevent excessive sliding friction, the 
minimum axial load applied should be over 0,5% 
of the axial bearing static load rating C0a.
Where such a minimum load is not achieved the 
load must be increased by eff ective measures, (i.e. 
preloading the bearing), using spring washers or 
springs etc.
Equivalent dynamic bearing load
Needle roller thrust bearings are pure axially 
loaded bearings.
They are not able to accomodate any radial 
loads, therefore:
P = Fa

---

570
Equivalent static bearing load
For needle roller thrust bearings:
P0 = Fa
Design of adjacent machine parts
Where AXK needle roller and cage thrust 
assemblies are used without any additional 
washers, the adjacent machine parts must 
be designed and produced as raceways (e.g. 
hardened and ground etc.).
The maximum permissible axial runout  of the 
adjacent surfaces acting as a raceway must also 
equal the requirements of the respective washer 
raceways.
For detailed information see chapter "Bearing 
aplication", page 45.
Needle roller and cage thrust assemblies 
require an eff ective shaft quidance when 
operating at high speeds.
To avoid excessive wear at high speeds, the 
guiding surfaces must be ground.

Abutment and Fillet dimensions for needle 
roller thrust bearings
In the case of needle roller thrust bearings, an 
adequate support of bearing washers over the 
total width of their raceways by adjacent machine 
parts is necessary.
The bearing washer must contact adjacent parts 
with their face sides only.
The fi llet radii of bearing corners must not touch 
the shoulder fi llet radii of neither the shaft or 
housing shoulders.
Therefore, the largest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of the 
bearing rings (rs) as listed in the bearing tables 
(see the sketch on page 571).

Load Rating
Basic dynamic load rating
This term is arrived at based on an evaluation of 
a number of identical linear systems individually 
run in the same conditions, if 90% of them can run 
with the load with a constant value in a constant 
direction) for a distance of 50 km without damage 
caused by rolling fatigue. This is the basis of the 
rating.
Allowable static moment
This term defi nes the allowable limit value of 
static moment load with reference to the amount 
of permanent deformation similar to that used for 
evaluation of basic rated load (Co).
Static safety factor
This factor is used based on the application 
condition as swown in Table 1.
Basic static load rating
This term defi nes a static load such that, at the 
contacting position where the maximum stress is 
exercised, the sum of the permanent deformation 
of the rolling elements and that of the rolling 
plane is 0,0001 time of the diameter of the rolling 
elements.
Static safety factors
Table 1
Condition of use
Low limit of fs
When the shaft has less 
defl ection and shock
1 to 2
When elastic deformation 
should be considered with 
respect to pinch load
2 to 4
When the equipment is subject 
to vibration and impacts
3 to 5

Rating life
Rating life of the linear system
As long as linear system reciprocates while 
being loaded, continous stress acts on the linear 
system to couse fl aking on the rolling bodies 
and planes because of material fatigue. The 
travelling distance of linear system until the fi rst 
fl aking occurs is called the life of the system. The 
life of the dimensions, structure, material, heat 
treatment and processing method, when used 
in the same conditions. This variation is brought 
about from the essential variations in the material 
fatigue itself. The rating life defi ned below is used 
as an index for the life expectancy of the linear 
system.
Rating life
Rating life is the total travelling distance that 
90% of a group of systems of the same size can 
reach without causing any fl aking when they 
operate under the same conditions.
The rating life can be obtained from the 
following equation with the basic dynamic load 
rating and the load on the linear system:
For ball type:
L
P
C
50,
3
= `
j
where:
L  
- rating life, km,
C  
- basic dynamic load rating, N,
P  
- load, N.
Consideration and infl uence of vibration impact 
loads and distribution of load should be taken 
into account when designing a linear motion 
system. It is diffi  cult to calculate the actual load.

The rating life is also aff ected by the operating 
temperature. In these conditions, the expression 
(1) is arranged as follows:

The rating life in hours can be calculated by 
obtaining the travelling distance per unit time.

Hardness factor
The shaft be suffi  ciently hardened when a 
linear bushing is used. If not properly hardened, 
permissible load is lowered and the life of the 
bushing will be shortened
Temperature coeffi  cient
If the temperature of the linear system exceeds 
100oC, Hardness of the linear system and the 
shaft lowers to decresure the permissible load 
compared to that of the linear system used at 
room temperature rise shortens the rating life.
Contact coeffi  cient
Generally two or more linear bushing are used 
on one shaft. Thus, the load on each linear system 
diff ers depending on each precessing accuracy. 
Because the linear bushing are not loaded 
equally, the number of linear bushing per shaft 
changes the permissible load of system.

Load coeffi  cient
When calculating the load on the linear system, 
it is necessary to accurately obtain object weight, 
inertial force based on motion speed, moment 
load, and each transition as time passes. However, 
it is diffi  cult to calculate those values accurately 
because reciprocating motion involves the 
repetition of start and stop as well as vibration 
and impact. A more practical approach is to 
obtain the load coeffi  cient by taking the actual 
oprating conditions into account.

Frictional resistance
The static frictional resitance of the URB linear 
system is so low as to be only slightly diff erent 
from the kinetic frictional resitance, enabling 
smooth linear movement from low to high 
speeds. In general, the friction resitance is 
expressed by the following equation.
F = μ W+f,
where:
F  
- frictional resitance,
μ  
- coeffi  cient of friction,
W  
- load weight,
f  
- sealing resistance.
The frictional resistance of each URB linear 
system depends on the model, load weight, speed, 
and lubricant. The sealing resistance depends on 
lip interference and lubricant, regardless of the 
load weigh. The sealing resistance of one linear 
system is about 200 to 500 gf. The coeffi  cient of 
friction depends on the load weight, moment 
load, and preload. Table 6 shows the coeffi  cient 
of kinetic friction of each type of linear system 
which has been instaled and lucricated properly 
and applied with normal load (P/C=0,2)

Lubrication and dust prevention
Using URB linear systems without lubrication 
increases the abrasion of the rolling elements, 
shortening the life span. The URB linear systems, 
therefore 
require 
appropriate 
lubrication. 
For lubrication URB recommends turbine oil 
conforming to ISO Standards G32 to G68 or 
lithium base soap grease no. 2. Some URB 
linear systems are sealed to block dust out and 
seal lubricant in. If used in a harsh or corrosive 
environment, however, apply a protective cover 
to the part involving linear motion.
Structure and features
The URB linear bushing consists of an outer 
cylinder, ball retainer, balls and two end rings. 
The ball retainer which holds the balls, in the 
recirculating trucks inheld inside the outer 
cylinder by end rings.
Those parts are assembled to optimize their 
required functions.
The outer cylinder is maintained suffi  cient 
hardness by heat treatment, therefore if ensures 
the bushings projected travel life and satisfactory 
durability.
The ball retainer is made from synthetics to 
reduce running noise.

---

626
High precision and rigidity
The URB linear bushing is reduced from a solid 
steel outer cylinder and incorporates an industrial 
strenght resin retainer.
Ease of assembly
The standard type of URB linear bushing can 
be loaded from any direction. Precision control is 
possible using only the shaft supporter, and the 
mounting surface can be machined easily.
Ease of replacement
URB linear bushing od each type are completely 
interchangeable because of their standardized 
dimensions 
and 
strict 
precision 
control. 
Replacement because of wear or damage is 
therefore easy and accurate.
Variety of types
URB off ers a full line of linear bushing: The 
standard, integral single - retainer closed type, 
the clearance adjustable type and the open type. 
The user can choose from among these according 
to the application requirements to be met.

that are spaced equally and circumferentially. 
The load rating varies according to the loaded 
position on the circumference.

Clearance and fi t
When a standard-type URB linear bushing 
is used with a shaft, inadequate clearance, 
adjustment may cause early bush failure and/or 
poor, rough traveling.
The clearance adjustable linear bush and open 
linear bush can be clearance adjusted when 
assembled in the housing which can control the 
outside cylinder diameter. However, too much 
clearance adjustment increases the deformation 
of the outside cylinder, to aff ect its precision and 
life. Therefore, the appropriate clearance between 
the bush and shaft, and clearance between the 
bush and housing are required according to the 
application. Table 7 shows recommended fi t of 
the bush:

Note. The clearance may be zero or negative. 
Please attention the movement.
Shaft and housing
To optimize performance of the URB linear 
bushing high precision of the shaft and housing 
is required.
Shaft
The rolling balls in the URB linear bushing are 
in point contact with the shaft surface. Therefore, 
the shaft dimensions, tolerance, surface fi nish and 
hardness greatly afect the travelling performance 
of the bush. The shaft should be manufactered 
with due attention to the following points:
- Since the surface fi nish critically aff ects smooth 
rolling of balls, grind the shaft at 1,5 S or better.
- The best hardness of the shaft is HRC 60 to 
64; Hardness less than HRC 60 decreases the life 
considerably, and hence reduces the permissible 
load. On the other hand, hardness over HRC 64 
accelerates ball wear.
- The shaft diameter for the clearance adjustable 
linear bush and open linear bush should as much 
as possible be of the lower value of the inscribed 
circle diameter in the specifi cation table. Do not 
set the shaft diameter to the upper value.
- Zero clearance or negative clearance increases 
the frictional resistance slightly. If the negative 
clearance is too tight, the deformation of the 
outside cylinder will become larger, to shorten 
the bush life.
Housing
There is a wide range of housing diff ering in 
design, machining and mounting. For the fi tness 
and shapes of housing see in table 8 and the 
folowing section on mounting.
Mounting
When inserting the linear bush into the bushing 
do not hit the linear bush on the side ring holding 
the retainer but apply the cylinder circumference 
with a proper jig and push the linear bush into the 
housing by hand or lightly knock it in. In inserting 
the shaft after mounting the bush, be careful not 
to shock the balls. Note that if two shafts are used 
in parallel, the parallelism is the most important 
factor to assure the smooth linear movement. 
Take care in setting the shafts.

---

629
Exemples of mounting
The popular way to mount a linear bush is to 
operate it with an appropriate interference. It 
is recommended, however, to make a loose fi t 
in principle because otherwise precision is apt 
to be minimized. The following examples show 
assembling of the inserted bush in terms of 
designing and mounting for reference.

Slewing bearings are manufactured in a wide 
range of constructive designs, with various 
dimensions. We further mention the most usual 
bearing sizes:
Slewing bearings

Slewing bearings can take over heavy axial 
loads with megnitudes up to 10% of the axial 
loads and also tilting moments.
Prefi xes
If other materials than heat treatment steels 
are used, the prefi xes are the same as in case of 
standardized bearings (see page 76).

Designation
These bearings are diff erently designated, in 
comparison to the internationally standardized 
bearings. In case of the bearings manufatured 
by URB, the designation consists of:

---

643
Example of designation:
VI.10.1380ATNF81  Slewing ball bearing (V) 
with internal gear (I) sigle 
row balls (10), with ball 
centers circle diameter of 
1380 mm, design (A), with 
plactics distance rings (TN) 
between balls and surface 
hardened gear (F81).
Design
Slewing bearings consist of one or two inner 
rings and one or two outer rings made generally 
of heat treatment alloy steels 41MoCr11, 
according to the national standard STAS 791. To 
obtain an increased strenght, the semi-fi nished 
rings are quenched and tempered.
The rolling elements (balls or rollers) are placed 
between the two rings. They are manufactured 
of bearings steels and are separated by steel or 
plastics (TN) distance rings. 
To avoid the foreign bodies to penetrate the 
bearings, these are sealed with rubber seals or, 
sometimes, with labyrinth seales.
Lubrication during operation is provided by 
greasers either on the outer ring or on the inner 
ring. Their emplacement is simply designated by 
the symbol “`“.  
These bearings can also be manufactured with 
gear on the outer or inner ring, depending on 
application. Gear material can be only quenched 
and tempered or high frequency surface 
hardened.
The raceways of these bearings are also high 
frequency surface hardened. Ready made 
slewing bearings are protected against corrosion 
by painting all surfaces, excepting the gear which 
is coated with a thin uniform layer of grease. 
Usually, these surfaces are coated with ground. 
In this case, the user will paint the bearing after 
mounting with the same colour as the equipment.
Slewing bearings are fastened to the rotating 
assemblies by screws. For this purpose, there are 
some holes provided in the rings.
Fastening screws
The screws used for bearing fastening should 
be selected from the groups of mechanical 
characteristics 8.8, 10.9 or even 12.9.
The passing hole diameter for screws, clamping 
load and tightening torque are given in table 1.

screw, the nut frontal surface and its adjoint part,

the actual value of the nut tightening torque 
can be approximated to 90% of the theoretical 
tightening moment.
Considering that the extension of the screws 
with dimensions greater than M30 cannot be well 
enough controlled by the tightening torque, they 
should be tightened until the value of 70% of the 
material yield limit reached.
Screw extension can be checked by means of a 
device as shown in the fi gure below.
Tolerance and clearance
The tolerances of slewing bearings are not 
standardized. Maximum ovalness for external 
gear and minimum ovalness for internal gear are 
marked with colour on three neighboring teeth. 
The value of ovalness depends on the bearing 
size, section and heat treatment.
Slewing bearings are manufactured with radial 
and axial clearance which should be according 
to the values given in table 2. These clearances 
are theoretical values and are determined 
considering the median sizes of the component 
parts, which are measured before mounting. 
(Raceway mean diameters and rolling elements 
emplacement mean diameters).
Basic static axial load
Basic static axial load can be calculated 
depending on the bearing type, using the 
following equations:

Transport and storing
Considering the specifi c features of these 
bearings, their dimensions respectively wich 
exceed in most cases 1 meter and reach even 
more than 5 meters, some special conditions 
are required for transport and storing. The 
main condition which have to be observed 
during transport is to fasten all bearing parts so 
that no clearance should exist between them. 
Thus, contact imprints, which have detrimental 
infl uence on bearing operation and its rating 
life, will be avoided. These bearings should 
be transported and stored only in horizontal 
position. Shocks should be avoided.
Mounting of slewing bearings
Special care should be given while mounting 
these bearings.
The fl atness of surface on which bearings are 
to be mounted should be checked by means of 
a thickness gauge set, after the slewing bearings 
has been placed on the mounting surface.
When mounting the bearing, the non-hardened 
area of the raceway (the distance between the 
begining and end of the high-frequency, surface 
hardened area) should be considered. It is marked 
by “C“ on the outside or inner surface of both 
rings.
This part of bearing must be outside the 
maximum loaded area. The place where the pitch 
diameter of gear has maximum ovalness, in case 
of external gear and minimum ovalness, in case 
of internal gear, which are marked with paint on 
three neighboring teeth should be mounted near 
the diff erential-drive pinion. The permissible and 
type are given in table 5.

After suitable bearing placing the fastening 
screws should be tightened until the above 
mentioned values of force and moment are 
reached following the succession shown below 
(see table 1). A dynamometrical wrench can be 
used for tightening.

Lubrication and maintenance
At delivery (if no special prescriptions mentioned) 
bearings will be lubricated with grease U 170 Li 2, 
national standard STAS 8961 both on raceways 
and gear. The fi rst relubrication of raceways and 
gear should be done immediately after mounting. 
Plenty of grease should be used in order to create 
a continuous layer all over the circumference and 
also a grease rib under seals or labyrinth.
Grease is necessary to be uniformly distributed. 
For that reason, bearing should rotate during 
lubrication. The relubrication interval should be 
chosen depending on the operatings as follows: for 
ball bearings it is generally of 100 operating hours 
and for roller bearings of 50 operating hours. In 
tropical and high moisture environment and in case 
of continuous rotating movement relubrication 
should be done once in a week. Lubrication can 
be less frequent in case of turning machines, e.g. 
road trailers, tram bogie joints. Relubrication is 
absolutely necessary before and after a long non-
operating period, especially during winter-time. 
Water should be prevented from penetrating to 
the raceways, while cleaning the machinery. Then 
it must be greased abundantly. No further control 
is necessary excepting the periodical control of 
fastening screws.
Slewing bearings in applications.
Selection of bearing type
Slewing 
bearings 
are 
used 
in 
various 
applications, such as motor cranes, harbour 
cranes, hydraulic excavators, various totatng 
platforms, 
siderurgical 
equipments, 
bogies 
for metropolitan and tram cars, manipulators, 
foundry equipments etc.
Beside bearing dimensions and technical data, 
in this catalogue one can also fi nd diagrams 
showing the tilting moment and limit values of 
static loads which are helpful when selecting the 
proper bearing for certain operating conditions.
After calculating the force Fa and resultant 
moment Mr, the bearing is selected so that the 
intersection point of the values of resultant 
force Fa and moment Mr, to be placed under the 
respective curve (see the following example), 
also considering the screws used for bearing 
mounting on the assembly (strenght class 8.8, 
10.9 or 12.9).
Example
It is necessary to determine the type and size 
of a slewing bearing used for crane, as shown in 
the adjoint fi gure. The bearing has to support the 
following forces:
F1 = 3 x 104 N 

l1 = 45 m
F2 = 0,8 x 104 N 

l2 = 20 m
F3 = 4 x 104 N 

l3 = 2 m
F4 = 1,2 x 104 N 

l4 = 12 m
F5 = 2 x 104 N 

l5 = 20 m
F6 = 2 x 104 N 

l6 = 1,5 m
F7 = 0,8 x 104 N

The values resulting from the calculation of 
crane load should be placed under the diagram 
of the bearing which is to be selected. In this case, 
the designation of one of the bearings which 
can support these loads is VI.10.1380TNF81. 
This bearing can be used with screws from the 
strenght class 8.8, in case 1. In case 2, when the 
value of the overload coeffi  cient is c = 1,25, the 
bearing should be tightened with screws from 
the class 10.9, as it results from the diagram on 
page 661.

Feature
The spherical outside surface ball bearings of 
URB are deep groove ball bearings with wide and 
narrow inner rings, consisting of insert bearings 
(SA200, SB200, UC200, UEL200, UK200, UCX00 
and UC300) and various housing. The type of 
bearing units are defi ned according to the 
diff erent mounting methods of the bearings to 
shafts: the set-screws type, the adapter type, the 
accentric locking collar type.
The URB housing are mainly casting housing. 
There are pressed steel plate housing as well 
align with ease during operation and can be 
conveniently mounted or dismounted.
The bearing units can operate satisfactorily 
under working conditions, especially for machines 
operating in dusty or muddy surroundings. Thus, 
they are widely used in agricultural, construction 
and transmission machineries, etc.
There are various types of sealing devices for our 
products, such as synthetic rubber seals, slinger 
with synthetic rubber seals and triple lip seals etc.
Suffi  cient lubricating grease has been put into 
the bearing during manufacturing, which can 
act as lubricating as well as rust proof. No more 
grease is needed to put in during the lubricating 
period when the bearings operate under normal 
conditions. Lubricating grease can be added from 
the fi ttings when the relubricate bearings operate 
under hard conditions.
The outer ring of the bearing, has spherical 
outside surface which can be fi tted to the 
concave spherical surface of the housing, and 
the fi t between them can be clearance fi t or 
interference fi t according to diff erent conditions. 
This 
combination 
provides 
self-alignment 
between the self-contained bearing and the 
housing, and compensates for a certain alignment 
errors or fl exing of the shaft when the bearing is 
in operation. This defi nitely increases the bearing 
service life.
Pillow blocks
Lubrication
The Spherical Outside Surface Ball Bearings 
of URB generally use CG-2 rust proof lithium 
based lubricating grease, with physical chemical 
properties shown in the following table 1. Grease 
iss fi lled in the spherical outside surface ball 
bearings during manufacturing.

The bearings usually operate below the 
temperature of 120ºC (the measuring temperature 
of the outer rings is 100ºC). Grease life reduction 
has to be taken into account when the bearing 
continues to operate at a temperature should not 
be lower than -30ºC.
The permissible speed of rotation is connected 
with the fi t between shaft and bearing. It is 
reconnected with the fi t between shaft and 
bearing. It is recommended that, under normal 
operating conditions, the fi t between the bearing 
and the shaft is h7. Looser fi t allowing lower speed 
is recommended when heavier load is applied.

Note:  The deviation from nominal taper are defi ned by the 
limits of (Δd1-Δd), where Δd1 is actual deviations of 
d1 from nominal diameter at the largest end of bore 
and Δd is actual deviation of d from bearing bore 
nominal diameter.

 d1 is obtained by the following formula: 

 d1 = d + 0.083333 B, where B is width of the bearing 
inner ring.

The nominal taper angle = 2º 23’9,4”.
Please refer to the fi gures 1.

Radial internal clearance of 
bearings
The radial internal clearance of the bearing for 
the unit is the same as the value of ISO 5753, the 
internal radial clearance for the spherical outside 
The load applied to the bearing operating under 
static or slow oscillating and rotating (n<10r/min) 
condition is defi ned as dynamic load.
The load capacity of the bearing is expressed by 
the basic dynamic load rating which is shown in 
the spherical outside surface ball bearing’s table.
Bearing Size selection
The bearing size is usually selected according 
to the required life and reliability under a 
specifi c type of load charged on the spherical 
outside surface ball bearing
surface ball bearing is usually greater than that 
for the same size of deep groove ball bearing. 
The clearance for the cylindrical bore bearing 
is shown in table 15, while the clearance for the 
tapered bore bearing is shown in table 16.

Under normal mounting, lubricating and 
maintaining conditions, the operating bearing 
will have fatigue fl aking due to the repeating 
action of variable load charged on the contact 
area between the rings and rolling elements. 
Generally, the fatigue fl aking is the cause of 
normal damage of rolling bearings. Therefore, the 
usual bearing life refers to the bearing fatigue life. 
The life of group of apparently identical bearings 
operating under a considerable dispersion. For 
this reason, the bearing life is closely connected 
with the damaging probability or the reliability 
requirement.
The radial rating load of ball bearing with 90% 
reliability and 500 hours minimum life is shown 
in fi gure 7.
Life: 
 The life of a rolling bearing is 
defi ned as the total number of 
revolution which the bearing is 
capable of enduring before the 
fi rst evidence of fatigue fl aking 
develops on any one rings or 
rolling elements.
Reliability: 
 The reliability is the percentage 
of the bearings of a group of 
apparently identical bearings 
operating 
under 
identical 
conditions which can expect 
to attain or exceed a certain 
defi ned 
life. 
The 
reliability 
of individual bearings is the 
probability of the bearing to 
attain or exceed a defi ned life.
Basic rating life:  For a group of apparently 
identical 
rolling 
bearings 
operating 
under 
identical 
conditions, the basic rating life 
is defi ned as the total number 
of revolutions that 90% of the 
bearings can be expected to 
complete or exceed.
Basic rating life
The fatigue rating life of spherical outside surface 
ball bearings is calculated by the following 
formula:
L

where:
L10  - basic rating life, 106r
P  
- basic dynamic load rating, N
N  
- equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
The basic dynamic load rating C is a hypothetical 
constant load with a fi xed direction under which 
the bearing can attain a basic life of one milion 
revolutions theoretically. For radial bearings, the 
load refers to the radial load.
The equivalent dynamic bearing load P is a 
constant load with a fi xed direction under which 
the bearing life is identical to that of the bearing 
operating under actual load.
For a bearing operating with a constant rotation 
speed, the basic rating life can be expressed in 
terms of operating hours:

the anticipated bearing service life L10h. Then, 
with the radial load (or the equivalent dynamic 
bearing load), the basic dynamic load rating can 
be determined according to the spherical outside 
surface ball bearing’s table. If the bearing operate

the following formula should be applied when

Anticipated bearing service life
When 
selecting 
a 
bearing, 
one 
should 
usually predetermine an appropriate service 
life according to the relevant machine type, 
operating condition and reliability requirement. 
Generally the anticipated bearing service life can 
be determined by refering to the maintenance 
period of a machine.
Calculating method of equivalent dynamic 
bearing load P.
The basic equivalent dynamic bearing load 
is determined under a hypothetical condition. 
When calculating the bearing life, the actual load 
has to be converted to dynamic bearing load 
which is in conformity with the load condition 
determining the dynamic load rating. General 
equation for calculating the equivalent dynamic 
bearing load:
P = XFr + YFa,
where:
P  - equivalent dynamic bearing load, N
Fr  - actual radial load, N
Fa  - actual axial load, N
X  - radial factor
Y  - thrust factor
The values of X and Y are determined by the 
ratio between the applied axial load Fa and the 
basic static load rating C0. The axial load which 
the spherical outside surface ball bearing can 
carry is determined by the mounting method of 
the bearing on the shaft.
For bearing of set-screw Locking  type or 
eccentric Locking collar type, if fl exible shafts are 
applied and the set-screws are tightened enough, 
the axial load Fa which the bearings can carry not 
surpass 20% of the radial load Fr.
For bearing of adapter sleeve Locking type, if 
the nut is properly tightened, the axial load Fa can 
be maximally 15% to 20% of the radial load.
The value of radial and thrust factors X and Y 
for spherical outside surface ball bearings can be 
obtained from the following Table 17.
When twist load is applied to the bearing, the 
equivalent dynamic bearing load is calculated by 
the following equation: 
Pm = fmP
where:
Pm  -  equivalent dynamic bearing load when 
considering twist load
fm  -  twist load factor, which is defi ned as 
follows:

-  when the twist load is small: fm = 1,5

-  when the twist load is big: fm = 2
Example of bearing size selection
When shocking load is applied to the bearing, 
the equivalent dynamic bearing load can be 
calculated by the following equation:
Pd = fdP
where:
Pd  -  equivalent dynamic bearing load when 
considerating shocking load
fd -  shocking load factor, which is defi ned as 
follows:

-  when no shocking load or mirror shocking 
load is applied: fd = 1-1,2

-  when adequate shocking load is applied: 
fd = 1,2 - 1,8
How to select the size of bearing: one spherical 
outside surface ball bearings is to operate at a 
rotation speed of 1000r/min under only a radial 
load of Fr = 3000 N, with a basic rating life of a 
least 20,000 hours.
Select the bearing size
From the required rotation speed it can be 
found that: fn = 0,322 (fi gure 7 shows about 0,32, 
refer to page 689).
From the required basic rating life (anticipated 
service life), it can be found that:
fh = 3,42 (fi gure 7 shows about 3,4, refer to page 
689).
Under only radial load, i.e.
P = Fr = 3000 N
Therefore,

A simplifi ed way to calculate the bearing life can 
be applied by using fi gure 8.

---

696
By connecting n and the required basic rating 
life L10h with a straight line, it can be found that 
C/P value is 10,6.
As is know, P = Fr = 3000 N, thus the required 
basic dynamic load rating is:
C = 3000 x 10,6 = 31,800, N
In this way, we can select the shperical outside 
surface ball bearings inside this catalogue (refer 
to pages 148-160).
Adjusted rating life equation
The basic rating life L10 calculated with bearing 
life calculation formula can be applied to calculate 
the rating life of bearings made of ordinary 
bearing steel (i.e. bearing life with reliability of 
90%)
Due to more and more of machinery products 
demanding higher reliability and better quality 
steel (ISO 281/1-1977), an adjusted rating life 
calculation equation is suggested. i.e.
Ln = a1 a2 a3 L10
For spherical outside surface ball bearing:
Ln = a1 a2 a3 (C/P)3
where:
Ln  -  under specifi ed material and lubricating 
conditions, bearing life with (100-n)% no 
breaking probability (i.e. reability).
a1  -  life adjustment factor for reability (table 
18)
a2  -  life adjustment factor materials (table 19)

Selection of shaft
The shaft on which bearing units are mounted 
shall be free from band and fl exure.
For the units with cylindrical bore (with set-
screws or eccentric locking collar) clearance fi t 
is usually adopted for mounting the units on 
the shaft, and shaft tolerances in table 21 are 
recommended for such loose fi t, but for high 
speed or highly accurate operation or such 
application which is accompanied by heavy shock 
loads, interference fi t is to be adopted. Table 22 
shows recommended shaft with inerference fi t, 
the eccentric locking collar may omitted.
Tapered bore bearings permit wider tolerances 
of the shaft since they are locked to the shaft by 
means of adapted sleeves.
Recommended shaft tolerances for tapered 
bore bearings listed in table 23.

Bearings units with adapter sleeve
Bearing unit with adapter sleeve permits wider 
shaft tolerance and can be used in applications 
where vibrations and shocks are heavly.
Mounting processes of these units as follows:
First, the sleeve is instaled to an arbitrary 
position. After the shark proof washer is inserted, 
the nut is tightened.
The proper nut tightening condition can be 
obtained if it is tightened enough by hand and 
then rotated by 2/5 to 3/5 revolution with a 
spanner.
After tightening the nut, bend the shark proof 
washer within the slot. Otherwise, the nut may be 
loosened and  creep may be caused between the 
shaft and sleeve. It is necessary the nut can not be 
tightened too much.
Bearings units with eccentric locking collar
The eccentric part of the collar mates with the 
inner ring of the bearing which is made eccentric 
with the collar. When locked to the shaft by hand 
in direction of the shaft rotation, the eccentric 
locking collar tightens automatically to the shaft 
by force of working radial load. Then, lock the set-
srews provided on the collar to fi x the eccentric 
collar to the shaft. At the shaft rotation force or 
load is not charged on the set-screws directly, it 
will not loosen during operation.
Fig. 9
Mounting of bearing units on shaft
The bearing units can be easy installed in 
principle at any place. However, in order to have a 
long service life, it is desirable that the mounting 
base if fl at and rigid.
In case of either the vibration is caused to the 
bearing, the alternating movement takes place, 
the load applied to the bearing is large, or the 
shaft rotation speed is rapid, it is desired to 
provide with the fi led seat or concave section 
at the part where the set-screws contact with 
the shaft. If large thrust load is charged, it is 
recommended that joggling tightened with nuts 
be used to install the bearing most eff ectively to 
the shaft: as shown in fi gure 9.

Plummer blocks
Feature
The majority of URB plummer block housing 
is made of gray cast iron and is of the models 
of SN, SNU and SAF. Its basic size conforms with 
ISO standard and could meet the requirement 
of bearing with inner ring of 20 mm - 160 mm. 
It could not be interchangeable with the other 
parts of the housing cap or the housing base. Two 
parts through the fi xing "pins" to ensure their 
correct assembly.
Materials
Housing
Grade 200 (FC200), it is equivalents to U.S.A 
standard ASTM A-48 (Grade 35).

Lubrication
SN and SNU plummer block housing usually 
uses grease for lubrication. During instalation 
or 
periodic 
maintenance, 
the 
lubricating 
grease added is able to ensure that before next 
maintenance a good lubricating condition could 
be maintained. Lubricating grease usually uses 
lithium grease. The suitable temperature range 
is -30°C to +120°C. The fi lling quantity is 1/3 
of the inner body of the housing base after the 
installation of the bearing. The normal usage life 
of the lubricating grease is 6 months. Upon expiry 
all the lubricating grease should be replaced.
When the plummer block housing is under 
high temperature, great speed or heavy loading 
working enviroment, constant replacement of 
the lubricating grease is necessary. At this time, 
grease nipple is required at the housing cap.
The permitted loading capacity 
(SN, SNU)
The permitted loading capacity os SN, SNU 
plummer block housing are related to the loading 
capacity and the strenght of the bolt-screws. 
Under normal circumstances, plummer block 
housing is applicable to axial load. When the 
loading is from other directions, apart from axial, 
a check should be carried out to see the bolt-

screws between the housing cap and the housing 
base, between the frame.
When working out the permitted loading 
capacity, the safety factor should be considered. 
In normal engineering, the safety factor of bolt-
screw is 3. The safety factor of breaking loading 
capacity of the housing is 6.
The reference value of the breaking loading 
capacity of housing in diff erent directions and 
the maximum loading capacity of bolt-screw is 
set out in below fi gure 1. The maximum loading 
capacity of plummer block housing could select 
P180° direction 2/3 of the breaking loading 
capacity. When the loading direction exceeds 90°, 
bolt screws should be fastened evenly with the 
housing set out in the table 6.
When the loading capacity direction is between 
55° to 120° and face the axial load, the plummer 
block housing should be installed end-cover 
follow the axial direction or pin should be added 
between the housing base and frame.
Nipple hole
SN, SNU plummer block housing will not 
supply grease nipple upon delivery under usual 
circumstances. If customer requests, we could 
supply according to the size / specifi cation and 
please refer to table 8.
Seals
URB will usually provide customers with 2 kinds 
of standard of seals. SN plummer block housing 
uses felt seal. SNU plummer block housing uses 
U-ring seal.
SN plummer block housing using felt seal 
is a simple but reliable one. It is of a contact / 
brushing type. It is suitable for -30°C to +100°C 
temperature. The perimeter contact rate is less

a loose fi t of the bearing outer ring is assured 
and generally the seating width is such that the 
bearings has axial freedom. Instalation of the 
locating rings: in case of one ring to be fi xed on 
the side with the sleeve nut. The symbol of the 
locating ring is SR. When customer place orders 
for it should state clearly the specifi cation, size

soaked in hot oil for several minutes.
SNU plummer block housing uses U-ring seal is 
made of NRB plus mild steel plate. Complete U-ring 
is made of two equal halves. U-ring seal has 2 thin 
lips having close contact with the machine shaft 
surface. It is suitable for temperature between 
-30°C to +100°C. The perimeter contact speed 
is less than 8 m/sec applicable situation. During 
instalation, lubricating grease should be added 
into the space between the two rings. Beside, the 
contact surface between machine shaft and two 
lips should be polished before hand.
To avoid oil leakage, during installation one 
layer of very thin silicon should be placed on the 
two surfaces.

Cam Rollers
Standards, Boundary dimensions
Standard plans 

DIN 616
General
Cam Rollers are non - separable radial bearings. 
They are special variants of either radial deep 
groove bearings or double row angular 
contact ball bearings.
Cam roller run either directly on a guide track 
or against a surface that has been machined for 
a guidance.
To achieve this cam rollers feature an extra 
thick - walled outer ring this enables cam roller to 
accept high radial forces, including shock loads.
As cam rollers often run misaligned they are 
generally used with crowned outer ring syrfaces.
Cam rollers normally run outside the machi-
ne compartment, under extreme operating 
conditions, in the presence of heavy contamina-
tions (i.e. dust and dirt, etc).
For this reason, cam rollers are produced and 
fi tted with contacting seals.
Some types of the Double Row cam rollers are 
also available with shields.
Design variants 

(see also drawings on following pages)
Cam rollers are readily available in several 
design variants. For the most common designs 
see  drawings on page 810.
Single Row Cam Rollers
Cam rollers of the narrow series (series 3612.. 
and 3612.. R, are based on the proven sealed 
single row deep groove ball bearings, (suffi  x .2RS) 
for their internal design.
The URB cam rollers, series 3612.. and 
3612..R, respectively, are produced with .2RS. 
- type contacting seals as standard. These seals 
provide a very eff ective and effi  cient sealing of 
the bearing compartment against penetration 
by foreign particles even under unfavourable 
operating conditions.
The narrow URB cam rollers, series 3612 are 
available with either cylindrical (without extra 
suffi  x) or crowned outer ring diameter (suffi  x R) 
as standard.
The radius of crowning on single row cam rollers 
for the series 3612.. R, is standardised at R = 400 
mm, irrespective of their outer diameter.
Double Row Cam Rollers
The internal design of URB double row cam 
rollers (series 305 and 306) are based on the 
double row angular contact ball bearings of the 
series 32.. (for series 305) or 33.. (for series 306 
cam rollers), respectively.
URB double row cam rollers have contact 
angles of 25° they also feature polyamide cages 
as standard.
Double row cam rollers are widely used with 
pressed steel shields, (suffi  x .2Z), they are also 
available with rubbing seals (suffi  x .2RS) as 
standard.
As for single row rollers, URB double row cam 
rollers are produced with either a, cylindrical or 
sphered outer ring diameters.
The radius of crowning of double row cam roller 
outer diameter is also standardised at R = 400 
mm.
Material of seals
For the contacting seal of sealed URB - cam 

---

810
rollers (suffi  x .2RS) a wear - resistant synthetic 
rubber (NBR) is used as standard material.
This seal material is suitable for operating 
temperatures of -30°C up to +120°C.
On request, the URB - cam rollers are supplied 
with alternative seal materials, such as high - 
temperature FPM - contacting seals.
Grease fi lling
URB cam rollers incorporating either seals or 
shieds (suffi  xes) are supplied grease fi lled from 
the factory with a proven high quality, lithium 
soap based rolling bearing grease suitable for 
operating temperatures of -30°C up to +110°C.
Although cam rollers, operating under normal 
conditions, run generally maintenance free.
Some application require additional lubrication 
where high speeds, heavy dust, permanent 
operating temperatures over 70°C exist.
Double Row cam rollers only feature a 
lubrication hole in the inner rings to provide a 
simple and eff ective relubricating method.
Where relubrication is necessary, it is emphasised 
that, undue pressure by the regreasing metgod 
may cause unnecessary damage to either the 
seals or shields.
URB cam rollers are be supplied with special 
grease fi lles according to customer specifi cation 
or with varialbe grease fi ll volumes than the 
standard.

811
Equivalent static bearing load
For Cam rollers: 
P0 = Fr
But, P0 must be ≤ F0r zul
(for F0r zul see product tables)
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for cam 
rollers
The bearing inner ring must contact adjacent 
surfaces with their side faces only. The radius of 
inner ring corners must not touch the fi llet radius 
of the shaft shoulder.
Therefore, the largest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of the 
cam roller inner rings (rs) as listed in the product 
tables.
Since cam rollers normally have point loaded 
inner rings, their shaft fi ts may be rather loose, 
(i.e. according to ISO - tolerance fi elds g6, h6 or 
j6).
Cages
Single Row Cam Rollers are standard fi tted 
with pressed steel cages as standard. Double 
Row Cam Rollers feature solid polyamide cages 
as standard.
Tolerances
URB cam rollers, with cylindrical outer ring 
diameter, are produced to normal class tolerances 
(PN) as standard.
For cam rollers with sphered outer ring 
diameters the outer ring diameter tolerance is 
double the standard value.
For detailed tolerance values see in the chapter 
"Bearing tolerances" page 27.
Internal clearance
URB cam rollers are produced with normal 
internal clearance group (CN) as standard 
according to DIN 620.
URB cam rollers are also produced to other 
internal clearances.
Load carrying capability
Unlike the "normal" rolling element bearings, 
the outer ring of cam rollers contact their adjacent 
mating surface on a very small contacting area, 
this causes deformations of the outer ring.
These 
deformations 
are 
considered 
by 
the recommanded maximum values for the 
permissible dynamic and static radial loads as 
shown in by the product tables.
Equivalent dynamic load
Cam rollers must be calculated as rolling 
element bearings: 
P = Fr
But, P must be ≤ Fr zul
(for Fr zul see product tables)

Support rollers
Standards, Boundary dimensions
Standard plans 

DIN 616
General
Support Rollers are either needle roller or 
cylindrical roller bearings with an extra radially 
thick outer ring. Depending on their series, 
support rollers may be both separable and non - 
separable radial bearings.
Support Rollers usually run with their outer 
ring either directly on a guide track or against a 
machine surface that is for guidance. Due to their 
extra - thick outer rings, Suport rollers are able to 
accept high radial forces as well as shock loads.
Their ability to accomodate axial forces, 
however, depends on the particular design of the 
support roller.
Support roller are usually exposed to minor 
misalignments during operation. To minimize 
the negative eff ects of such misalignments, (e.g. 
high edge stresses), support rollers are more 
frequently used with sphered outer rings.
URB - support rollers with parallel (cylindrical) 
outer diameters are indicated by the suffi  x "X".
Design variants
In order to cover as many applications as 
possible, URB Support rollers are available in 
several diff erent design variants as standard.
To provide simple re-lubrication, all suport roller 
have lubrication holes in their inner rings.
For the most common design are shown in the 
fi gures on the pages 820 and 822.
Support Rollers without axial guidance
The most simple design of support rollers is 
provided by the STO - type rollers.
For these rollers the outer ring, inner ring and 
the needle roller and cage assembly may be fi tted 
separately. Since STO - type support rollers do not 
provide any axial guidance to their needle roller 
and cage assembly they adequately accept radial 
loads only.
The axial guidance of outer ring and needle 
roller and cage assembly must be provided by a 
suitable design of adjacent machine parts.
STO - Type suport rollers are frequently used 
without their inner rings, namely RSTO - rollers. 
The needle roler and cage assembly of RSTO - 
type support rollers run directly onto the shaft 
surface, which must be designed in an adequate 
manner, (e.g. hardened and ground).
For detailed guide lines on the design of 
bearing raceways on shafts see chapter "Bearing 
application" on page 45.
STO and RSTO - type support rollers are the only 
support rollers that are satisfactory for operating 
with oil lubrication.
Unlike the STO - type support rollers, the outer 
ring, and the needle rollers and cage assembly of 
series NA 22 ..2RS build a unit, whilst the inner 
ring may be dealt with individually.
NA 22 ..2RS - type support rollers also 
accomodate radial loads only. They also require 
adequate axial guidance of their outer rings by 
adjacent parts.
Due to the contact seals, which are integrated 
in their outer rings, NA 22 ..2RS - type support 
rollers provide the possibility for maintenance - 
free bearing arrangements.

---

820

---

821
Sealed support rollers, without inner rings, are 
also produced, namely RNA 22...2RS.
For these types both the needle rollers and the 
rubbing seals run on the contacting shaft surface. 
Support Rollers with axial guidance
These types of supporting rollers are also to 
accommodate additional thrust loads as they 
occur, due to aligning errors or if rollers run out 
of line.
That is why no extra external guiding surfaces 
are required.
Where high axial loads are anticipated eff ective 
axial support of side washers must be achieved 
by the adjacent machine components.
Support rollers, type STO..2Z
STO...2Z - type support rollers are designed 
similar to the STO - type but have two loose side 
plates to accept axial forces.
These types of support rollers are separable, this 
enables simple mounting of the rollers due to the 
separable parts.
Particular attention must be paid to the 
adequate axial camping of loose side washers 
during mounting.
The side plates of STO...2Z - type support rollers 
must not have any axial play when they are 
mounted.
Support rollers, type NATR
The side washers of NATR - type needle roller 
support rollers are pressed into the inner ring to 
ensure guidance of the outer ring and the needle 
roller and cage assembly.
Therefore, these roller types are non - separable. 
NATR - type needle roller support roller are 
optimum for applications where the rollers are 
exposed to high radial loads at high speeds.
The sealed support rollers, namely, NATR..
PP, which feature integrated rubbing seals on 
each side of the outer ring are very suitable for 
operating in harsh conditions (e.g. heavy dust, 
dirt and other contaminates).
Support rollers, type NATV
NATV-type rollers are identical to the NATR- 
type except they have no fi tted cage (i.e. full 
complement type).
This enables an increased numbers of needle 
roller to be fi tted in the available space (i.e. 
full circumferentially and radially). Therefore, 
signifi cantly higher "basic" load ratings are 
achived.
NATV type full complement rollers are 
unsuitable for high speed applications due to 
the diff ering kinematic operating condition. Also 
they must be re-lubricated more frequently.
For applications of harsh operating conditions 
the sealed support roller, namely, NATV...PP is 
also available.
NUTR - type support rollers
The base internal design of NUTR - type support 
rollers is similar to that of double row cylindrical 
roller bearings.
Since the outer ring has tow shoulders these 
support rollers are able to accommodate greater 
thrust loads.
NUTR - type support rollers are non separable.
The separate loose ribs of these type are 
retained using either cupped washers pressfi tted 
into the outer ring or with lamellar rings which sit 
in the formed circumferential grooves machined 
in the loose rib outer diameter.
Both methods also act as a gap seal.
Due to do their full complement design, NUTR - 
type support roller feature a maximum load rating 
but they must be more frequently re-lubrication.
For extra heavy duty applications, particularly 
where heavy shock loads occur NUTR - type 
support rollers are available with an extra - radialy 
thick walled outer ring (see sketch).
URB's extra heavy duty NUTR -type support 
rollers with increased outer ring wall thickness are 
identifi ed by the fact that their nominal diameters 
are included in their designation.
Examples: 

NUTR 1747
or

NUTR 50110.

All URB support rollers are produced with 
crowned outer ring diameter as standard they 
are also available with parallel (cylindrical) outer 
diameters indicated by the suffi  x "X", see the 
relevant designs.
Material of seals
Several types of URB support rollers, such as 
series NA22...2RS, NATR .. PP und NATV...PP are 
also available in sealed versions.
These support rollers feature contacting seals 
made from wear - rezistant synthetic rubber 
compound (NBR) that provides an effi  cient 
and eff ective seal against the penetration of 
impurities or the escape of grease.
The synthetic rubber used for these contacting 
seals is satisfactory for operation temperatures of 
-30°C up to +120°C.
Grease fi lling
All URB Support rollers are already supplied 
fi lled with a high quality, lithium - soaped bearing 
grease as standard.
This lubricant is adequate for operating 
temperatures of -30°C up to ca. +110°C. 
Although support rollers under normal operating 
conditions usually run maintenance - free, they 
may require more frequent re - lubrication under 
certain 
unfavourable 
operating 
conditions 
such as heavy dust, high speeds, permanent 
operating temperatures of more than 70°C, and 
the presence of increased humidity etc.
Therefore a URB support rollers feature a 
lubrication hole in the inner ring to provide the 
possibility of re-lubricating the rollers, when 
necessary.
It must be considered where relubrication is 
necessary, with a satisfactory grease, the force 
of pressure to re-grease must be of a level not to 
cause permanent damage to either the seals or 
shields.
URB also produce roller with alternative grease 
fi ll according to customer's specidication upon 
order request.
Cages
URB support rollers, with cages fi tted, have 
normally pressed steel cages as standard. Only 
small support rollers without axial guidance, 
series STO and RSTO, respectively, are fi tted with 
solid polyamide cages (suffi  x TN), as standard.
Tolerances
URB support rollers are produced to normal 
tolerance class (PN) as standard, according to DIN 
- standard DIN 620.
The exceptions being the outer ring outer 
diameter tolerance of crowned outer rings and 
the width tolerance of supporting roller of series 
STO ...2Z, NATR, NATV and NUTR.
The tolerance for the outer ring diameter of 
support rollers with sphered outer ring is uniform 
at:
0 / -0,05 mm
The width tolerance of support rollers of series 
STO ...2Z, NATR, NATV and NUTR is lateral and 
lies in the ISO - tolerance fi eld h12.
The tolerance for the inside diameter of the 
needle roller complement, (F), of RSTO and 
RNA 22...2RS - type support rollers that are used 
without inner rings, is lateral in the ISO - tolerance 
fi eld F6.
Values of ISO - tolerance fi eld F6 and h12 are 
listed in the table below. For detailed values 
of tolerances to DIN 620 see chapter "Bearing 
tolerances" page 27.
Internal Clearance
URB Support rollers are produced to normal 
internal clearance group (CN) as standard 
according to DIN 620.
Load carrying capability
Unlike "normal" rolling element bearings, the 
outer ring of support rollers contact the adjacent 
parts with a very small contacting surface only.

---

824

---

825
This causes deformations of the outer ring. 
These are considered by the recommended 
maximum values for the permissible dynamic and 
static radial loads as given by the product tables.
Equivalent dynamic load
Where Support rollers must be calculated as 
rolling element bearings:
P = Fr
But, P must be ≤ Fr zul
(for Fr zul see product tables)
Equivalent static bearing load
For Support rollers:
P0 = Fr
But, P0 must be ≤ F0r zul
(for F0r zul see product tables)
Design of adjacent machine 
components
For support rollers of the series STO, RSTO, 
NA22..2RS and RNA22..2RS, an eff ective axial 
guidance of the outer rings must be provided by 
satisfactory designed surrounding parts.
These guiding surfaces must have a clean and 
plain machined surface, minimum fi ne turned, 
without any burrs.
These guide surfaces which are machined 
should reach 50%, or greater, of the outer ring 
radial wall section or the equivalent diameter.
Hardened guide surfaces, however, feature 
a higher wear - resistance and may therefore be 
smaller in diameter.
RSTO and RNA22..2RS - type support rollers 
that run directly on a shaft require an axial play 
of 0,2 mm minimum between the lateral guiding 
surfaces in mounted condition.
The diameter of the supposed shaft raceway 
should have a diameter tolerance according to 
k5.
The shaft or pin have to fulfi l certain 
requirements in terms of hardness, dimensional 
and geometric accuracy.
For detailed information on the design 
requirements 
see 
the 
chapter 
"Bearing 
application" on page 45.
For support roller which are exposed to high 
axial loads, eff ective lateral support of their side 
washers is necessary.
Since Support rollers usually have point loaded 
inner rings, their shaft may be rather loose (i.e. 
according to ISO - tolerance fi elds g6, h6 or j6).
Abutment and Fillet dimensions for 
Support rollers
The bearing inner ring must contact adjacent 
surfaces with their side faces only. The fi llet radius 
of inner ring corners must not touch the fi llet 
radius of shaft shoulder.
Therefore, the largest fi llet radius (rg) must be 
smaller than the minimum fi llet dimension of 
the Support roller inner rings (rs) as listed in the 
product tables.

Rolling Elements
General
Rolling Elements are simple geometric bodies 
that are produced to very high precision standard 
by the rolling bearing industry.
Rolling elements are made from hardened 
bearing steel. They have fi ne ground or even 
superfi nished surfaces as standard. 
Rolling elements such as Balls, Cylindrical 
Rollers and Needle Rolers are used in a wide 
variety of Rolling Bearings for a whole spectrum 
of applications and industries.
Additional to the use in rolling bearings, 
individual rolling elements are frecquently used 
separately or loose for other requirements or 
applications, such as Valve Balls, Gauge Rollers, 
Cycles wheels etc.
The more popular sizes are normally available 
and supplied loose from stock.

Ball grades, Tolerances
URB balls from rolling bearing steel are supplied 
according to the following tolerances.
The balls are clasifi ed and graded according 
to their diameters, each grade is sorted into 
individual ball gauges, each gauge is separately 
packaged.
Each package is clearly identifi ed with ball 
diameter, grade and gauge. Where there are 
no specifi c grade and gauge requirements 
readily available standard ball diameters will be 
despatched.

Designation
Balls are classifi ed according to their diameters, 
each grade and gauge is separately packed and 
despatched.
URB balls made from chromium rolling bearing 
steel are designated following the system as 
shown below:
RB 12,7 G10 P4
where:
RB 
 Symbols for balls made from chromium 
rolling bearing steel
12,7 
Nominal ball diameter Dw [mm]
G10 
Grade G10
P4 
 Gauge P4 

 (the mean deviation of this specifi c lot 
equals +4 μm
To avoid possible misinterpretations by poor 
visible printings etc. the mean deviation is stated 
according to the following system:
P 
Plus

e.g. P4 = mean deviation + 4 μm
N 
0
M 
Minus

e.g. M3=mean deviation - 3 μm
Therefore, the mean diameter deviation of a ball 
from a specific lot is
12,704 mm ± 0,5 μm
For a ball with the designation RB 5,556 G3 M2, 
the mean diameter deviation would be:
5,554 ± 0,25 μm
Balls from other materials
Aditional to the balls produced from chromium 
bearing steel, URB also produce balls suitable for 
different purposes from alternative materials.
Examples are balls of:

mild steel, unhardened

stainless steel

bronze

brass, etc.
URB will provide detailed information on 
request.

Cylindrical Rollers
Standards, Boundary dimensions
Cylindrical rollers of Through-hardering
Rolling bearings steel DIN 5402/part 1
Hardness
URB cylindrical rollers made from through 
- hardened rolling bearing steel according to 
DIN 17 230 have a surface hardness of 58 up to 
65 HRC.
Design features
URB cylindrical rollers are produced using 
the latest technology, with the modifi ed surface 
profi le (i.e. semi-crowned) as standard (see sketch 
below).
This modifi ed profi le features a cylindrical 
centre diameter (A) that blends into a slightly 
curved area (B) which blends into the roller radii 
(r) and end face.
This feature reduces considerably the negative 
eff ect of edge loading and, therefore, additional 
stresses.
For manufacturing reasons, small cylindrical 
rollers may have shallow dimples in their end 
faces.
Such dimples have a depth of approximately 
0,5 mm, tthe diameter is approximately half the 
nominal roller diameter (DW).
In cases where such dimpled cylinfrical 
rollers are unsuitable for application reasons, 
it must be clearly stated on the order.

individual grade and gauge is separately packed 
and despatched.
URB Cylindrical Rollers made from chromium 
rolling bearing steel are designated following the 
system as shown below:
RC 6,5X9 P2/M6
where:
RC 
 Symbol for cylindrical rollers from 
chromium rolling bearing steel
6,5 
Nominal roller diameter, Dw [mm]
9 
Nominal roller length, Lw [mm]
P2 
Diameter gauge P2

 (the mean deviation of roller diameter 
of this specifi c lot  equals + 2 μm)
M6 
Lenght gauge M6

 (the mean deviation of roller lenght of 
this specifi c lot is - 6 μm)
To avoid possible misinterpretations by poor 
visible printings etc., the mean deviation is 
stated acording to the following system:
P 
Plus

e.g. P2 = mean deviation + 2 μm
N 
0
M 
Minus

e.g. M6 = mean deviation - 6 μm
Therefore, the mean diameter deviation of a 
cylindrical roller from this specifi c lot is
6,502 mm ±1 μm.
The mean roller length deviation of a 
cylindrical roller from a specifi c lot is
8,994 mm ±3 μm.
Cylindrical Rollers to other Tolerances
URB 
also 
produces 
cylindrical 
rollers 
with reduced tolerances to customer order 
requirements.
URB will provide detailed information on 
request.

Needle Rollers
Standards, Bondary dimensions
Needle rollers of through-hardened rolling 
bearing steel  

DIN 5402 / part 3
Hardness
URB - needle rollers made from through - 
hardened rolling bearing steel according to DIN 
17 230 generally, have a hardness value range of 
58 to 65 HRC.
Design features
URB Needler Rollers are produced using the 
latest technology.
One detail of outstanding importance to needle 
rollers is the modifi ed profi le that is established as 
a standard for all URB needle rollers, see sletch 
below.
The modifi ed profi le features a cylindrical 
section in the centre (A) that blends into a slightly 
curved area (B) which blends into the roller radii 
(r) and end face.
This feature reduces considerably the potentially 
negative eff ect of edge loading and, therefore, 
additional stresses.
Needle rollers are available in two diff erent 
designs as standard (see sketch below).
Needle rollers of type “B“ have spherical end 
faces, whilst needle rollers of the “BF” - design are 
produced with fl at ends.
Grades, tolerances
URB Needle rollers are classifi ed and graded 
according to their diameters into tharee Grades 
(G2, G3 and G5).
Furthermore, the needle diameters of every 
grade are subdivided in gauges.
The tolerance ranges of each gauge are diff erent 
depending on the grade.
Each package is clearly identifi ed with the 
nominal needle roller diameter, grade, individual 
gauge range and length.
Each gauge is packed and despached separately.
Where there is no specifi c grade and/or gauge 
requirements G2-Needle rollers from available 
stock sizes will be despatched.
The lenght tolerances of needle rollers 
correspond uniformly to ISO tolerance fi eld h13.

General
Adapter and Withdrawal Sleeves are devices 
using to mount and secure rolling element 
bearings with tapered bores onto cylindrical shaft 
seats.
This enables the mounting or dismounting of 
rolling element bearings in a simple and effective 
way to for a variety of applications.
Since, adapter and withdrawal sleeves are able 
to adapt to shaft diameter variations within 
certain limits, larger than normal shaft diameter 
tolerances are accomodated.
The geometrical accuracy, however, must be 
more closely defined, as the forms errors of the 
shaft affect the running accuracy of the total 
bearing arrangement in a direct way.
Furthermore, using adapter or withdrawal sleeves 
allows bearing seats with lower surface qualities, 
(e.g. turned surfaces) to be acceptable. For 
applications where no accurate shaft guidance 
of bearings is required, bright drawn round bar 
stock may also be used.
Generally the following tolerances may be used 
for guidance:

Adapter Sleeves 

DIN 5415
General
Adapter sleeves (see sketch below) are slotted 
steel sleeves that have a tapered outer diameter, 
taper 1:12 on one side and a thread on the 
opposite side.
Small adapter sleeves may have phosphated 
surfaces, normally they are only oil preserved.
URB adapter sleeves are supplied complete with 
lock nut and locking washer as standard.
Beside the standard design (see figure a), there 
are also larger adapter sleeves available with oil 
bores and oil distribution ducs, (prefix OH) as 
required for applying the oil injection method as 
shown in figure b.
On smooth straight shafts, (e.g. on a drawn round 
stock), adapter sleeves allow a simple positioning 
of bearings in any position, (see figure c).
In applications where bearings with adapter 
sleeves are mounted on straight shafts without 
axial support, (see figure c), their ability to accept 
axial forces is limited by the friction between the 
adapter sleeve and the shaft.
in the case of higher axial forces, the bearing 
needs to be secured additionaly by supporting 
rings (see figure d).
When designing such supporting rings, however, 
the abutment dimensions recommended by the 
product tables must be considered.

Withdrawal Sleeves
Standards, Boundary dimensions
Withdrawal Sleeves 
                  DIN 5416
General
Withdrawal sleeves (see sketch below) are 
slotted steel sleeves that have a tapered outer 
diameter on one side and a thread on the large 
diameter on the opposite side.
Standard withdrawal sleeves have tapered 
outers, taper 1:12 except for withdrawal sleeves 
of series AH 240 and AH 241 having tapers 1:30.
URB Withdrawal Sleeves are supplied without 
lock nut as standard.
URB Withdrawal Sleeves are produced in two 
diff erent designs as standard.
Beside the standard design (see fi gure a), larger 
withdrawal sleeves from bore diameter 200 mm 
onwards are also available with oil bores and oil 
distribution ducts as required for applying the oil 
injection method as shown in fi gure b.
URB withdrawal sleeves that are foreseen with 
facilities for an application of the oil injection 
method are designated "AOH..."
When withdrawal sleeves are used, the bearing 
inner ring must to be supported by an eff ective 
suface contact, such as a shaft shoulder, (see 
fi gure a). 
Where larger radii bearing journals and shaft 
shoulders are necessary for strenght reasons, (e.g. 
where such radii become larger than the bearing 
fi llet, suitable distance rings must be applied.
In each case the withdrawal sleeves must be 
secured against axial displacement loosening 
by means of lock nuts (see fi g. c) or end plates 
(see fi g. d).
