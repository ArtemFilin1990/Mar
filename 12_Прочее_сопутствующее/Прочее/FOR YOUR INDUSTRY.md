NEEDLE BEARINGS
These bearings are mainly selected for constructions requiring reduced radial 
dimensions and maximum rigidity and load capacity. They have little resistance for 
axial forces (except thrusts and combined bearings).
NEEDLE ROLLER AND CAGE ASSEMBLIES
A needle cage comprises an inseparable cage and needles and can be used to 
design very compact, light, constructions with maximum capacity. The shaft and 
housing act as a raceway and must be machined in compliance with hardness, 
geometry and roughness characteristics. The needles are guided precisely, therefore 
the needle cage can absorb much higher speeds of rotation than contact needles.
Depending on the application, different types of materials and cages are available:
Inch solutions are also available (PCJ).
DRAWN CUP NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS
Compact and light, mainly used in applications with low loads, needle sockets 
represent a low-cost bearing solution; the outer ring is not  machined, but is 
obtained using precision pressing processes. It must be noted that the geometry 
of the raceway depends on the geometry of the housing (the low thickness of the 
outer ring only provides the hardness and roughness necessary for the raceway).
Standard (HK) and heavy (HMK) series, available with or without sealing, with open or 
closed ends (BK, BMK)
Some dimensions are delivered with 2 rows of needles (-ZW)
Inches versions with cage (DCL, SCE) and contact needle versions (HCK).
NTN drawn cup needle roller bearing offer:
• simplified adapting thanks to an ideal geometry
• an improved service life: specific treatment of the cage and needles
NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS WITH SOLID RINGS
Needle roller bearings with solid rings are mainly used in applications with high 
loads. 
• Inseparable versions: with or without an inner ring
- Series 48, 49, 59 and 69. (Series 49 is also available with simple or double sealing)
- NK series: also deliverable with the inner ring (NK+IR designation)
If the bearing is used without an inner ring, the shaft will act as a raceway and must be 
machined appropriately

---

11
BEARINGS 
• Separable versions: RNAO and NAO
With these versions, the inner and outer rings and the cage can be separated, opening up more assembly options.
• The inner rings are delivered separately. 
Versions with plunge grinding for seal support surfaces are also available.
These solid rings and needle bearings are also available in inch dimensions. (MR,MI)
NEEDLE AND ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
Needle or roller thrust bearings are designed to absorb axial forces in one 
direction only. Support surfaces used as raceways must be ground and harde­
ned.
• Needle thrust bearings: type AXK11
• Roller thrust bearings: series 811, 812, 874 and 893
Available with Polyamide cage (-T2), Aluminium alloy cage (-: lightness and enhanced 
performance when lack of lubricant) or pressed steel cage.
• Washers:
- type AS11 washers are thin (1 mm), therefore their support surfaces must be flat and 
rigid enough
- types WS (centered on the shaft) and GS (centered on the housing) are more rigid
COMBINED BEARINGS
When the application requires resistance to forces combined with substantial 
rigidity or minimum room, the use of combined bearings can lead to benefits. 
Depending on the type of bearings, axial forces may be absorbed in one or two 
directions.
• Uni-directiona• axial forces 
The thrust part may comprise, either:
- a radial contact (NKX) or angular contact (NKIA) ball bearing  
- rollers for high axial loads (NKXR)
If the unit must be inseparable, a flange (-Z) is proposed
• Two-way axial forces 
Depending on the intensity of the forces, the trust part will consist of needles (AXN) 
or rollers (ARN)
CAM FOLLOWERS
Cam followers are used for applications requiring guidance with minimum 
contact with cam and the linear guidance systems.
Cam followers applications are very different to bearing applications. 
The cam followers is not fitted in a housing and its thicker outer ring rolls 
directly over a surface to provide guidance.
With or without a seal, with an outer ring with a convex or cylindrical profile, all cam followers are proposed:
- contact needle version (KRV-NATV) to accept significant loads
- cage version (KR-NATR) to accept higher speeds
Versions with two 2 rows of contact bearings also exist to increase capacity (NUTR, NUTW et NUKR)
- Stud Type: threaded shaft has a slot head or hex head screwdriver tightening system to simplify the attachment 
of the roller on the support surface. These rollers may be regreased by the shaft.
- Yoke Type: with or without lateral guidance

SPECIFIC RANGES
BEARINGS WITH SOLID LUBRICATION
Bearings with solid lubrication are manufactured under the NTN brand 
(SolidGrease) and the SNR brand (LubSolid). They require a special grease, 
solidified after injection in the bearings, which can retain a greater quantity 
of oil than standard grease, as necessary for the lubrication of the bearing 
during operation.
• No service
- Reduced, or even zero, servicing
- Less servicing for inaccessible bearings
• Resistance to contamination
- High performances in dusty and/or humid environments 
- The use of sealed bearings is recommended for applications with high levels of 
contamination. This type of lubrication can be used to improve  bearing sealing
• No grease leakage
- No grease leakage and low oil leakage: guaranteed clean operation
• Excellent resistance to centrifugal forces, vibrations and low-scale 
oscillations
Lubricant in the form of a solid mass, ensuring:
- excellent resistance to centrifugal forces
- the amount of oil necessary for satisfactory operation
• Low start-up torque
“SPOT PACK” type bearings: very low start-up torque at ambient temperature

BEARINGS WITH INTEGRATED SENSORS
Integration of a speed and/or position measuring function, in the bearing function
Basis bearing: LU sealed version (unilateral), greased. A magnetic encoder is fitted 
opposite the seal on the inner ring, with a sensor on the outer ring.
The sensor detects the magnetic variations induced by the rotation of the encoder. 
The sensor then emits an output signal, enabling the electronics to recalculate 
the speed of rotation.
By modifying the type of magnetic encoder, it is also possible to measure 
angular position.

TENSION LEVELLER
Complete assemblies equipped with low-torque bearings and with a ground outer diameter. 
CU type leveller cylinders can be used to absorb radial and axial loads thanks to angular contact ball 
bearings, while maintaining high rotational precision and compatibility with high speeds.
• Equipped with baffle-type low-torque seals
• For higher loads, these components can be equipped with needle bearings (type NKZ) enabling an increase in load 
capacity for the entire assembly while maintaining very high rotational precision and a compact format.
Cylinder lengths are adapted to each application based on a standard range of defined diameters.
SPLIT BEARING
For some applications, it is not possible to fit traditional bearings, split bearings must be used.
Mounting, dismounting and maintenance are all simplified.
Possible variants
- Cylindrical roller bearings
- Spherical roller bearings 
- Needle cages, needle bearings
- Complete bearing units equipped with cylindrical roller bearings with no cage for steel and iron units
