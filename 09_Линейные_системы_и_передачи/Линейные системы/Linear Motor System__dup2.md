Technical
1.1	 Glossary
Back emf constant (K v)
This is the ratio of the back emf voltage (rms) to the motor rotational speed or linear speed (rpm or m/s). The 
back emf is the electromagnetic force, which is created 
at the movement of the coil in the magnetic field of permanent magnets, e.g. in a servo motor.
This is the speed change per time unit, i.e., acceleration 
= speed / time or a = v / t.
Acceleration time
This is defined as the time a drive requires from start 
until achieving maximum speed.
Vertical straightness
The measure of straightness when moving in X-axis. If 
there is deviation in vertical straightness, there would be 
positioning error in Z-axis, as the system moves along Xaxis.
Torque
This is a measurement of the rotational movement in a 
body and consequently a vectorial direction that can be 
expressed in the following cross product:
The torque is expressed in the equation Nm = kg x m²/s².
Repeatability
Repeatability should not be confused with absolute accuracy. A linear axis can have medium accuracy, but have 
good repeatability. Uni-directional repeatability can be 
measured in a way, that a target position is approached 
multiple times from an appropriately distance and the 
same approaching direction. In this way, the backlash 
will not have any effect. For measurement of bi-directional repeatability, the target position is approached 
from different directions, in which case the backlash will 
take effect.
Motor constant (K m) 
This designates the ratio of generated force and 
dissipation power,represents the efficiency of the motor. 
Stiffness
This corresponds to the mechnical resistance to deformation a part or an assembly can provide under external 
static payload. (static stiffness) Or, it is the elastic resistance to deformation a part or an assembly can provide 
under external dynamic payload. (dynamic stiffness)
Horizontal straightness
The measure of straightness when moving in X-axis. If 
there is deviation in horizontal straightness, there would 
be positioning error in Y-axis, as the system moves along 
X-axis.
Guide deviation
This is the deviation from the axis of stroke. It depends 
on horizontal straightness (also straightness) and vertical straightness (also flatness).
Force, torque
Force (in linear movements) or torque (in rotational movements) is given for defined conditions, e.g., as continuous force or torque at:
 20 °C ambient temperature
 80 °C winding temperature
 100% rate of loading(duty cycle)
or as peak force or peak torque.
Force constant (K f)
This is a coil specific constant. The motor output force 
can be calculated by multiplying the force constant of the 
motor by input current: F = I x K f
Continuous torque, continuous force (Fc)
Or also nominal torque, nominal force. This is the torque 
or force, that rotary or linear motors can produce in continuous operation when continuous current of 100% load 
rate(duty cycle) is applied to the motor coil.
Continuous current (I c)
It is a current that flows over longer time into motor. 
The maximum allowed current into each coil is also called nominal current. It is characterized when the generated heat results in motor warming of up to 80 °C.  
It is the smallest distance, that the position measuring 
system will detect. The reachable step size is, in principle, larger than resolution due to other additional factors.
Eccentricity
This is the deviation of the center point of rotation of rotary tables from their position during rotation. It is created by centering and bearing tolerances.
1  Technical Information
Step size
Also called resolution. It is the smallest possible movement 
of a system. It depends on encoder, amplifier, mechanical 
construction, backlash, etc.
Accuracy
This, or actually the better terminology, the inaccuracy, 
corresponds to the deviation between target and actual 
position. The accuracy along an axis is defined as the remaining difference of target and actual position, after other 
linear deviations are excluded. Such systematic or linear 
deviations can be caused by  cosine error, angle deviation, 
ball screw error, thermal expansion, etc. For all target positions of interest in an application, it is calculated with the 
following formula:
Maximum of sum of systematic target-actual-difference 
+ 2 sigma (standard deviation)
Please do not confuse accuracy with repeatablity.
Attraction force (Fa)
This is created between the primary and secondary parts of 
the ironcore linear motors which must be taken up by the 
guide.
Winding resistance R25
This is the coil-specific dimension of is the winding 
resistance at 25°C. At 80°C, the winding resistance increases to approximately 1.2 x R25.
Winding temperature (T)
This is the permitted winding temperature. The actual 
motor temperature is dependent on the installation, cooling 
and operating conditions and consequently can only be 
determined in a concrete case and cannot be calculated.
Wobbling
It is a term for rotary motor. Wobble is the angular deviation 
of rotating axis from theoretical axis of rotation as the motor turns. The reason for it is possibly bearing tolerances.
Peak current (I p)
This current is applied to coils for a short time to generate 
peak force.The maximum time for applying peak current 
is 1 second. After that, motor has to cool down to nominal 
operating temperature, before further peak current could 
be applied again.
Peak torque, peak force (Fp)
The peak torque (for rotary motion) or peak force 
(for linear motion) is the maximum force that a motor can generate for approximately one second with 
peak current Ip. While applying Ip into motor, it is 
operating near the non-linear range of motor. This 
is especially useful for acceleration and braking.

Appendix A: Motor Sizing
Motion velocity profile
1.   1/3-1/3-1/3 trapezoid profile
If the distance (X) and move time (T) have been 
given, the most common and efficient velocity profile 
for point-to-point motion is the “1/3-1/3-1/3” 
trapezoid curve because it provides the optimal 
move by minimizing the power required to complete 
the move. It breaks the time of the acceleration, 
Strokeing, and deceleration into three segments as 
shown below. 
Herein the parameters are described as motion 
equation. 
2.   1/2-1/2 triangle profile
If X and T are given, another common motion profile is 
the 1/2-1/2 triangle profile. The motion is divided into 
two parts, namely 
acceleration and deceleration. The second motion velocity profile is shown as follows.
Start Motor Sizing
The following contents describe how to choose proper 
motor according to speed, moving distance, and Payloading 
inertia. The basic process for sizing a motor is:
	 Decide motion profile and required parameters
	 Calculate peak and continuous force
	 Select motor
Symbols
X   : move distance (mm)
T   : move time (sec)
a   : acceleration (mm/s2)
V   : velocity (mm/s)
ML: Payloading (kg)
g   : gravitation acceleration (mm/s2)
Fp : peak force (N)
Fc : continuous force (N)
Fa : attraction force between stator and forcer (applicable for 
LMS, LMF series) (N)
Fi  : inertia force (N)
Kp : force constant (N/Arms)
Ip   : peak current (Arms)
Ie   : effective current (Arms)
Ic   : continuous current (Arms)
V0 : starting velocity (mm/s)
STEP 1 Decide motion velocity profile and required 
parameters
In order to determine the correct motor for a particular 
application it is necessary to be familiar with the motion 
equation.
Motion equation
Basic kinematics equations are described as follows: 
Where V is velocity, a is acceleration, T is move time and X is  
move distance.
You can choose two of the four parameters (V, a, T and X) as 
your designed parameters, then the last two parameters can 
be calculated by above equations.

The peak current Ip and effective current Ie can be 
calculated by using motor force constant Kf.

STEP 3 Select motor by peak force and verify the 
current supply of motor 
From the HIWIN catalog, you can check the 
specifications of motor and choose an applicable 
motor by peak force, and then you can verify the 
current supply if it is fitted the specification as 
follows.  
Regarding effective and continuous current, the 
ratio of Ie/Ic had better be less than 0.7 to attain 
some margin.
The acceleration required in the first motion velocity profile is  
bigger than that in the second motion velocity profile; therefore, the required motor size is bigger. When choosing second 
motion velocity profile, the chosen motor size is smaller, however, we need to verify the DC bus of driver is bigger enough, 
due to the higher velocity (Vmax).     
STEP 2 Determine peak force and effective force 
The peak force can be calculated by the follow equation
Where Fi is inertia force while Ff is friction force, and μ is 
friction factor.
In most cases, motions are cyclic point-to-point 
movements. Assuming a cyclic motion shown in the 
following profile with a pause time of t4 second, the 
effective force can be calculated as following formula:

Linear Motor Sizing Example
For example, if Payload is 5 kg (moving mass of mechanism 
is 1 kg and payPayload is 4 kg), friction factor μ is 0.01 
,distance is 500 mm, move time is 400 ms and dwell time is 
350 ms. 
At first, we can calculate the Vmax, amax, Fp and Fe by the 
formulas described above (choose the first motion velocity 
profile and LMC series)
In this case, we can choose motor of type LMCA6 (p.48) which 
can provide up to 187(N )of peak force and continuous force 
62(N), and the force constant is 33.8 N/A(rms). Then the 
current supply of motor can be determined as follows

Appendix B: Sizing a Regen Resistor
1.  Gather required information
To calculate the power and resistance of the regen resistor 
requires information about the amplifier and the motor. 
For all applications, gather the following information:
	 Detail of motion profile, including acceleration and velocity
	 Amplifier model number
	 Applied line voltage to amplifier
	 Toque/force constant of the motor
	 Resistance (line-to-line) of the motor windings
For rotary motor applications, gather additional information
	 Payload inertia seen by the motor
	 Inertia of the motor
For linear motor applications, gather additional information
	 Moving mass
2.  Observe the properties of each deceleration during a complete cycle of operation
For each deceleration during the motion cycle, determine:
	 Speed at the start of the deceleration
	 Speed at the end of the deceleration
	 Time over which the deceleration takes place
3.  Calculate energy returned for each deceleration
The energy returned during each deceleration can be 
calculated by the following formulas.
Rotary motor:
Edec (joules): Energy returned by the deceleration
Jt (kg m2 ): Payload inertia on the motor shaft plus the motor inertia 
       (radians /sec): Shaft speed at the start of deceleration
       (radians /sec): Shaft speed at the end of deceleration
Ie   : effective current (Arms)
Linear motor:
Edec (joules): Energy returned by the deceleration
Mt (kg): Moving mass
V1 (meters /sec): Velocity at the start of deceleration
V2 (meters /sec): Velocity at the end of deceleration
4.  Determine the amount of energy dissipated by the motor
Calculate the amount of energy dissipated by the motor 
due to current flow through the motor winding resistance 
using the following formula.
Ppower (watts): Power dissipated in the motor
Rwinding (ohm): Line to Line resistance of the motor coil
F	: Force need to decelerate the motor
       Nm for rotary applications
       N for linear applications
Kt: Torque constant for the motor
      Nm/Amp for rotary applications
       N/Amp for linear applications
Emotor = Pmotor Tdecel
Emotor (joules): Energy dissipated in the motor
Tdecel (seconds): Time of deceleration
5.	 Determine the amount of energy returned to the 
amplifier
Calculate the amount of energy that will be returned to the 
amplifier for each deceleration using the following formula
Ereturned = Edec-Emotor
Ereturned (joules): Energy returned to the amplifier
Edec (joules): Energy returned by the deceleration
Emotor (joules): Energy dissipated by the motor
6.	 Determine if energy returned exceeds amplifier capacity
Compare the amount of energy returned to the amplifier 
in each deceleration with the amplifier’s absorption 
capacity. The following formula is used to determine the 
energy that can be absorbed by the amplifier.
Wcapacity (joules): The energy that can be absorbed by the bus capacitor
C (farads): Bus capacitance 
Vregen(volts): Voltage at which the regen circuit turns on
Vmains(volts): Mains voltage (AC) applied to the amplifier 
7.	 Calculated energy to be dissipated for each deceleration
For each deceleration where the energy exceeds the 
amplifier’s capacity, using the following formula to 
calculate the energy that must be dissipated by the regen 
resistor.
Eregen = Ereturned _ Eamp
Eregen (joules): Energy that must be dissipated in the regen resistor 
Ereturned (joules): Energy delivered back to the amplifier from the motor
Eamp (joules): Energy that the amplifier will absorb
8.	 Calculate pulse power of each deceleration that exceeds  
amplifier capacity
For each deceleration where energy must be dissipated by 
the regen resistor, use the following formula to calculate 
the pulse power that will be dissipated by the regen 
resistor
Ppulse = Eregen / Tdecel   
Ppulse (watts): Pulse power
Eregen (joules): Energy that must be dissipated in the regen resistor
Tdecel (seconds): Time of deceleration 
9.	 Calculate resistance needed to dissipate the pulse power 
 Using the maximum pulse power from the previous 
calculation, calculate the resistance value of the regen 
resistor required to dissipate the maximum pulse power.
R = V2regen / Ppulse max  
R(ohms):Resistance
Ppulse max:The maximum pulse power
Vregen :The voltage at which the regen circuit turns on 
Choose a standard value of resistance less than the 
calculated value. The value must also be greater than 
the minimum regen resistor value specified by the 
amplifier supplier.
10.  Regen resistor sizing example
Gather required information
LM ROBOTS type:LMXL1L-S37L-1200-G200
Amplifier: mega-fabs D1
   DC bus capacitance: 1880uF
   Regen circuit turn on voltage: 390V
   Minimum resistance:15Ω
Moving mass: 86Kg (include payPayload 74 Kg)
Vmax: 2 m/s
Acceleration, deceleration: 5 m/s2
Power supply (AC) of driver: 220VAC 
Motor type:LMS37L
Force constant (Kf): 68N/A(rms)
Rwinding: 2 ohms(line-to-line)

Calculate regen resistor as following step:

Because the total value of selected resistance must be 
less than 844.77 ohms and the power capacity must be 
more than 180.05 watts, we choose two resistors and 
connect them in series, in each resistor the resistance 
is 68 ohms and power capacity is 100W. The total 
resistance value is 136 ohms and power capacity is 
200W. The resistance order number is 050100700001.
