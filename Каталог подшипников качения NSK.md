We want to thank you for your interest in this edition of our Rolling Bearing Catalog.
It has been revised with our customers in mind, and we hope it fills your needs.
Recently, technology has been advancing at a remarkable pace, and with it has come
a host of new products in many fields including computers, office automation,
audio-visual equipment, medical equipment, and many others. These striking
innovations present a challenge to bearing manufacturers since there are ever
increasing demand to offer bearings with higher performance, accuracy, and
reliability. Manufacturers of diverse equipment have many different bearing
requirements including higher speeds, less torque, less noise and vibration, zero
maintenance, survival in harsh environments, integration into units, and many more.
This catalog was revised to reflect the growing number of NSK products and certain
revisions in JIS and ISO and to better serve our customers. The first part contains
general information about rolling bearings to facilitate selection of the most
appropriate type. Next supplementary technical information is provided regarding
bearing life, load ratings, limiting speeds, handling and mounting, lubrication, etc.
Finally, the catalog presents extensive tables containing most bearing numbers and
showing dimensions and pertinent design data listed in the order of increasing bore
size. Data in the table are given in both the international Unit System (SI) and
Engineering Unit System (Gravitational System of Units).
We hope this catalog will allow you to select the optimum bearing for your
application. However, if assistance is required, please contact NSK, and the
company’s engineers and computer programs can quickly supply the information
you need.

1.1 Design and Classification
Rolling bearings generally consist of two rings, rolling
elements, and a cage, and they are classified into radial
bearings or thrust bearings depending on the direction
of the main load. In addition, depending on the type of
rolling elements, they are classified into ball bearings
or roller bearings, and they are further segregated by
differences in their design or specific purpose.
The most common bearing types and nomenclature of
bearing parts are shown in Fig.1.1, and a general
classification of rolling bearings is shown in Fig. 1.2.
1.2 Characteristics of Rolling Bearings
Compared with plain bearings, rolling bearings have
the following major advantages:
(1) Their starting torque or friction is low and the
difference between the starting torque and running
torque is small.
(2) With 	the 	advancement 	of 	worldwide
standardization, rolling bearings are internationally
available and interchangeable.
(3) Maintenance, replacement, and inspection are easy
because the structure surrounding rolling bearings
is simple.
(4) Many rolling bearings are capable of taking both
radial and axial loads simultaneously or
independently.
(5) Rolling bearings can be used under a wide range of
temperatures.
(6) Rolling bearings can be preloaded to produce a
negative clearance and achieve greater rigidity.
Furthermore, different types of rolling bearings have
their own individual advantages. The features of the
most common rolling bearings are described on Pages
A10 to A12 and in Table 1.1 (Pages A14 and A15).

TYPES AND FEATURES OF ROLLING BEARINGS
Single-row deep groove ball bearings are the most common type of rolling bearings. Their use is
very widespread. The raceway grooves on both the inner and outer rings have circular arcs of
slightly larger radius than that of the balls. In addition to radial loads, axial loads can be imposed in
either direction. Because of their low torque, they are highly suitable for applications where high
speeds and low power loss are required.
In addition to open type bearings, these bearings often have steel shields or rubber seals installed
on one or both sides and are prelubricated with grease. Also, snap rings are sometimes used on
the periphery. As to cages, pressed steel ones are the most common.
Single-Row
Deep Groove
Ball Bearings
The inner groove of magneto bearings is a little shallower than that of deep groove bearings. Since
the outer ring has a shoulder on only one side, the outer ring may be removed. This is often
advantageous for mounting. In general, two such bearings are used in duplex pairs. Magneto
bearings are small bearings with a bore diameter of 4 to 20 mm and are mainly used for small
magnetos, gyroscopes, instruments, etc. Pressed brass cages are generally used.
Magneto
Bearings
Individual bearings of this type are capable of taking radial loads and also axial loads in one
direction. Four contact angles of 15°, 25°, 30°, and 40° are available. The larger the contact angle,
the higher the axial load capacity. For high speed operation, however, the smaller contact angles
are preferred. Usually, two bearings are used in duplex pairs, and the clearance between them
must be adjusted properly.
Pressed-steel cages are commonly used, however, for high precision bearings with a contact angle
less than 30°, polyamide resin cages are often used.
Single-Row
Angular Contact
Ball Bearings
A combination of two radial bearings is called a duplex pair. Usually, they are formed using angular
contact ball bearings or tapered roller bearings. Possible combinations include face-to-face, which
have the outer ring faces together (type DF), back-to-back (type DB), or both front faces in the
same direction (type DT). DF and DB duplex bearings are capable of taking radial loads and axial
loads in either direction. Type DT is used when there is a strong axial load in one direction and it is
necessary to impose the load equally on each bearing.
Duplex Bearings
Double-row angular contact ball bearings are basically two single-row angular contact ball
bearings mounted back-to-back except that they have only one inner ring and one outer ring, each
having raceways. They can take axial loads in either direction.
Double-Row
Angular Contact
Ball Bearings
The inner and outer rings of four-point contact ball bearings are separable because the inner ring
is split in a radial plane. They can take axial loads from either direction. The balls have a contact
angle of 35° with each ring. Just one bearing of this type can replace a combination of face-to-face
or back-to-back angular contact bearings.
Machined brass cages are generally used.
Four-Point
Contact
Ball Bearings
The inner ring of this type of bearing has two raceways and the outer ring has a single spherical
raceway with its center of curvature coincident with the bearing axis. Therefore, the axis of the
inner ring, balls, and cage can deflect to some extent around the bearing center. Consequently,
minor angular misalignment of the shaft and housing caused by machining or mounting error is
automatically corrected.
This type of bearing often has a tapered bore for mounting using an adapter sleeve.
Self-Aligning
Ball Bearings
In bearings of this type, the cylindrical rollers are in linear contact with the raceways. They have a
high radial load capacity and are suitable for high speeds.
There are different types designated NU, NJ, NUP, N, NF for single-row bearings, and NNU, NN for
double-row bearings depending on the design or absence of side ribs.
The outer and inner rings of all types are separable.
Some cylindrical roller bearings have no ribs on either the inner or outer ring, so the rings can
move axially relative to each other. These can be used as free-end bearings. Cylindrical roller
bearings, in which either the inner or outer rings has two ribs and the other ring has one, are
capable of taking some axial load in one direction. Double-row cylindrical roller bearings have high
radial rigidity and are used primarily for precision machine tools.
Pressed steel or machined brass cages are generally used, but sometimes molded polyamide
cages are also used.

TYPES AND FEATURES OF ROLLING BEARINGS
Needle roller bearings contain many slender rollers with a length 3 to 10 times their diameter. As a
result, the ratio of the bearing outside diameter to the inscribed circle diameter is small, and they
have a rather high radial load capacity.
There are numerous types available, and many have no inner rings. The drawn-cup type has a
pressed steel outer ring and the solid type has a machined outer ring. There are also cage and
roller assemblies without rings. Most bearings have pressed steel cages, but some are without
cages.
Needle
Roller Bearings
Bearings of this type use conical rollers guided by a back-face rib on the cone. These bearings are
capable of taking high radial loads and also axial loads in one direction. In the HR series, the
rollers are increased in both size and number giving it an even higher load capacity.
They are generally mounted in pairs in a manner similar to single-row angular contact ball
bearings. In this case, the proper internal clearance can be obtained by adjusting the axial distance
between the cones or cups of the two opposed bearings. Since they are separable, the cone
assemblies and cups can be mounted independently.
Depending upon the contact angle, tapered roller bearings are divided into three types called the
normal angle, medium angle, and steep angle. Double-row and four-row tapered roller bearings
are also available. Pressed steel cages are generally used.
Tapered
Roller Bearings
These bearings have barrel-shaped rollers between the inner ring, which has two raceways, and
the outer ring which has one spherical raceway. Since the center of curvature of the outer ring
raceway surface coincides with the bearing axis, they are self-aligning in a manner similar to that
of self-aligning ball bearings. Therefore, if there is deflection of the shaft or housing or
misalignment of their axes, it is automatically corrected so excessive force is not applied to the
bearings.
Spherical roller bearings can take, not only heavy radial loads, but also some axial loads in either
direction. They have excellent radial load-carrying capacity and are suitable for use where there are
heavy or impact loads.
Some bearings have tapered bores and may be mounted directly on tapered shafts or cylindrical
shafts using adapters or withdrawal sleeves.
Pressed steel and machined brass cages are used.
Spherical
Roller Bearings
Single-direction thrust ball bearings are composed of washer-like bearing rings with raceway
grooves. The ring attached to the shaft is called the shaft washer (or inner ring) while that attached
to the housing is called the housing washer(or outer ring).
In double-direction thrust ball bearings, there are three rings with the middle one (center ring)
being fixed to the shaft.
There are also thrust ball bearings with an aligning seat washer beneath the housing washer in
order to compensate for shaft misalignment or mounting error.
Pressed steel cages are usually used in the smaller bearings and machined cages in the larger
Single-Direction
Thrust Ball
Bearings
Double-Direction
Thrust Ball
Bearings
These bearings have a spherical raceway in the housing washer and barrel-shaped rollers obliquely
arranged around it. Since the raceway in the housing washer in spherical, these bearings are self-
aligning. They have a very high axial load capacity and are capable of taking moderate radial loads
when an axial load is applied.
Pressed steel cages or machined brass cages are usually used.

The number of applications for rolling bearings is
almost countless and the operating conditions and
environments also vary greatly. In addition, the
diversity of operating conditions and bearing
requirements continue to grow with the rapid
advancement of technology. Therefore, it is necessary
to study bearings carefully from many angles to select
the best one from the thousands of types and sizes
available.
Usually, a bearing type is provisionally chosen
considering the operating conditions, mounting
arrangement, ease of mounting in the machine,
allowable space, cost, availability, and other factors.
Then the size of the bearing is chosen to satisfy the
desired life requirement. When doing this, in addition
to fatigue life, it is necessary to consider grease life,
noise and vibration, wear, and other factors.
There is no fixed procedure for selecting bearings. It is
good to investigate experience with similar
applications and studies relevant to any special
requirements for your specific application. When
selecting bearings for new machines, unusual
operating conditions, or harsh environments, please
consult with NSK.
The following diagram (Fig.2.1) shows an example of
the bearing selection procedure.

A 19	A 18
3.1 Allowable Bearing Space
The allowable space for a rolling bearing and its
adjacent parts is generally limited so the type and size
of the bearing must be selected within such limits. In
most cases, the shaft diameter is fixed first by the
machine design; therefore, the bearing is often
selected based on its bore size. For rolling bearings,
there are numerous standardized dimension series and
types, and the selection of the optimum bearing from
among them is necessary. Fig. 3.1 shows the
dimension series of radial bearings and corresponding
bearing types.
3.2 Load Capacity and Bearing Types
The axial load carrying capacity of a bearing is closely
related to the radial load capacity (see Page A24) in a
manner that depends on the bearing design as shown
in Fig. 3.2. This figure makes it clear that when
bearings of the same dimension series are compared,
roller bearings have a higher load capacity than ball
bearings and are superior if shock loads exist.
3.3 Permissible Speed and Bearing Types
The maximum speed of rolling bearings varies
depending, not only the type of bearing, but also its
size, type of cage, loads, lubricating method, heat
dissipation, etc. Assuming the common oil bath
lubrication method, the bearing types are roughly
ranked from higher speed to lower as shown in Fig.
3.3.
3.4 Misalignment of Inner/Outer Rings and
Bearing Types
Because of deflection of a shaft caused by applied
loads, dimensional error of the shaft and housing, and
mounting errors, the inner and outer rings are slightly
misaligned. The permissible misalignment varies
depending on the bearing type and operating
conditions, but usually it is a small angle less than
0.0012 radian (4').
When a large misalignment is expected, bearings
having a self-aligning capability, such as self-aligning
ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, and certain
bearing units should be selected (Figs. 3.4 and 3.5).
3. SELECTION OF BEARING TYPES
Permissible bearing misalignment is given at the
beginning of the dimensional tables for each bearing
type.
3.5 Rigidity and Bearing Types
When loads are imposed on a rolling bearing, some
elastic deformation occurs in the contact areas
between the rolling elements and raceways. The
rigidity of the bearing is determined by the ratio of
bearing load to the amount of elastic deformation of
the inner and outer rings and rolling elements. For the
main spindles of machine tools, it is necessary to have
high rigidity of the bearings together with the rest of
the spindle. Consequently, since roller bearings are
deformed less by load, they are more often selected
than ball bearings. When extra high rigidity is required,
bearings are given a preload, which means that they
have a negative clearance. Angular contract ball
bearings and tapered roller bearings are often
preloaded.
3.6 Noise and Torque of Various Bearing
Types
Since rolling bearings are manufactured with very high
precision, noise and torque are minimal. For deep
groove ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings
particularly, the noise level is sometimes specified
depending on their purpose. For high precision
miniature ball bearings, the starting torque is specified.
Deep groove ball bearings are recommended for
applications in which low noise and torque are
required, such as motors and instruments.
3.7 Running Accuracy and Bearing Types
For the main spindles of machine tools that require
high running accuracy or high speed applications like
superchargers, high precision bearings of Class 5, 4 or
2 are usually used.
The running accuracy of rolling bearings is specified in
various ways, and the specified accuracy classes vary
depending on the bearing type. A comparison of the
inner ring radial runout for the highest running
accuracy specified for each bearing type is shown in
Fig. 3.6.
For applications requiring high running accuracy, deep
groove ball bearings, angular contact ball bearings,
and cylindrical roller bearings are most suitable.
3.8 Mounting and Dismounting of Various
Bearing Types
Separable types of bearings like cylindrical roller
bearings, needle roller bearings and tapered roller
bearings are convenient for mounting and
dismounting. For machines in which bearings are
mounted and dismounted rather often for periodic
inspection, these types of bearings are recommended.
Also, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical roller
bearings (small ones) with tapered bores can be
mounted and dismounted relatively easily using
sleeves.

In general, shafts are supported by only two bearings.
When considering the bearing mounting arrangement,
the following items must be investigated:
(1) Expansion and contraction of the shaft caused by
temperature variations.
(2) Ease of bearing mounting and dismounting.
(3) Misalignment of the inner and outer rings caused
by deflection of the shaft or mounting error.
(4) Rigidity of the entire system including bearings and
preloading method.
(5) Capability to sustain the loads at their proper
positions and to transmit them.
4.1 Fixed-End and Free-End Bearings
Among the bearings on a shaft, only one can be a
"fixed-end" bearing that is used to fix the shaft axially.
For this fixed-end bearing, a type which can carry both
radial and axial loads must be selected.
Bearings other than the fixed-end one must be "free-
end" bearings that carry only radial loads to relieve the
shaft's thermal elongation and contraction.
If measures to relieve a shaft’s thermal elongation and
contraction are insufficient, abnormal axial loads are
applied to the bearings, which can cause premature
failure.
For free-end bearings, cylindrical roller bearings or
needle roller bearings with separable inner and outer
rings that are free to move axially (NU, N types, etc.)
are recommended. When these types are used,
mounting and dismounting are also easier.
When non-separable types are used as free-end
bearings, usually the fit between the outer ring and
housing is loose to allow axial movement of the
running shaft together with the bearing. Sometimes,
such elongation is relieved by a loose fitting between
the inner ring and shaft.
When the distance between the bearings is short and
the influence of the shaft elongation and contraction is
negligible, two opposed angular contact ball bearings
or tapered roller bearings are used. The axial clearance
(possible axial movement) after the mounting is
adjusted using nuts or shims.
4. SELECTION OF BEARING ARRANGEMENT
The distinction between free-end and fixed-end
bearings and some possible bearing mounting
arrangements for various bearing types are shown in
Fig. 4.1.

By designating the basic rating life as Lh (h), bearing
speed as n (min–1), fatigue life factor as fh, and speed
factor as fn, the relations shown in Table 5.2 are
obtained:
on which the bearings are to be mounted should also
be considered. Bearings are used in a wide range of
applications and the design life varies with specific
applications and operating conditions. Table 5.1 gives
an empirical fatigue life factor derived from customary
operating experience for various machines. Also refer
to Table 5.2.
5.2.3 Selection of Bearing Size Based on Basic Load
Rating
The following relation exists between bearing load and
basic rating life:
For ball bearings 	L = ( 	) 3
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.1)
For roller bearings L = ( 	) 	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.2)
where 	L : Basic rating life (106 rev)
P : Bearing load (equivalent load) (N), {kgf}
..........(Refer to Page A30)
C : Basic load rating (N), {kgf}
For radial bearings, C is written Cr
For thrust bearings, C is written Ca
In the case of bearings that run at a constant speed, it
is convenient to express the fatigue life in terms of
hours. In general, the fatigue life of bearings used in
automobiles and other vehicles is given in terms of
mileage.

5.1 Bearing Life
The various functions required of rolling bearings vary
according to the bearing application. These functions
must be performed for a prolonged period. Even if
bearings are properly mounted and correctly operated,
they will eventually fail to perform satisfactorily due to
an increase in noise and vibration, loss of running
accuracy, deterioration of grease, or fatigue flaking of
the rolling surfaces.
Bearing life, in the broad sense of the term, is the
period during which bearings continue to operate and
to satisfy their required functions. This bearing life may
be defined as noise life, abrasion life, grease life, or
rolling fatigue life, depending on which one causes
loss of bearing service.
Aside from the failure of bearings to function due to
natural deterioration, bearings may fail when
conditions such as heat-seizure, fracture, scoring of
the rings, damage of the seals or the cage, or other
damage occurs.
Conditions such as these should not be interpreted as
normal bearing failure since they often occur as a
result of errors in bearing selection, improper design
or manufacture of the bearing surroundings, incorrect
mounting, or insufficient maintenance.
5.1.1 Rolling Fatigue Life and Basic Rating Life
When rolling bearings are operated under load, the
raceways of their inner and outer rings and rolling
elements are subjected to repeated cyclic stress.
Because of metal fatigue of the rolling contact surfaces
of the raceways and rolling elements, scaly particles
may separate from the bearing material (Fig. 5.1). This
phenomenon is called "flaking". Rolling fatigue life is
represented by the total number of revolutions at
which time the bearing surface will start flaking due to
stress. This is called fatigue life. As shown in Fig. 5.2,
even for seemingly identical bearings, which are of the
same type, size, and material and receive the same
heat treatment and other processing, the rolling fatigue
life varies greatly even under identical operating
conditions. This is because the flaking of materials due
to fatigue is subject to many other variables.
Consequently, "basic rating life", in which rolling
fatigue life is treated as a statistical phenomenon, is
used in preference to actual rolling fatigue life.
Suppose a number of bearings of the same type are
operated individually under the same conditions. After
a certain period of time, 10% of them fail as a result of
flaking caused by rolling fatigue. The total number of
revolutions at this point is defined as the basic rating
life or, if the speed is constant, the basic rating life is
often expressed by the total number of operating hours
completed when 10% of the bearings become
inoperable due to flaking.
In determining bearing life, basic rating life is often the
only factor considered. However, other factors must
also be taken into account. For example, the grease life
of grease-prelubricated bearings (refer to Section 12,
Lubrication, Page A107) can be estimated. Since noise
life and abrasion life are judged according to individual
standards for different applications, specific values for
noise or abrasion life must be determined empirically.
5.2 Basic Load Rating and Fatigue Life
5.2.1 Basic Load Rating
The basic load rating is defined as the constant load
applied on bearings with stationary outer rings that the
inner rings can endure for a rating life of one million
revolutions (10 6 rev). The basic load rating of radial
bearings is defined as a central radial load of constant
direction and magnitude, while the basic load rating of
thrust bearings is defined as an axial load of constant
magnitude in the same direction as the central axis.
The load ratings are listed under C r for radial bearings
and C a for thrust bearings in the dimension tables.
5.2.2 Machinery in which Bearings are Used and
Projected Life
It is not advisable to select bearings with unnecessarily
high load ratings, for such bearings may be too large
and uneconomical. In addition, the bearing life alone
should not be the deciding factor in the selection of
bearings. The strength, rigidity, and design of the shaft

If the bearing load P and speed n are
known, determine a fatigue life factor fh
appropriate for the projected life of the
machine and then calculate the basic load
rating C by means of the following
equation.
C = 	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.3)
A bearing which satisfies this value of
C should then be selected from the bearing
tables.
5.2.4 Temperature Adjustment for Basic
Load Rating
If rolling bearings are used at high
temperature, the hardness of the bearing
steel decreases. Consequently, the basic
load rating, which depends on the physical
properties of the material, also decreases.
Therefore, the basic load rating should be
adjusted for the higher temperature using
the following equation:
Ct = f t ⋅ C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.4)
where 	Ct : Basic load rating after
temperature correction
(N), {kgf}
f t : Temperature factor
(See Table 5.3.)
C : Basic load rating before
temperature adjustment
(N), {kgf}
If large bearings are used at higher than
120o C, they must be given special
dimensional stability heat treatment to
prevent excessive dimensional changes.
The basic load rating of bearings given such
special dimensional stability heat treatment
may become lower than the basic load
rating listed in the bearing tables.

5.2.5 Correction of Basic Rating Life
As described previously, the basic equations for
calculating the basic rating life are as follows:
For ball bearings 	L10 = ( 	) 3
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.5)
For roller bearings L10 = ( 	) 	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.6)
The L10 life is defined as the basic rating life with a
statistical reliability of 90%. Depending on the
machines in which the bearings are used, sometimes a
reliability higher than 90% may be required. However,
recent improvements in bearing material have greatly
extended the fatigue life. In addition, the developent of
the Elasto-Hydrodynamic Theory of Lubrication proves
that the thickness of the lubricating film in the contact
zone between rings and rolling elements greatly
influences bearing life. To reflect such improvements
in the calculation of fatigue life, the basic rating life is
adjusted using the following adjustment factors:
Lna = a1 a2 a3 L10 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.7)
where 	Lna : Adjusted rating life in which reliability,
material improvements, lubricating
conditions, etc. are considered
L10 : Basic rating life with a reliability of 90%
a1 : Life adjustment factor for reliability
a2 : Life adjustment factor for special bearing
properties
a3 : Life adjustment factor for operating
conditions
The life adjustment factor for reliability, a1, is listed in
Table 5.4 for reliabilities higher than 90%.
The life adjustment factor for special bearing
properties, a2, is used to reflect improvements in
bearing steel.
NSK now uses vacuum degassed bearing steel, and
the results of tests by NSK show that life is greatly
improved when compared with earlier materials. The
basic load ratings Cr and Ca listed in the bearing tables
were calculated considering the extended life achieved
by improvements in materials and manufacturing
techniques. Consequently, when estimating life using
Equation (5.7), it is sufficient to assume that is greater
than one.

The life adjustment factor for operating conditions a3
is used to adjust for various factors, particularly
lubrication. If there is no misalignment between the
inner and outer rings and the thickness of the
lubricating film in the contact zones of the bearing is
sufficient, it is possible for a3 to be greater than one;
however, a3 is less than one in the following cases:
• When the viscosity of the lubricant in the contact
zones between the raceways and rolling
elements is low.
• When the circumferential speed of the rolling
elements is very slow.
• When the bearing temperature is high.
• When the lubricant is contaminated by water or
foreign matter.
• When misalignment of the inner and outer rings
is excessive.
It is difficult to determine the proper value for a3 for
specific operating conditions because there are still
many unknowns. Since the special bearing property
factor a2 is also influenced by the operating conditions,
there is a proposal to combine a2 and a3 into one
quantity(a2×a3), and not consider them independently.
In this case, under normal lubricating and operating
conditions, the product (a2 ×a3) should be assumed
equal to one. However, if the viscosity of the lubricant
is too low, the value drops to as low as 0.2.
If there is no misalignment and a lubricant with high
viscosity is used so sufficient fluid-film thickness is
secured, the product of (a2×a3) may be about two.
When selecting a bearing based on the basic load
rating, it is best to choose an a1 reliability factor
appropriate for the projected use and an empirically
determined C/P or fh value derived from past results
for lubrication, temperature, mounting conditions, etc.
in similar machines.
The basic rating life equations (5.1), (5.2), (5.5), and
(5.6) give satisfactory results for a broad range of
bearing loads. However, extra heavy loads may cause
detrimental plastic deformation at ball/raceway contact
points. When Pr exceeds C 0 r (Basic static load rating)
or 0.5 Cr, whichever is smaller, for radial bearings or
Pa exceeds 0.5 Ca for thrust bearings, please consult
NSK to establish the applicablity of the rating fatigue
life equations.

5.3.3 Bearing Loads in Gear Transmission
Applications
The loads imposed on gears in gear transmissions
vary according to the type of gears used. In the
simplest case of spur gears, the load is calculated as
follows:
M = 9 550 000H / n ....( N ⋅ m m ) }...........(5.12)
= 0 974 000H / n ....{kgf⋅mm}
Pk = M / r .............................................(5.13)
Sk = Pk tan
θ ...........................................(5.14)
Kc = √

Pk
2+Sk
2 = Pk sec
θ .........................(5.15)
where 	M : Torque applied to gear
(N . mm),{kgf . mm}
Pk : Tangential force on gear (N), {kgf}
Sk : Radial force on gear (N), {kgf}
Kc : Combined force imposed on gear
(N), {kgf}
H : Power transmitted (kW)
n : Speed (min–1)
r : Pitch circle radius of drive gear (mm)
θ : Pressure angle
In addition to the theoretical load calculated above,
vibration and shock (which depend on how accurately
the gear is finished) should be included using the gear
factor fg by multiplying the theoretically calculated load
by this factor.
The values of fg should generally be those in Table 5.7.
When vibration from other sources accompanies gear
operation, the actual load is obtained by multiplying
the load factor by this gear factor.
5.3.4 Load Distribution on Bearings
In the simple examples shown in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6. The
radial loads on bearings1and 2 can be calculated
using the following equations:
FC1= 	K ...............................................(5.16)
FC2= 	K ..............................................(5.17)
where 	FC1: Radial load applied on bearing1
(N), {kgf}
FC2 : Radial load applied on bearing2
(N), {kgf}
K : Shaft load (N), {kgf}
When these loads are applied simultaneously, first the
radial load for each should be obtained, and then, the
sum of the vectors may be calculated according to the
load direction.
5.3.5 Average of Fluctuating Load
When the load applied on bearings fluctuates, an
average load which will yield the same bearing life as
the fluctuating load should be calculated.
(1) When the relation between load and rotating speed
is divided into the following steps (Fig. 5.7)
Load F1 : Speed n1 ; Operating time t1
Load F2 : Speed n2 ; Operating time t2
Load Fn : Speed nn ; Operating time tn
Then, the average load Fm may be calculated using the
following equation:
Fm = p
√ 
..........................(5.18)

5.3 Calculation of Bearing Loads
The loads applied on bearings generally include the
weight of the body to be supported by the bearings,
the weight of the revolving elements themselves, the
transmission power of gears and belting, the load
produced by the operation of the machine in which the
bearings are used, etc. These loads can be theoretically
calculated, but some of them are difficult to estimate.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to correct the
estimated using empirically derived data.
5.3.1 Load Factor
When a radial or axial load has been mathematically
calculated, the actual load on the bearing may be
greater than the calculated load because of vibration
and shock present during operation of the machine.
The actual load may be calculated using the following
equation:
Fr = fw ⋅ Frc } . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5.8)
Fa = fw ⋅ Fac
where Fr, Fa : Loads applied on bearing (N), {kgf}
Frc, Fac : Theoretically calculated load (N) ,
{kgf}
fw : Load factor
The values given in Table 5.5 are usually used for the
load factor fw.
5.3.2 Bearing Loads in Belt or Chain Transmission
Applications
The force acting on the pulley or sprocket wheel when
power is transmitted by a belt or chain is calculated
using the following equations.
M = 9 550 000H / n ....( N ⋅ m m ) }.............(5.9)
= 0 974 000H / n ....{kgf⋅mm}
Pk = M / r .............................................(5.10)
where 	M : Torque acting on pulley or sprocket
wheel (N⋅mm), {kgf⋅ mm}
Pk : Effective force transmitted by belt or
chain (N), {kgf}
H : Power transmitted(kW)
n : Speed (min–1)
r : Effective radius of pulley or sprocket
wheel (mm)
When calculating the load on a pulley shaft, the belt
tension must be included. Thus, to calculate the actual
load Kb in the case of a belt transmission, the effective
transmitting power is multiplied by the belt factor fb,
which represents the belt tension. The values of the
belt factor fb for different types of belts are shown in
Table 5.6.
Kb = fb ⋅ Pk .........................................(5.11)
In the case of a chain transmission, the values
corresponding to fb should be 1.25 to 1.5.

5.4.1 Calculation of Equivalent Loads
The equivalent load on radial bearings may be
calculated using the following equation:
P = XFr + YFa ........................................(5.25)
where 	P : Equivalent Load (N), {kgf}
Fr : Radial load (N), {kgf}
Fa : Axial load (N), {kgf}
X : Radial load factor
Y : Axial load factor
The values of X and Y are listed in the bearing tables.
The equivalent radial load for radial roller bearings with
α = 0° is
P = Fr
In general, thrust ball bearings cannot take radial
loads, but spherical thrust roller bearings can take
some radial loads. In this case, the equivalent load may
be calculated using the following equation:
P = Fa + 1.2Fr ..................................(5.26)
where 	≤0.55
5.4.2 Axial Load Components in Angular Contact
Ball Bearings and Tapered Roller Bearings
The effective load center of both angular contact ball
bearings and tapered roller bearings is at the point of
intersection of the shaft center line and a line
representing the load applied on the rolling element by
the outer ring as shown in Fig. 5.11. This effective load
Fr
Fa
center for each bearing is listed in the bearing tables.
When radial loads are applied to these types of
bearings, a component of load is produced in the axial
direction. In order to balance this component load,
bearings of the same type are used in pairs, placed
face to face or back to back. These axial loads can be
calculated using the following equation:
Fa i = 	Fr ...................................(5.27)
where 	Fa i : Component load in the axial direction
(N), {kgf}
Fr : Radial load (N), {kgf}
Y : Axial load factor
Assume that radial loads Fr1 and Fr2 are applied on
bearings1 and 2(Fig. 5.12) respectively, and an
external axial load Fae is applied as shown. If the axial
load factors are Y1, Y2 and the radial load factor is X,
then the equivalent loads P1 , P2 may be calculated as
follows:
where 	Fae + 	Fr2≥ 	Fr1
P1 = XFr1 + Y1 (Fae + 	Fr2) } ..............(5.28)
P2 = Fr2
where 	Fae + 	Fr2< 	Fr1

5.4 Equivalent Load
In some cases, the loads applied on bearings are
purely radial or axial loads; however, in most cases,
the loads are a combination of both. In addition, such
loads usually fluctuate in both magnitude and
direction. In such cases, the loads actually applied on
bearings cannot be used for bearing life calculations;
therefore, a hypothetical load that has a constant
magnitude and passes through the center of the
bearing, and will give the same bearing life that the
bearing would attain under actual conditions of load
and rotation should be estimated. Such a hypothetical
load is called the equivalent load.

5.6 Maximum Permissible Axial Loads for
Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings having inner and outer rings
with ribs, loose ribs or thrust collars are capable of
sustaining radial loads and limited axial loads
simultaneously. The maximum permissible axial load is
limited by an abnormal temperature rise or heat
seizure due to sliding friction between the end faces of
the rollers and rib face.
The maximum permissible axial load for bearings of
diameter series 3 that are continuously loaded and
lubricated with grease or oil is shown in Fig. 5.13.
Grease lubrication (Empirical equation)
CA = 9.8f { 	− 0.023 × (k⋅d)2.5}...(N)

In addition, for cylindrical roller bearings to have a
stable axial-load carrying capacity, the following
precautions are required for the bearings and their
surroundings:
• When axial loads are applied, radial loads must
also be applied.
• Sufficient lubricant must exist between the
roller end faces and ribs.
• Superior extreme-pressure grease must be used.
• Sufficient running-in should be done.
• The mounting accuracy must be good.
• The radial clearance should not be more than
necessary.
In cases where the bearing speed is extremely slow, the
speed exceeds the limiting speed by more than 50%, or
the bore diameter is more than 200mm, careful study
is necessary for each case regarding lubrication,
cooling, etc. In such a case, please consult with NSK.

SELECTION OF BEARING SIZE
5.5 Static Load Ratings and Static Equivalent
Loads
5.5.1 Static Load Ratings
When subjected to an excessive load or a strong shock
load, rolling bearings may incur a local permanent
deformation of the rolling elements and permanent
deformation of the rolling elements and raceway
surface if the elastic limit is exceeded. The nonelastic
deformation increases in area and depth as the load
increases, and when the load exceeds a certain limit,
the smooth running of the bearing is impeded.
The basic static load rating is defined as that static
load which produces the following calculated contact
stress at the center of the contact area between the
rolling element subjected to the maximum stress and
the raceway surface.
For self-aligning ball bearings 4 600MPa
{469kgf/mm2}
For other ball bearings 	4 200MPa
{428kgf/mm2}
For roller bearings 	4 000MPa
{408kgf/mm2}
In this most heavily stressed contact area, the sum of
the permanent deformation of the rolling element and
that of the raceway is nearly 0.0001 times the rolling
element's diameter. The basic static load rating Co is
written Cor for radial bearings and Coa for thrust
bearings in the bearing tables.
In addition, following the modification of the criteria
for basic static load rating by ISO, the new Co values
for NSK's ball bearings became about 0.8 to 1.3 times
the past values and those for roller bearings about 1.5
to 1.9 times. Consequently, the values of permissible
static load factor fs have also changed, so please pay
attention to this.
5.5.2 Static Equivalent Loads
The static equivalent load is a hypothetical load that
produces a contact stress equal to the above
maximum stress under actual conditions, while the
bearing is stationary (including very slow rotation or
oscillation), in the area of contact between the most
heavily stressed rolling element and bearing raceway.
The static radial load passing through the bearing
center is taken as the static equivalent load for radial
bearings, while the static axial load in the direction
coinciding with the central axis is taken as the static
equivalent load for thrust bearings.
(a) Static equivalent load on radial bearings
The greater of the two values calculated from the
following equations should be adopted as the static
equivalent load on radial bearings.
Po = Xo Fr + Yo Fa ...................................(5.30)
Po = Fr ..................................................(5.31)
where 	Po : Static equivalent load (N), {kgf}
Fr : Radial load (N), {kgf}
Fa : Axial load (N), {kgf}
Xo : Static radial load factor
Yo : Static axial load factor
(b)Static equivalent load on thrust bearings
Po = Xo Fr + Fa	
α =/ 90° .......................(5.32)
where 	Po : Static equivalent load (N), {kgf}
α : Contact angle
When Fa<Xo Fr , this equation becomes less accurate.
The values of Xo and Yo for Equations (5.30) and
(5.32) are listed in the bearing tables.
The static equivalent load for thrust roller bearings
with
α = 90° is Po = Fa
5.5.3 Permissible Static Load Factor
The permissible static equivalent load on bearings
varies depending on the basic static load rating and
also their application and operating conditions.
The permissible static load factor fs is a safety factor
that is applied to the basic static load rating, and it is
defined by the ratio in Equation (5.33). The generally
recommended values of fs are listed in Table 5.8.
Conforming to the modification of the static load
rating, the values of fs were revised, especially for
bearings for which the values of Co were increased,
please keep this in mind when selecting bearings.
fs = 	...............................................(5.33)
where 	Co : Basic static load rating (N), {kgf}
Po : Static equivalent load (N), {kgf}
For spherical thrust roller bearings, the values of fs
should be greater than 4.

The dynamic equivalent load P of spherical roller
bearings is given by:
when Fa / Fr≤e
P = XFr + YXa = Fr + Y3 Fa
when Fa / Fr>e
P = XFr + YFa = 0.67 Fr + Y2 Fa
Fa / Fr = 8 000/45 000 = 0.18
We can see in the bearing table that the value of e is
about 0.3 and that of Y3 is about 2.2 for bearings of
series 231:
Therefore, P = XFr + YFa = Fr + Y3 Fa
= 45 000 + 2.2 × 8 000
= 62 600N, {6 380kgf}
From the fatigue life factor fh, the basic load rating can
be obtained as follows:
fh = fn 	= 0.444 × 	≥3.45
consequently, Cr≥490 000N, {50 000kgf}
Among spherical roller bearings of series 231
satisfying this value of Cr, the smallest is 23126CE4
(Cr = 505 000N, {51 500kgf})
Once the bearing is determined, substitude the value of
Y3 in the equation and obtain the value of P.
P = Fr + Y3 Fa = 45 000 + 2.4 × 8 000
= 64 200N, {6 550kgf}
Lh = 500 ( fn 	)
= 500 (0.444 × 	)

To distribute the radial load Fr on bearings1and2, the
effective load centers must be located for tapered roller
bearings. Obtain the effective load center a for bearings
1and 2 from the bearing table, then obtain the relative
position of the radial load Fr and effective load centers.
The result will be as shown in Fig. 5.14. Consequently,
the radial load applied on bearings1(HR30305DJ) and
2 (HR30206J) can be obtained from the following
equations:
Fr1= 5 500 × 	= 1 569N, {160kgf}
Fr2 = 5 500 × 	= 3 931N, {401kgf}
From the data in the bearing table, the following values
are obtained;
When radial loads are applied on tapered roller
bearings, an axial load component is produced, which
must be considered to obtain the dynamic equivalent
radial load (Refer to Paragraph 5.4.2, Page A31).

5.7 Examples of Bearing Calculations
The basic load rating C r of 6208 is 29 100N, {2
970kgf} (Bearing Table, Page B10). Since only a radial
load is applied, the equivalent load P may be obtained
as follows:
P = Fr = 2 500N, {255kgf}
Since the speed is n = 900min–1, the speed factor fn
can be obtained from the equation in Table 5.2 (Page
A25) or Fig. 5.3(Page A26).
fn = 0.333
The fatigue life factor fh, under these conditions, can
be calculated as follows:
fh = fn 	= 0.333 × 	= 3.88
This value is suitable for industrial applications, air
conditioners being regularly used, etc., and according
to the equation in Table 5.2 or Fig. 5.4 (Page A26), it
corresponds approximately to 29 000 hours of service
life.
The fatigue life factor fh of ball bearings with a rating
fatigue life longer than 10 000 hours is fh≥2.72.
Because fn = 0.26, P = Fr = 3 000N. {306kgf}
fh = fn 	= 0.26 × 	≥2.72
therefore, Cr≥2.72 × 	= 31 380N, {3 200kgf}
Among the data listed in the bearing table on Page
B12, 6210 should be selected as one that satisfies the
above conditions.

When the radial load Fr and axial load Fa are applied
on single-row deep groove ball bearing 6208, the
dynamic equivalent load P should be calculated in
accordance with the following procedure.
Obtain the radial load factor X, axial load factor Y and
constant e obtainable, depending on the magnitude of
fo Fa /Cor, from the table above the single-row deep
groove ball bearing table.
The basic static load rating Cor of ball bearing 6208 is
17 900 N, {1 820kgf} (Page B10)
fo Fa /Cor = 14.0 × 1 000/17 900 = 0.782
eH0.26
and Fa / Fr = 1 000/2 500 = 0.4>e
X = 0.56
Y = 1.67 (the value of Y is obtained by linear
interpolation)
Therefore, the dynamic equivalent load P is
P = X Fr + Y Fa
= 0.56 × 2 500 + 1.67 × 1 000
= 3 070N, {313kgf}
= 	= 9.48
fh = fn 	= 0.333 × 	= 3.16
This value of fh corresponds approximately to 15 800
hours for ball bearings.
The value of the fatigue life factor fh which makes
Lh≥30 000h is bigger than 3.45 from Fig. 5.4 (Page
A26).

The speed of rolling bearings is subject to certain
limits. When bearings are operating, the higher the
speed, the higher the bearing temperature due to
friction. The limiting speed is the empirically obtained
value for the maximum speed at which bearings can be
continuously operated without failing from seizure or
generation of excessive heat. Consequently, the
limiting speed of bearings varies depending on such
factors as bearing type and size, cage form and
material, load, lubricating method, and heat dissipating
method including the design of the bearing's
surroundings.
The limiting speeds for bearings lubricated by grease
and oil are listed in the bearing tables. The limiting
speeds in the tables are applicable to bearings of
standard design and subjected to normal loads, i. e.
C/P≥12 and Fa /Fr ≤0.2 approximately. The limiting
speeds for oil lubrication listed in the bearing tables
are for conventional oil bath lubrication.
Some types of lubricants are not suitable for high
speed, even though they may be markedly superior in
other respects. When speeds are more than 70 percent
of the listed limiting speed, it is necessary to select an
oil or grease which has good high speed
characteristics.
(Refer to)
Table 12.2 Grease Properties (Pages A110 and 111)
Table 12.5 Example of Selection of Lubricant for Bearing
Operating Conditions (Page A113)
Table 15.8 Brands and Properties of Lubricating Grease
(Pages A138 to A141)
6.1 Correction of Limiting Speed
When the bearing load P exceeds 8% of the basic load
rating C, or when the axial load Fa exceeds 20% of the
radial load Fr, the limiting speed must be corrected by
multiplying the limiting speed found in the bearing
tables by the correction factor shown in Figs. 6.1 and
6.2.
When the required speed exceeds the limiting speed of
the desired bearing; then the accuracy grade, internal
clearance, cage type and material, lubrication, etc.,
must be carefully studied in order to select a bearing
capable of the required speed. In such a case, forced-
circulation oil lubrication, jet lubrication, oil mist
lubrication, or oil-air lubrication must be used.
If all these conditions are considered. The maximum
permissible speed may be corrected by multiplying the
limiting speed found in the bearing tables by the
correction factor shown in Table 6.1. It is
recommended that NSK be consulted regarding high
speed applications.
6.2 Limiting Speed for Rubber Contact Seals
for Ball Bearings
The maximum permissible speed for contact rubber
sealed bearings (DDU type) is determined mainly by
the sliding surface speed of the inner circumference of
the seal. Values for the limiting speed are listed in the
bearing tables.

For bearing1
Fr1= 1 569N, {160kgf}

In this application, heavy loads, shocks, and shaft

bearings are appropriate.
The following spherical roller bearings satisfy the
above size limitation (refer to Page B192)
since 	Fa / Fr = 0.20<e
the dynamic equivalent load P is
P = Fr + Y3 Fa
Judging from the fatigue life factor fh in Table 5.1 and
examples of applications (refer to Page A25), a value
of fh, between 3 and 5 seems appropriate.

7.1 Boundary Dimensions and Dimensions of
Snap Ring Grooves
7.1.1 Boundary Dimensions
The boundary dimensions of rolling bearings, which
are shown in Figs.7.1 through 7.5, are the dimensions
that define their external geometry. They include bore
diameter d, outside diameter D, width B, bearing
width(or height) T, chamfer dimension r, etc. It is
necessary to know all of these dimensions when
mounting a bearing on a shaft and in a housing. These
boundary dimensions have been internationally
standardized (ISO15) and adopted by JIS B 1512
(Boundary Dimensions of Rolling Bearings).
The boundary dimensions and dimension series of
radial bearings, tapered roller bearings, and thrust
bearings are listed in Table 7.1 to 7.3 (Pages A40 to
A49).
In these boundary dimension tables, for each bore
number, which prescribes the bore diameter, other
boundary dimensions are listed for each diameter
series and dimension series. A very large number of
series are possible; however, not all of them are
commercially available so more can be added in the
future. Across the top of each bearing table (7.1 to
7.3), representative bearing types and series symbols
are shown (refer to Table 7.5, Bearing Series Symbols,
Page A55).
The relative cross-sectional dimensions of radial
bearings (except tapered roller bearings) and thrust
bearings for the various series classifications are
shown in Figs. 7.6 and 7.7 respectively.
7.1.2 Dimensions of Snap Ring Grooves and
Locating Snap Rings
The dimensions of Snap ring grooves in the outer
surfaces of bearings are specified by ISO 464. Also,
the dimensions and accuracy of the locating snap rings
themselves are specified by ISO 464. The dimensions
of snap ring grooves and locating snap ring for
bearings of diameter series 8, 9, 0, 2, 3, and 4, are
shown in Table 7.4 (Pages A50 to A53).

The chamfer dimensions listed in this table do not necessarily apply to the following chamfers: (a) Chamfers of the grooves in outer rings that have snap ring grooves.
	(b) For thin section cylindrical roller bearings, the chamfers on side without rib and bearing bore (in case of an inner ring) or outer surface (in case of an outer ring).
	(c) For angular contact ball bearings, the chamfers between the front face and bore (in case of an inner ring) or outer surface (in case of an outer ring).
	(d) Chamfers on inner rings of bearings with tapered bores.

BOUNDARY DIMENSIONS AND IDENTIFYING NUMBERS FOR BEARINGS
7.2 Formulation of Bearing Numbers
Bearing numbers are alphanumeric combinations that
indicate the bearing type, boundary dimensions,
dimensional and running accuracies, internal
clearance, and other related specifications. They
consist of basic numbers and supplementary symbols.
The boundary dimensions of commonly used bearings
mostly conform to the organizational concept of ISO,
and the bearing numbers of these standard bearings
are specified by JIS B 1513 (Bearing Numbers for
Rolling Bearings). Due to a need for more detailed
classification, NSK uses auxiliary symbols other than
those specified by JIS.
Bearing numbers consist of a basic number and
supplementary symbols. The basic number indicates
the bearing series(type) and the width and diameter
series as shown in Table 7.5. Basic numbers,
supplementary symbols, and the meanings of common
numbers and symbols are listed in Table 7.6 (Pages
A56 and A57). The contact angle symbols and other
supplementary designations are shown in successive
columns from left to right in Table 7.6. For reference,
some examples of bearing designations are shown
here:

8.1 Bearing Tolerance Standards
The tolerances for the boundary dimensions and
running accuracy of rolling bearings are specified by
ISO 492/199/582 (Accuracies of Rolling Bearings).
Tolerances are specified for the following items:
Regarding bearing accuracy classes, besides ISO
normal accuracy, as the accuracy improves there are
Class 6X (for tapered roller bearings), Class 6, Class
5, Class 4, and Class 2, with Class 2 being the
highest in ISO. The applicable accuracy classes for
each bearing type and the correspondence of these
classes are shown in Table 8.1.

9.1 Fits
9.1.1 Importance of Proper Fits
In the case of a rolling bearing with the inner ring fitted
to the shaft with only slight interference, a harmful
circumferential slipping may occur between the inner
ring and shaft. This slipping of the inner ring, which is
called “creep”, results in a circumferential
displacement of the ring relative to the shaft if the
interference fit is not sufficiently tight. When creep
occurs, the fitted surfaces become abraded, causing
wear and considerable damage to the shaft. Abnormal
heating and vibration may also occur due to abrasive
metallic particles entering the interior of the bearing.
It is important to prevent creep by having sufficient
interference to firmly secure that ring which rotates to
either the shaft or housing. Creep cannot always be
eliminated using only axial tightening through the
bearing ring faces. Generally, it is not necessary,
however, to provide interference for rings subjected
only to stationary loads. Fits are sometimes made
without any interference for either the inner or outer
ring, to accommodate certain operating conditions, or
to facilitate mounting and dismounting. In this case, to
prevent damage to the fitting surfaces due to creep,
lubrication of other applicable methods should be
considered.
9.1.2 Selection of Fit
(1) Load Conditions and Fit
The proper fit may be selected from Table 9.1 based on
the load and operating conditions.
(2) Magnitude of Load and Interference
The interference of the inner ring is slightly reduced by
the bearing load; therefore, the loss of interference
should be estimated using the following equations:
where 	& d F : Interference decrease of inner ring
(mm)
d : Bearing bore diameter (mm)
B : Nominal inner ring width (mm)
Fr : Radial load applied on bearing
(N), {kgf}
9. FITS AND INTERNAL CLEARANCES
Therefore, the effective interference &d should be
larger than the interference given by Equation (9.1).
However, in the case of heavy loads where the radial
load exceeds 20% of the basic static load rating C 0 r,
under the operating condition, interference often
becomes shortage. Therefore, interference should be
estimated using Equation (9.2):
where 	& d : Effective interference (mm)
Fr : Radial load applied on bearing
(N), {kgf}
B : Nominal inner ring width (mm)
(3) Interference Variation Caused by Temperature
Difference between Bearing and Shaft or
Housing
The effective interference decreases due to the
increasing bearing temperature during operation. If the
temperature difference between the bearing and
housing is & T (°C), then the temperature difference
between the fitted surfaces of the shaft and inner ring
is estimated to be about (0.1~0.15) & T in case that
the shaft is cooled. The decrease in the interference of
the inner ring due to this temperature difference & d T
may be calculated using Equation (9.3):
& d T = (0.10~0.15) × & T⋅
α⋅d
H0.0015& T ⋅d × 10–3 ................... (9.3)
where & d T : Decrease in interference of inner ring
due to temperature difference (mm)
& T : Temperature difference between bearing
interior and surrounding parts (°C)
α : Coefficient of linear expansion of
bearing steel=12.5×10–6 (1/°C)
d : Bearing nominal bore diameter (mm)
In addition, depending on the temperature difference
between the outer ring and housing, or difference in
their coefficients of linear expansion, the interference
may increase.
(4) Effective Interference and Finish of Shaft and
Housing
Since the roughness of fitted surfaces is reduced
during fitting, the effective interference becomes less
than the apparent interference. The amount of this
interference decrease varies depending on the
roughness of the surfaces and may be estimated using
the following equations:
For ground shafts
For machined shafts
where 	& d : Effective interference (mm)
& d a : Apparent interference (mm)
d : Bearing nominal bore diameter (mm)
According to Equations (9.4) and (9.5), the effective
interference of bearings with a bore diameter of 30 to
150 mm is about 95% of the apparent interference.
(5) Fitting Stress and Ring Expansion and
Contraction
When bearings are mounted with interference on a
shaft or in a housing, the rings either expand or
contract and stress is produced. Excessive interference
may damage the bearings; therefore, as a general
guide, the maximum interference should be kept under
approximately 7/10 000 of the shaft diameter.
The pressure between fitted surfaces, expansion or
contraction of the rings, and circumferential stress
may be calculated using the equations in Section 15.2,
Fitting(1) (Pages A130 and 131).
9.1.3 Recommended Fits
As described previously, many factors, such as the
characteristics and magnitude of bearing load,
temperature differences, means of bearing mounting
and dismounting, must be considered when selecting
the proper fit.
If the housing is thin or the bearing is mounted on a
hollow shaft, a tighter than usual tit is necessary. A
split housing often deforms the bearing into an oval
shape; therefore, a split housing should be avoided
when a tight fit with the outer ring is required.
The fits of both the inner and outer rings should be
tight in applications where the shaft is subjected to
considerable vibration.
The recommended fits for some common applications
are shown in Table 9.2 to 9.7. In the case of unusual
operating conditions, it is advisable to consult NSK.
For the accuracy and surface finish of shafts and
housings, please refer to Section 11.1 (Page A100).

FITS AND INTERNAL CLEARANCES
9.2 Bearing Internal Clearances
9.2.1 Internal Clearances and Their Standards
The internal clearance in rolling bearings in operation
greatly influences bearing performance including
fatigue life, vibration, noise, heart-generation, etc.
Consequently, the selection of the proper internal
clearance is one of the most important tasks when
choosing a bearing after the type and size have been
determined.
This bearing internal clearance is the combined
clearances between the inner/outer rings and rolling
elements. The radial and axial clearances are defined
as the total amount that one ring can be displaced
relative to the other in the radial and axial directions
respectively (Fig. 9.1).
To obtain accurate measurements, the clearance is
generally measured by applying a specified measuring
load on the bearing; therefore, the measured clearance
(sometimes called “measured clearance” to make a
distinction) is always slightly larger than the theoretical
internal clearance (called “geometrical clearance” for
radial bearings) by the amount of elastic deformation
caused by the measuring load.
Therefore, the theoretical internal clearance may be
obtained by correcting the measured clearance by the
amount of elastic deformation. However, in the case of
roller bearings this elastic deformation is negligibly
small.
Usually the clearance before mounting is the one
specified as the theoretical internal clearance.
In Table 9.8, reference table and page numbers are
listed by bearing types.

Remarks This table is applicable to bearings in Tolerance Classes Normal and 6. For internal axial clearances in bearings in
tolerance classes better than 5 and contact angles of 15° and 25°, it is advisable to consult NSK.
9.2.2 Selection of Bearing Internal Clearances
Among the bearing internal clearances listed in the
tables, the CN Clearance is adequate for standard
operating conditions. The clearance becomes
progressively smaller from C2 to C1 and larger from
C3 to C5.
Standard operating conditions are defined as those
where the inner ring speed is less than approximately
50% of the limiting speed listed in the bearing tables,
the load is less than normal (PH0.1C r), and the
bearing is tight-fitted on the shaft.
As a measure to reduce bearing noise for electric
motors, the radial clearance range is narrower than the
normal class and the values are somewhat smaller for
deep groove ball bearings and cylindrical roller
bearings for electric motors. (Refer to Table 9.13.1 and
9.13.2)
Internal clearance varies with the fit and temperature
differences in operation. The changes in radial
clearance in a roller bearing are shown in Fig. 9.2.
(1) Decrease in Radial Clearance Caused by Fitting
and Residual Clearance
When the inner ring or the outer ring is tight-fitted on a
shaft or in a housing, a decrease in the radial internal
clearance is caused by the expansion or contraction of
the bearing rings. The decrease varies according to the
bearing type and size and design of the shaft and
housing. The amount of this decrease is approximately
70 to 90% of the interference (refer to Section 15.2,
Fits (1), Pages A130 to A133). The internal clearance
after subtracting this decrease from the theoretical
internal clearance & 0 is called the residual clearance,
&f.
(2) Decrease in Radial Internal Clearance Caused by
Temperature Differences between Inner and
Outer Rings and Effective Clearance
The frictional heat generated during operation is
conducted away through the shaft and housing. Since
housings generally conduct heat better than shafts, the
temperature of the inner ring and the rolling elements
is usually higher than that of the outer ring by 5 to 10
°C. If the shaft is heated or the housing is cooled, the
difference in temperature between the inner and outer
rings is greater. The radial clearance decreases due to
the thermal expansion caused by the temperature
difference between the inner and outer rings. The
amount of this decrease can be calculated using the
following equations:
δ tH
α& t De ..................................... (9.6)
where	
δ t : Decrease in radial clearance due to
temperature difference between inner and
outer rings (mm)
α : Coefficient of linear expansion of bearing
steelH12.5×10−6 (1/°C)
& t : Temperature difference between inner and
outer rings (°C)
De : Outer ring raceway diameter (mm)
For ball bearings
DeH 	(4D +d) ..................... (9.7)
For roller bearings
DeH 	(3D +d) ..................... (9.8)
The clearance after substracting this
δ t from the
residual clearance, & f is called the effective clearance,
& . Theoretically, the longest life of a bearing can be
expected when the effective clearance is slightly
negative. However, it is difficult to achieve such an
ideal condition, and an excessive negative clearance
will greatly shorten the bearing life. Therefore, a
clearance of zero or a slightly positive amount, instead
of a negative one, should be selected. When single-row
angular contact ball bearings or tapered roller bearings
are used facing each other, there should be a small
effective clearance, unless a preload is required. When
two cylindrical roller bearings with a rib on one side
are used facing each other, it is necessary to provide
adequate axial clearance to allow for shaft elongation
during operation.
The radial clearances used in some specific
applications are given in Table9.19. Under special
operating conditions, it is advisable to consult NSK.

Rolling bearings usually retain some internal clearance
while in operation. In some cases, however, it is
desirable to provide a negative clearance to keep them
internally stressed. This is called “preloading„. A
preload is usually applied to bearings in which the
clearance can be adjusted during mounting, such as
angular contact ball bearings or tapered roller
bearings. Usually, two bearings are mounted face-to-
face or back-to-back to form a duplex set with a
preload.
10.1 Purpose of Preload
The main purposes and some typical applications of
preloaded bearings are as follows:
(1) To maintain the bearings in exact position both
radially and axially and to maintain the running
accuracy of the shaft.
...Main shafts of machine tools, precision
instruments, etc.
(2) To increase bearing rigidity
...Main shafts of machine tools, pinion shafts of
final drive gears of automobiles, etc.
(3) To minimize noise due to axial vibration and
resonance
...Small electric motors, etc.
(4) To prevent sliding between the rolling elements and
raceways due to gyroscopic moments
...High speed or high acceleration applications of
angular contact ball bearings, and thrust ball
bearings
(5) To maintain the rolling elements in their proper
position with the bearing rings
...Thrust ball bearings and spherical thrust roller
bearings mounted on a horizontal shaft
10.2 Preloading Methods
10.2.1 Position Preload
A position preload is achieved by fixing two axially
opposed bearings in such a way that a preload is
imposed on them. Their position, once fixed, remain
unchanged while in operation.
In practice, the following three methods are generally
used to obtain a position preload.
(1) By installing a duplex bearing set with previously
adjusted stand-out dimensions (see Page A7, Fig.
1.1) and axial clearance.
(2) By using a spacer or shim of proper size to obtain
the required spacing and preload. (Refer to Fig.
10.1)
(3) By utilizing bolts or nuts to allow adjustment of the
axial preload. In this case, the starting torque
should be measured to verify the proper preload.
10.2.2 Constant-Pressure Preload
A constant pressure preload is achieved using a coil or
leaf spring to impose a constant preload. Even if the
relative position of the bearings changes during
operation, the magnitude of the preload remains
relatively constant (refer to Fig. 10.2)
10.3 Preload and Rigidity
10.3.1 Position Preload and Rigidity
When the inner rings of the duplex bearings shown in
Fig.10.3 are fixed axially, bearings A and B are
displaced
δa0 and axial space 2
δa0 between the inner
rings is eliminated. With this condition, a preload Fa0
is imposed on each bearing. A preload diagram
showing bearing rigidity, that is the relation between
load and displacement with a given axial load Fa
imposed on a duplex set, is shown in Fig. 10.4.

10.3.2 Constant-Pressure Preload and Rigidity
A preload diagram for duplex bearings under a
constant-pressure preload is shown in Fig. 10.5. The
deflection curve of the spring is nearly parallel to the
horizontal axis because the rigidity of springs is lower
than that of the bearing. As a result, the rigidity under
a constant-pressure preload is approximately equal to
that for a single bearing with a preload Fa 0 applied to
it. Fig. 10.6 presents a comparison of the rigidity of a
bearing with a position preload and one with a
constant-pressure preload.
10.4 Selection of Preloading Method and
Amount of Preload
10.4.1 Comparison of Preloading Methods
A comparison of the rigidity using both preloading
methods is shown in Fig. 10.6. The position preload
and constant-pressure preload may be compared as
follows:
(1) When both of the preloads are equal, the position
preload provides greater bearing rigidity, in other
words, the deflection due to external loads is less
for bearings with a position preload.
(2) In the case of a position preload, the preload varies
depending on such factors as a difference in axial
expansion due to a temperature difference between
the shaft and housing, a difference in radial
expansion due to a temperature difference between
the inner and outer rings, deflection due to load,
etc.
In the case of a constant-pressure preload, it is
possible to minimize any change in the preload
because the variation of the spring load with shaft
expansion and contraction is negligible. From the
foregoing explanation, it is seen that position preloads
are generally preferred for increasing rigidity and
constant-pressure preloads are more suitable for high
speed applications, for prevention of axial vibration, for
use with thrust bearings on horizontal shafts, etc.

PRELOAD
10.4.2 Amount of Preload
If the preload is larger than necessary, abnormal heart
generation, increased frictional torque, reduced fatigue
life, etc. may occur. The amount of the preload should
be carefully determined considering the operating
conditions and the purpose of the preload.
(1) Preloading of Duplex Angular Contact Ball
Bearings
Average preloads for duplex angular contact ball
bearings (contact angle of 15°) with precision better
than P5 class, which are used on the main shafts of
machine tools, are listed in Table 10.2.
The recommended fitting between the shaft and inner
ring and between the housing and outer ring are listed
in Table 10.1. In the case of fits with housings, the
lower limit of the fitting range should be selected for
fixed-end bearings and the upper limit for free-end
bearings.
As a general rule, an extra light or light preload should
be selected for grinding spindles and the main shafts
of machining centers, while a medium preload should
be adopted for the main shafts of lathes requiring
rigidity.
When speeds result in a value of Dpw×n (dmn value)
higher than 500000, the preload should be very
carefully studied and selected. In such a case, please
consult with NSK beforehand.
(2) Preload of Thrust Ball Bearings
When the balls in thrust ball bearings rotate at
relatively high speeds, sliding due to gyroscopic
moments on the balls may occur. The larger of the two
values obtained from Equations(10.1) and (10.2)
below should be adopted as the minimum axial load in
order to prevent such sliding
Fa min = 	( 	)2 ........................ (10.1)
Fa min = 	................................ (10.2)
where 	Fa min : Minimum axial load (N), {kgf}
n : Speed (min–1)
C 0a : Basic static load rating (N), {kgf}
Nmax : Limiting speed (oil lubrication) (min–1)
(3) Preload of Spherical Thrust Roller Bearings
When spherical thrust roller bearings are used, damage
such as scoring may occur due to sliding between the
rollers and outer ring raceway. The minimum axial load
Fa min necessary to prevent such sliding is obtained
from the following equation:

11.1 Accuracy and Surface Finish of Shafts
and Housings
If the accuracy of a shaft or housing does not meet the
specification, the performance of the bearings will be
affected and they will not provide their full capability.
For example, inaccuracy in the squareness of the shaft
shoulder may cause misalignment of the bearing inner
and outer rings, which may reduce the bearing fatigue
life by adding an edge load in addition to the normal
load. Cage fracture and seizure sometimes occur for
this same reason. Housings should be rigid in order to
provide firm bearing support. High rigidity housings
are advantageous also from he standpoint of noise,
load distribution, etc.
For normal operating conditions, a turned finish or
smooth bored finish is sufficient for the fitting surface;
however, a ground finish is necessary for applications
where vibration and noise must be low or where heavy
loads are applied.
In cases where two or more bearings are mounted in
one single-piece housing, the fitting surfaces of the
housing bore should be designed so both bearing
seats may be finished together with one operation
such as in -line boring. In the case of split housings,
care must be taken in the fabrication of the housing so
the outer ring will not become deformed during
installation. The accuracy and surface finish of shafts
and housings are listed in Table 11.1 for normal
operating conditions.
11.2 Shoulder and Fillet Dimensions
The shoulders of the shaft or housing in contact with
the face of a bearing must be perpendicular to the
shaft center line. (Refer to Table 11.1) The front face
side shoulder bore of the housing for a tapered roller
bearing should be parallel with the bearing axis in
order to avoid interference with the cage.
The fillets of the shaft and housing should not come in
contact with the bearing chamfer; therefore, the fillet
radius ra must be smaller than the minimum bearing
chamfer dimension r or r1 .
The shoulder heights for both shafts and housings for
radial bearings should be sufficient to provide good
support over the face of the bearings, but enough face
should extend beyond the shoulder to permit use of
special dismounting tools. The recommended
minimum shoulder heights for metric series radial
bearings are listed in Table 11.2
Nominal dimensions associated with bearing mounting
are listed in the bearing tables including the proper
shoulder diameters. Sufficient shoulder height is
particularly important for supporting the side ribs of
tapered roller bearings and cylindrical roller bearings
subjected to high axial loads.
The values of h and ra in Table 11.2 should be adopted
in those cases where the fillet radius of the shaft or
housing is as shown in Fig. 11.2 (a), while the values
in Table 11.3 are generally used with an undercut fillet
radius produced when grinding the shaft as shown in
Fig. 11.2 (b).

Remarks In cases that the outer ring is mounted in the
housing bore with interference or that a thin cross-
section bearing is mounted on a shaft and housing,
the accuracy of the shaft and housing should be
higher since this affects the bearing raceway
directly.
Remarks 1. When heavy axial loads are applied, the
shoulder height must be sufficiently higher than
the values listed.

(2) Flinger (Slinger) Type Seals
A flinger is designed to force water and dust away by
means of the centrifugal force acting on any
contaminants on the shaft. Sealing mechanisms with
flingers inside the housing as shown in Fig. 11.6 (a),
(b) are mainly intended to prevent oil leakage, and are
used in environments with relatively little dust. Dust
and moisture are prevented from entering by the
centrifugal force of flingers shown in Figs 11.6 (c), (d).
(3) Labyrinth Seals
Labyrinth seals are formed by interdigitated segments
attached to the shaft and housing that are separated by
a very small gap. They are particularly suitable for
preventing oil leakage from the shaft at high speeds.
The type shown in Fig. 11.7 (a) is widely used because
of its ease of assembly, but those shown in Fig. 11.7
(b), (c) have better seal effectiveness.
For thrust bearings, the squareness and contact area of
the supporting face for the bearing rings must be
adequate. In the case of thrust ball bearings, the
housing shoulder diameter Da should be less than the
pitch circle diameter of the balls, and the shaft
shoulder diameter da should be greater than the pitch
circle diameter of the balls (Fig. 11.3).
For thrust roller bearings, it is advisable for the full
contact length between rollers and rings to be
supported by the shaft and housing shoulder (Fig.
11.4).
These diameters da and Da are listed in the bearing
tables.
11.3 Bearing Seals
To insure the longest possible life of a bearing, it may
be necessary to provide seals to prevent leakage of
lubricant and entry of dust, water and other harmful
material like metallic particles. The seals must be free
from excessive running friction and the probability of
seizure. They should also be easy to assemble and
disassemble. It is necessary to select a suitable seal
for each application considering the lubricating
method.
11.3.1 Non-Contact Type Seals
Various sealing devices that do not contact the shaft,
such as oil grooves, flingers, and labyrinths, are
available. Satisfactory sealing can usually be obtained
with such seals because of their close running
clearance. Centrifugal force may also assist in
preventing internal contamination and leakage of the
lubricant.
(1) Oil Groove Seals
The effectiveness of oil groove seals is obtained by
means of the small gap between the shaft and housing
bore and by multiple grooves on either or both of the
housing bore and shaft surface (Fig. 11.5 (a), (b)).
Since the use of oil grooves alone is not completely
effective, except at low speeds, a flinger or labyrinth
type seal is often combined with an oil groove seal
(Fig. 11.5 (c)). The entry of dust is impeded by packing
grease with a consistency of about 200 into the
grooves.
The smaller the gap between the shaft and housing,
the greater the sealing effect; however, the shaft and
housing must not come in contact while running. The
recommended gaps are given in Table 11.4.
The recommended groove width is approximately 3 to
5mm, with a depth of about 4 to 5mm. In the case of
sealing methods using grooves only, there should be
three or more grooves.

12.1 Purposes of Lubrication
The main purposes of lubrication are to reduce friction
and wear inside the bearings that may cause
premature failure. The effects of lubrication may be
briefly explained as follows:
(1) Reduction of Friction and Wear
Direct metallic contact between the bearing rings,
rolling elements and cage, which are the basic
components of a bearing, is prevented by an oil film
which reduces the friction and wear in the contact
areas.
(2) Extension of Fatigue Life
The rolling fatigue life of bearings depends greatly
upon the viscosity and film thickness between the
rolling contact surfaces. A heavy film thickness
prolongs the fatigue life, but it is shortened if the
viscosity of the oil is too low so the film thickness is
insufficient.
(3) Dissipation of Frictional Heat and Cooling
Circulation lubrication may be used to carry away
frictional heat or heat transferred from the outside to
prevent the bearing from overheating and the oil from
deteriorating.
(4) Others
Adequate lubrication also helps to prevent foreign
material from entering the bearings and guards against
corrosion or rusting.
12.2 Lubricating Methods
The various lubricating methods are first divided into
either grease or oil lubrication. Satisfactory bearing
performance can be achieved by adopting the
lubricating method which is most suitable for the
particular application and operating condition.
In general, oil offers superior lubrication; however,
grease lubrication allows a simpler structure around
the bearings. A comparison of grease and oil
lubrication is given in Table 12.1.
12.2.1 Grease Lubrication
(1) Grease Quantity
The quantity of grease to be packed in a housing
depends on the housing design and free space, grease
characteristics, and ambient temperature. For example,
the bearings for the main shafts of machine tools,
where the accuracy may be impaired by a small
temperature rise, require only a small amount of
grease. The quantity of grease for ordinary bearings is
determined as follows.
Sufficient grease must be packed inside the bearing
including the cage guide face. The available space
inside the housing to be packed with grease depends
on the speed as follows:
1/2 to 2/3 of the space … When the speed is less than
50% of the limiting speed.
1/3 to 1/2 of the space … When the speed is more than
50% of the limiting speed.
12. LUBRICATION
A 104
DESIGN OF SHAFTS AND HOUSINGS
11.3.2 Contact Type Seals
The effectiveness of contact seals is achieved by the
physical contact between the shaft and seal, which
may be made of synthetic rubber, synthetic resin, felt,
etc. Oil seals with synthetic rubber lips are most
frequently used.
(1) Oil Seals
Many types of oil seals are used to prevent lubricant
from leaking out as well as to prevent dust, water, and
other foreign matter from entering (Figs. 11.8 and
11.9)
In Japan, such oil seals are standardized (Refer to JIS
B 2402) on the basis of type and size. Since many oil
seals are equipped with circumferential springs to
maintain adequate contact force, oil seals can follow
the non-uniform rotational movement of a shaft to
some degree.
Seal lip materials are usually synthetic rubber including
nitrile, acrylate, silicone, and fluorine. Tetrafluoride
ethylene is also used. The maximum allowable
operating temperature for each material increases in
this same order.
Synthetic rubber oil seals may cause trouble such as
overheating, wear, and seizure, unless there is an oil
film between the seal lip and shaft. Therefore, some
lubricant should be applied to the seal lip when the
seals are installed. It is also desirable for the lubricant
inside the housing to spread a little between the sliding
surfaces.
The permissible circumferential speed for oil seals
varies depending on the type, the finish of the shaft
surface, liquid to be sealed, temperature, shaft
eccentricity, etc. The temperature range for oil seals is
restricted by the lip material. Approximate
circumferential surface speeds and temperature
permitted under favorable conditions are listed in Table
11.6.
When oil seals are used at high circumferential surface
speed or under high internal pressure, the contact
surface of the shaft must be smoothly finished and the
shaft eccentricity should be less than 0.02 to 0.05mm.
The hardness of the shaft's contact surface should be
made higher than HRC40 by means of heat treatment
or hard chrome plating in order to gain abrasion
resistance. If possible, a hardness of more than HRC
55 is recommended.
The approximate level of contact surface finish
required for several shaft circumferential surface
speeds is given in Table 11.7.
(2) Felt Seals
Felt seals are one of the simplest and most common
seals being used for transmission shafts, etc.
However, since oil permeation and leakage are
unavoidable if oil is used, this type of seal is used only
for grease lubrication, primarily to prevent dust and
other foreign matter from entering. Felt seals are not
suitable for circumferential surface speeds exceeding
4m/sec; therefore, it is preferable to replace them with
synthetic rubber seals depending on the application.

Notes (1 ) Mineral-oil base greases (e.g. lithium soap
base grease) which are often used over a
temperature range of around – 10 to 110 °C.
Notes (2 ) Synthetic-oil base greases are usable over
a wide temperature range of around – 40 to
130 °C.
12.2.2 Oil Lubrication
(1) Oil Bath Lubrication
Oil bath lubrication is a widely used with low or
medium speeds. The oil level should be at the center of
the lowest rolling element. It is desirable to provide a
sight gauge so the proper oil level may be maintained
(Fig. 12.4)
(2) Drip-Feed Lubrication
Drip feed lubrication is widely used for small ball
bearings operated at relatively high speeds. As shown
in Fig. 12.5, oil is stored in a visible oiler. The oil drip
rate is controlled with the screw in the top.
(2) Replacement of Grease
Grease, once packed, usually need not be replenished
for a long time; however, for severe operating
conditions, grease should be frequently replenished or
replaced. In such cases, the bearing housing should be
designed to facilitate grease replenishment and
replacement.
When replenishment intervals are short, provide
replenishment and discharge ports at appropriate
positions so deteriorated grease is replaced by fresh
grease. For example, the housing space on the grease
supply side can be divided into several sections with
partitions. The grease on the partitioned side gradually
passes through the bearings and old grease forced
from the bearing is discharged through a grease valve
(Fig. 12.1). If a grease valve is not used, the space on
the discharge side is made larger than the partitioned
side so it can retain the old grease, which is removed
periodically by removing the cover.
(3) Replenishing Interval
Even if high-quality grease is used, there is
deterioration of its properties with time; therefore,
periodic replenishment is required. Figs 12.2 (1) and
(2) show the replenishment time intervals for various
bearing types running at different speeds. Figs.12.2 (1)
and (2) apply for the condition of high-quality lithium
soap-mineral oil grease, bearing temperature of 70°C,
and normal load (P/C=0.1).
· Temperature
If the bearing temperature exceeds 70°C, the
replenishment time interval must be reduced by half
for every 15°C temperature rise of the bearings.
· Grease
In case of ball bearings especially, the replenishing
time interval can be extended depending on used
grease type. (For example, high-quality lithium soap-
synthetic oil grease may extend about two times of
replenishing time interval shown in Fig.12.2 (1). If the
temperature of the bearings is less than 70°C, the
usage of lithium soap-mineral oil grease or lithium
soap-synthetic oil grease is appropriate.)
It is advisable to consult NSK.
· Load
The replenishing time interval depends on the
magnitude of the bearing load.
Please refer to Fig.12.2 (3).
If P/C exceeds 0.16, it is advisable to consult NSK.

This lubricating method is used in bearings for the
high speed spindles of machine tools, high speed
pumps, roll necks of rolling mills, etc (Fig. 12.9).
For oil mist lubrication of large bearings, it is advisable
to consult NSK.
(7) Oil/Air Lubricating Method
Using the oil/air lubricating method, a very small
amount of oil is discharged intermittently by a
constant-quantity piston into a pipe carrying a constant
flow of compressed air. The oil flows along the wall of
the pipe and approaches a constant flow rate.
The major advantages of oil/air lubrication are:
(a) Since the minimum necessary amount of oil is
supplied, this method is suitable for high speeds
because less heat is generated.
(b) Since the minimum amount of oil is fed
continuously, bearing temperature remains stable.
Also, because of the small amount of oil, there is
almost no atmospheric pollution.
(c) Since only fresh oil is fed to the bearings, oil
deterioration need not be considered.
(d) Since compressed air is always fed to the bearings,
the internal pressure is high, so dust, cutting fluid, etc.
cannot enter.
For these reasons, this method is used in the main
spindles of machine tools and other high speed
applications (Fig. 12.1O).
(3) Splash Lubrication
With this lubricating method, oil is splashed onto the
bearings by gears or a simple rotating disc installed
near bearings without submerging the bearings in oil.
It is commonly used in automobile transmissions and
final drive gears. Fig. 12.6 shows this lubricating
method used on a reduction gear.
(4) Circulating Lubrication
Circulating lubrication is commonly used for high
speed operation requiring bearing cooling and for
bearings used at high temperatures. As shown in Fig.
12.7 (a), oil is supplied by the pipe on the right side, it
travels through the bearing, and drains out through the
pipe on the left. After being cooled in a reservoir, it
returns to the bearing through a pump and filter.
The oil discharge pipe should be larger than the supply
pipe so an excessive amount of oil will not back up in
the housing.
(5) Jet Lubrication
Jet lubrication is often used for ultra high speed
bearings, such as the bearings in jet engines with a
dmn valve (dm: pitch diameter of rolling element set in
mm; n: rotational speed in min–1) exceeding one
million. Lubricating oil is sprayed under pressure from
one or more nozzles directly into the bearing.
Fig. 12.8 shows an example of ordinary jet lubrication.
The lubricating oil is sprayed on the inner ring and
cage guide face. In the case of high speed operation,
the air surrounding the bearing rotates with it causing
the oil jet to be deflected. The jetting speed of the oil
from the nozzle should be more than 20% of the
circumferential speed of the inner ring outer surface
(which is also the guide face for the cage).
More uniform cooling and a better temperature
distribution is achieved using more nozzles for a given
amount of oil. It is desirable for the oil to be forcibly
discharged so the agitating resistance of the lubricant
can be reduced and the oil can effectively carry away
the heat.
(6) Oil Mist Lubrication
Oil mist lubrication, also called oil fog lubrication,
utilizes an oil mist sprayed into a bearing. This method
has the following advantages:
(a) Because of the small quantity of oil required, the oil
agitation resistance is small, and higher speeds are
possible.
(b) Contamination of the vicinity around the bearing is
slight because the oil leakage is small.
(c) It is relatively easy to continuously supply fresh oil;
therefore, the bearing life is extended.

12.3 Lubricants
12.3.1 Lubricating Grease
Grease is a semi-solid lubricant consisting of base oil,
a thickener and additives. The main types and general
properties of grease are shown in Table 12.2. It should
be remembered that different brands of the same type
of grease may have different properties.
(1) Base Oil
Mineral oils or synthetic oils such as silicone or diester
oil are mainly used as the base oil for grease. The
lubricating properties of grease depend mainly on the
characteristics of its base oil. Therefore, the viscosity
of the base oil is just as important when selecting
grease as when selecting an oil. Usually, grease made
with low viscosity base oils is more suitable for high
speeds and low temperatures, while greases made
with high viscosity base oils are more suited for high
temperatures and heavy loads.
However, the thickener also influences the lubricating
properties of grease; therefore, the selection criteria for
grease is not the same as for lubricating oil.
(2) Thickener
As thickeners for lubricating grease, there are several
types of metallic soaps, inorganic thickeners such as
silica gel and bentonite, and heat resisting organic
thickeners such as polyurea and fluoric compounds.
The type of thickener is closely related to the grease
dropping point (1); generally, grease with a high
dropping point also has a high temperature capability
during operation. However, this type of grease does
not have a high working temperature unless the base
oil is heat-resistant. The highest possible working
temperature for grease should be determined
considering the heat resistance of the base oil.
The water resistance of grease depends upon the type
of thickener. Sodium soap grease or compound grease
containing sodium soap emulsifies when exposed to
water or high humidity, and therefore, cannot be used
where moisture is prevalent.
(3) Additives
Grease often contains various additives such as
antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, and extreme
pressure additives to give it special properties. It is
recommended that extreme pressure additives be used
in heavy load applications. For long use without
replenishment, an antioxidant should be added.
(4) Consistency
Consistency indicates the “softness” of grease. Table
12.3 shows the relation between consistency and
working conditions.
(5) Mixing Different Types of Grease
In general, different brands of grease must not be
mixed. Mixing grease with different types of
thickneners may destroy its composition and physical
properties. Even if the thickeners are of the same type,
possible differences in the additive may cause
detrimental effects.
Note (1) The grease dropping point is that temperature at
which a grease heated in a specified small
container becomes sufficiently fluid to drip.

Oil Replacement Intervals
Oil replacement intervals depend on the operating
conditions and oil quantity.
In those cases where the operating temperature is less
than 50˚C, and the environmental conditions are good
with little dust, the oil should be replaced
approximately once a year. However, in cases where
the oil temperature is about 100˚C, the oil must be
changed at least once every three months.
If moisture may enter or if foreign matter may be
mixed in the oil, then the oil replacement interval must
be shortened.
Mixing different brands of oil must be prevented for
the same reason given previously for grease.
A 112
12.3.2 Lubricating Oil
The lubricating oils used for rolling bearings are
usually highly refined mineral oil or synthetic oil that
have a high oil film strength and superior oxidation and
corrosion resistance. When selecting a lubricating oil,
the viscosity at the operating conditions is important. If
the viscosity is too low, a proper oil film is not formed
and abnormal wear and seizure may occur. On the
other hand, if the viscosity is too high, excessive
viscous resistance may cause heating or large power
loss. In general, low viscosity oils should be used at
high speed; however, the viscosity should increase
with increasing bearing load and size.
Table 12.4 gives generally recommended viscosities
for bearings under normal operating conditions.
For use when selecting the proper lubricating oil, Fig.
12.11 shows the relationship between oil temperature
and viscosity, and examples of selection are shown in
Table 12.5.

NSK uses highly pure vacuum-degassed bearing steel
containing a minimum of oxygen, nitrogen, and
hydrogen compound impurities. The rolling fatigue life
of bearings has been remarkably improved using this
material combined with the appropriate heat treatment.
For special purpose bearings, high temperature
bearing steel, which has superior heat resistance, and
stainless steel having good corrosion resistance may
be used. The chemical composition of these special
materials are given in Tables 13.3 and 13.4.
13.2 Cage Materials
The low carbon steels shown in Table 13.5 are the
main ones for the pressed cages for bearings.
Depending on the purpose, brass or stainless steel
may be used. For machined cages, high strength brass
(Table 13.6) or carbon steel (Table 13.5) is used.
Sometimes synthetic resin is also used.
A 114
The bearing rings and rolling elements of rolling
bearings are subjected to repetitive high pressure with
a small amount of sliding. The cages are subjected to
tension and compression and sliding contact with the
rolling elements and either or both of the bearing
rings.
Therefore, the materials used for the rings, rolling
elements, and cages require the following
characteristics:
Other necessary characteristics, such as easy
production, shock and heat resistance, and corrosion
resistance, are required depending on individual
applications.
13.1 Materials for Bearing Rings and Rolling
Elements
Primarily, high carbon chromium bearing steel (Table
13.1) is used for the bearing rings and rolling
elements. Most NSK bearings are made of SUJ2
among the JIS steel types listed in Table 13.1, while
the larger bearings generally use SUJ3. The chemical
composition of SUJ2 is approximately the same as
AISI 52100 specified in the USA, DIN 100 Cr6 in
Germany, and BS 535A99 in England.
For bearings that are subjected to very severe shock
loads, carburized low-carbon alloy steels such as
chrome steel, chrome molybdenum steel, nickel
chrome molybdenum steel, etc. are often used. Such
steels, when they are carburized to the proper depth
and have sufficient surface hardness, are more shock
resistant than normal, through-hardened bearing steels
because of the softer energy-absorbing core. The
chemical composition of common carburized bearing
steels is listed in Table 13.2.

(2) Shrink Fits
Since press fitting large bearings requires a large
force, a shrink fit is widely used. The bearings are first
heated in oil to expand them before mounting.
This method prevents an excessive force from being
imposed on the bearings and allows mounting them in
a short time.
The expansion of the inner ring for various
temperature differences and bearing sizes is shown in
Fig. 14.3.
The precautions to follow when making shrink fits are
as follows:
(a) Do not heat bearings to more than 120˚C.
(b) Put the bearings on a wire net or suspend them in
an oil tank in order to prevent them from touching
the tank's bottom directly.
(c) Heat the bearings to a temperature 20˚ to 30˚C
higher than the lowest temperature required for
mounting without interference since the inner ring
will cool a little during mounting.
(d) After mounting, the bearings will shrink in the axial
direction as well as the radial direction while
cooling. Therefore, press the bearing firmly against
the shaft shoulder using locating methods to avoid
a clearance between the bearing and shoulder.
NSK Bearing Induction Heaters
Besides heating in oil, NSK Bearing Heaters, which
use electromagnetic induction to heat bearings, are
widely used. (Refer to Page C7.)
In NSK Bearing Heaters, electricity (AC) in a coil
produces a magnetic field that induces a current inside
the bearing that generates heat. Consequently, without
using flames or oil uniform heating in a short time is
possible, making bearing shrink fitting efficient and
clean.
In the case of relatively frequent mounting and
dismounting such as cylindrical roller bearings for roll
necks of rolling mills and for railway journal boxes,
induction heating should be used for mounting and
dismounting inner rings.
A 116
14.1 Precautions for Proper Handling of
Bearings
Since rolling bearings are high precision machine
parts, they must be handled accordingly. Even if high
quality bearings are used, their expected performance
cannot be achieved if they are not handled properly.
The main precautions to be observed are as follows:
(1) Keep Bearings and Surrounding Area Clean
Dust and dirt, even if invisible to the naked eye, have
harmful effects on bearings. It is necessary to prevent
the entry of dust and dirt by keeping the bearings and
their environment as clean as possible.
(2) Careful Handling
Heavy shocks during handling may cause bearings to
be scratched or otherwise damaged possibly resulting
in their failure. Excessively strong impacts may cause
brinelling, breaking, or cracking.
(3) Use Proper Tools
Always use the proper equipment when handling
bearings and avoid general purpose tools.
(4) Prevent Corrosion
Since perspiration on the hands and various other
contaminants may cause corrosion, keep the hands
clean when handling bearings. Wear gloves if possible.
Pay attention to rust of bearing caused by corrosive
gasses.
14.2 Mounting
The method of mounting rolling bearings strongly
affects their accuracy, life, and performance, so their
mounting deserves careful attention. Their
characteristics should first be thoroughly studied, and
then they should be mounted in the proper manner. It
is recommended that the handling procedures for
bearings be fully investigated by the design engineers
and that standards be established with respect to the
following items:
(1) Cleaning the bearings and related parts.
(2) Checking the dimensions and finish of related
parts.
(3) Mounting
(4) Inspection after mounting.
(5) Supply of lubricants.
Bearings should not be unpacked until immediately
before mounting. When using ordinary grease
lubrication, the grease should be packed in the
bearings without first cleaning them. Even in the case
of ordinary oil lubrication, cleaning the bearings is not
required. However, bearings for instruments or for
high speed operation must first be cleaned with clean
filtered oil in order to remove the anti-corrosion agent.
After the bearings are cleaned with filtered oil, they
should be protected to prevent corrosion.
Prelubricated bearings must be used without cleaning.
Bearing mounting methods depend on the bearing type
and type of fit. As bearings are usually used on rotating
shafts, the inner rings require a tight fit.
Bearings with cylindrical bores are usually mounted by
pressing them on the shafts (press fit) or heating them
to expand their diameter (shrink fit). Bearings with
tapered bores can be mounted directly on tapered
shafts or cylindrical shafts using tapered sleeves.
Bearings are usually mounted in housings with a loose
fit. However, in cases where the outer ring has an
interference fit, a press may be used. Bearings can be
interference-fitted by cooling them before mounting
using dry ice. In this case, a rust preventive treatment
must be applied to the bearing because moisture in the
air condenses on its surface.
14.2.1 Mounting of Bearings with Cylindrical Bores
(1) Press Fits
Fitting with a press is widely used for small bearings. A
mounting tool is placed on the inner ring as shown in
Fig. 14.1 and the bearing is slowly pressed on the shaft
with a press until the side of the inner ring rests
against the shoulder of the shaft. The mounting tool
must not be placed on the outer ring for press
mounting, since the bearing may be damaged. Before
mounting, applying oil to the fitted shaft surface is
recommended for smooth insertion. The mounting
method using a hammer should only be used for small
ball bearings with minimally tight fits and when a press
is not available. In the case of tight interference fits or
for medium and large bearings, this method should
not be used. Any time a hammer is used, a mounting
tool must be placed on the inner ring.
When both the inner and outer rings of non-separable
bearings, such as deep groove ball bearings, require
tight-fit, a mounting tool is placed on both rings as
shown in Fig. 14.2, and both rings are fitted at the
same time using a screw or hydraulic press. Since the
outer ring of self-aligning ball bearings may deflect a
mounting tool such as that shown in Fig. 14.2 should
always be used for mounting them.
In the case of separable bearings, such as cylindrical
roller bearings and tapered roller bearings, the inner
and outer rings may be mounted separately. Assembly
of the inner and outer rings, which were previously
mounted separately, should be done carefully to align
the inner and outer rings correctly. Careless or forced
assembly may cause scratches on the rolling contact
surfaces.

Large machines, which cannot be turned by hand, can
be started after examination with no load, and the
power immediately cutoff and the machine allowed to
coast to a stop. Confirm that there is no abnormality
such as vibration, noise, contact of rotating parts, etc.
Powered operation should be started slowly without
load and the operation should be observed carefully
until it is determined that no abnormalities exist, then
gradually increase the speed, load, etc. to their normal
levels. Items to be checked during the test operation
include the existence of abnormal noise, excessive rise
of bearing temperature, leakage and contamination of
lubricants, etc. If any abnormality is found during the
test operation, it must be stopped immediately and the
machine should be inspected. If necessary, the bearing
should be dismounted for examination.
A 118
14.2.2 Mounting of Bearings with Tapered Bores
Bearings with tapered bores are mounted on tapered
shafts directly or on cylindrical shafts with adapters or
withdrawal sleeves (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5). Large
spherical roller bearings are often mounted using
hydraulic pressure. Fig. 14.6 shows a bearing
mounting utilizing a sleeve and hydraulic nut. Fig. 14.7
shows another mounting method. Holes are drilled in
the sleeve which are used to feed oil under pressure to
the bearing seat. As the bearing expands radially, the
sleeve is inserted axially with adjusting bolts.
Spherical roller bearings should be mounted while
checking their radial-clearance reduction and referring
to the push-in amounts listed in Table 14.1. The radial
clearance must be measured using clearance gauges.
In this measurement, as shown in Fig. 14.8, the
clearance for both rows of rollers must be measured
simultaneously, and these two values should be kept
roughly the same by adjusting the relative position of
the outer and inner rings.
When a large bearing is mounted on a shaft, the outer
ring may be deformed into an oval shape by its own
weight. If the clearance is measured at the lowest part
of the deformed bearing, the measured value may be
bigger than the true value. If an incorrect radial internal
clearance is obtained in this manner and the values in
Table 14.1 are used, then the interference fit may
become too tight and the true residual clearance may
become too small. In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.9.
one half of the total clearance at points 	and b (which
are on a horizontal line passing through the bearing
center) and c (which is at the lowest position of the
bearing) may be used as the residual clearance.
When a self-aligning ball bearing is mounted on a shaft
with an adapter, be sure that the residual clearance
does not become too small. Sufficient clearance for
easy alignment of the outer ring must be allowed.
14.3 Operation Inspection
After the mounting has been completed, a running test
should be conducted to determine if the bearing has
been mounted correctly. Small machines may be
manually operated to assure that they rotate smoothly.
Items to be checked include sticking due to foreign
matter or visible flaws, uneven torque caused by
improper mounting or an improper mounting surface,
and excessive torque caused by an inadequate
clearance, mounting error, or seal friction. If there are
no abnormalities, powered operation may be started.

Although the bearing temperature can generally be
estimated by the temperature of the outside surface of
the housing, it is more desirable to directly measure
the temperature of the outer ring using oil holes for
access.
The bearing temperature should rise gradually to the
steady state level within one to two hours after the
operation starts. If the bearing or its mounting is
improper, the bearing temperature may increase
rapidly and become abnormally high. The cause of this
abnormal temperature may be an excessive amount of
lubricant, insufficient bearing clearance, incorrect
mounting, or excessive friction of the seals.
In the case of high speed operation, an incorrect
selection of bearing type or lubricating method may
also cause an abnormal temperature rise.
The sound of a bearing may be checked with a noise
locater or other instruments. Abnormal conditions are
indicated by a loud metallic sound, or other irregular
noise, and the possible cause may include incorrect
lubrication, poor alignment of the shaft and housing,
or the entry of foreign matter into the bearing. The
possible causes and countermeasures for irregularities
are listed in Table 14.2.

14.4 Dismounting
A bearing may be removed for periodic inspection or
for other reasons. If the removed bearing is to be used
again or it is removed only for inspection, it should be
dismounted as carefully as when it was mounted. If the
bearing has a tight fit, its removal may be difficult. The
means for removal should be considered in the original
design of the adjacent parts of the machine. When
dismounting, the procedure and sequence of removal
should first be studied using the machine drawing and
considering the type of mounting fit in order to
perform the operation properly.
14.4.1 Dismounting of Outer Rings
In order to remove an outer ring that is tightly fitted,
first place bolts in the push-out holes in the housing at
several locations on its circumference as shown in Fig.
14.10, and remove the outer ring by uniformly
tightening the bolts. These bolt holes should always be
fitted with blank plugs when not being used for
dismounting. In the case of separable bearings, such
as tapered roller bearings, some notches should be
made at several positions in the housing shoulder, as
shown in Fig. 14.11, so the outer ring may be pressed
out using a dismounting tool or by tapping it.
14.4.2 Dismounting of Bearings with Cylindrical
Bores
If the mounting design allows space to press out the
inner ring, this is an easy and fast method. In this
case, the withdrawal force should be imposed only on
the inner ring (Fig. 14.12). Withdrawal tools like those
shown in Figs. 14.13 and 14.14 are often used.
Note (1) Intermittent squeal or high-pitch noise may be heard in medium- to large-sized cylindrical roller bearings or ball
bearings that are operating under grease lubrication in low-temperature environments. Under such low-temperature
conditions, bearing temperature will not rise resulting in fatigue nor is grease performance affected. Although
intermittent squeal or high-pitch noise may occur under these conditions, the bearing is fully functional and can
continue to be used. In the event that greater noise reduction or quieter running properties are needed, please contact
your nearest NSK branch office.

14.5 Inspection of Bearings
14.5.1 Bearing Cleaning
When bearings are inspected, the appearance of the
bearings should first be recorded and the amount and
condition of the residual lubricant should be checked.
After the lubricant has been sampled for examination,
the bearings should be cleaned. In general, light oil or
kerosene may be used as a cleaning solution.
Dismounted bearings should first be given a
preliminary cleaning followed by a finishing rinse. Each
bath should be provided with a metal net to support
the bearings in the oil without touching the sides or
bottom of the tank. If the bearings are rotated with
foreign matter in them during preliminary cleaning, the
raceways may be damaged. The lubricant and other
deposits should be removed in the oil bath during the
initial rough cleaning with a brush or other means.
After the bearing is relatively clean, it is given the
finishing rinse. The finishing rinse should be done
carefully with the bearing being rotated while
immersed in the rinsing oil. It is necessary to always
keep the rinsing oil clean.
14.5.2 Inspection and Evaluation of Bearings
After being thoroughly cleaned, bearings should be
examined for the condition of their raceways and
external surfaces, the amount of cage wear, the
increase in internal clearance, and degradation of
tolerances. These should be carefully checked, in
addition to examination for possible damage or other
abnormalities, in order to determine the possibility for
its reuse.
In the case of small non-separable ball bearings, hold
the bearing horizontally in one hand, and then rotate
the outer ring to confirm that it turns smoothly.
Separable bearings such as tapered roller bearings
may be checked by individually examining their rolling
elements and the outer ring raceway.
Large bearings cannot be rotated manually; however,
the rolling elements, raceway surfaces, cages, and
contact surface of the ribs should be carefully
examined visually. The more important a bearing is,
the more carefully it should be inspected.
The determination to reuse a bearing should be made
only after considering the degree of bearing wear, the
function of the machine, the importance of the
bearings in the machine, operating conditions, and the
time until the next inspection. However, if any of the
following defects exist, reuse is impossible and
replacement is necessary.
(a) When there are cracks in the inner or outer rings,
rolling elements, or cage.
(b) When there is flaking of the raceway or rolling
elements.
(c) When there is significant smearing of the raceway
surfaces, ribs, or rolling elements.
(d) When the cage is significantly worn or rivets are
loose.
(e) When there is rust or scoring on the raceway
surfaces or rolling elements.
(f) When there are any significant impact or brinell
traces on the raceway surfaces or rolling elements.
(g) When there is significant evidence of creep on the
bore or the periphery of the outer ring.
(h) When discoloration by heat is evident.
( i ) When significant damage to the seals or shields of
grease sealed bearings has occurred.
A 122
In both cases, the claws of the tools must substantially
engage the face of the inner ring; therefore, it is
advisable to consider the size of the shaft shoulder or
to cut grooves in the shoulder to accommodate the
withdrawal tools (Fig. 14.14).
The oil injection method is usually used for the
withdrawal of large bearings. The withdrawal is
achieved easily by mean of oil pressure applied
through holes in the shaft. In the case of extra wide
bearings, the oil injection method is used together with
a withdrawal tool.
Induction heating is used to remove the inner rings of
NU and NJ types of cylindrical roller bearings. The
inner rings are expanded by brief local heating, and
then withdrawn (Fig. 14.15). Induction heating is also
used to mount several bearings of these types on a
shaft.
14.4.3 Dismounting of Bearings with Tapered Bores
When dismounting relatively small bearings with
adapters, the inner ring is held by a stop fastened to
the shaft and the nut is loosened several turns. This is
followed by hammering on the sleeve using a suitable
tool as shown in Fig. 14.18. Fig. 14.16 shows one
procedure for dismounting a withdrawal sleeve by
tightening the removal nut. If this procedure is difficult,
it may be possible to drill and tap bolt holes in the nut
and withdraw the sleeve by tightening the bolts as
shown in Fig. 14.17.
Large bearings may be withdrawn easily using oil
pressure. Fig. 14.19 illustrates the removal of a bearing
by forcing oil under pressure through a hole and
groove in a tapered shaft to expand the inner ring. The
bearing may suddenly move axially when the
interference is relieved during this procedure so a stop
nut is recommended for protection. Fig. 14.20 shows a
withdrawal using a hydraulic nut.

14.6 Maintenance and Inspection
14.6.1 Detecting and Correcting Irregularities
In order to maintain the original performance of a
bearing for as long as possible, proper maintenance
and inspection should be performed. If proper
procedures are used, many bearing problems can be
avoided and the reliability, productivity, and operating
costs of the equipment containing the bearings are all
improved. It is suggested that periodic maintenance be
done following the procedure specified. This periodic
maintenance encompasses the supervision of
operating conditions, the supply or replacement of
lubricants, and regular periodic inspection. Items that
should be regularly checked during operation include
bearing noise, vibration, temperature, and lubrication.
If an irregularity is found during operation, the cause
should be determined and the proper corrective
actions should be taken after referring to Table 14.2.
If necessary, the bearing should be dismounted and
examined in detail. As for the procedure for
dismounting and inspection, refer to Section 14.5,
Inspection of Bearings.
NSK BEARING MONITOR (Bearing Abnormality
Detector)
It is important during operation to detect signs of
irregularities early before damage becomes severe.
The NSK Bearing Monitor (see Page C5) is an
instrument that checks the condition of bearings and
gives a warning of any abnormality, or it stops a
machine automatically in order to prevent serious
trouble. In addition, it helps to improve maintenance
and reduce its cost.
14.6.2 Bearing Failures and Countermeasures
In general, if rolling bearings are used correctly they
will survive to their predicted fatigue life. However,
they often fail prematurely due to avoidable mistakes.
In contrast to fatigue life, this premature failure is
caused by improper mounting, handling, or
lubrication, entry of foreign matter, or abnormal heat
generation.
For instance, the causes of rib scoring, as one example
of premature failure, may include insufficient
lubrication, use of improper lubricant, faulty lubrication
system, entry of foreign matter, bearing mounting
error, excessive deflection of the shaft, or any
combination of these. Thus, it is difficult to determine
the real cause of some premature failures.
If all the conditions at the time of failure and previous
to the time of failure are known, including the
application, the operating conditions, and environment;
then by studying the nature of the failure and its
probable causes, the possibility of similar future
failures can be reduced. The most frequent types of
bearing failure, along with their causes and corrective
actions, are listed in Table 14.3.

LIMITING SPEEDS
The limiting speeds listed in the bearing tables should be adjusted depending
on the bearing load conditions. Also, higher speeds are attainable by making
changes in the lubrication method, cage design, etc. Refer to Page A37 for
detailed information.

Table 2 Standard Cages for Deep Groove Ball Bearings
For deep groove ball bearings, pressed cages are usually used. For big
bearings, machined brass cages are used. (Refer to Table 2)
Machined cages are also used for high speed applications.
MAXIMUM TYPE BALL BEARINGS
Maximum Type Ball Bearings contain a larger number of balls than normal
deep groove ball bearings because of filling slots in the inner and outer rings.
Because of their filling slots, they are not suitable for applications with high axial
loads.
BL2 and BL3 types of bearings have boundary dimensions equal to those of
single-row deep groove ball bearings of Series 62 and 63 respectively. Besides
the open type, ZZ type shielded bearings are also available.
When using these bearings, it is important for the filling slot in the outer ring to
be outside of the loaded zone as much as possible.
Their cages are pressed steel.
MAGNETO BEARINGS
The groove in the inner ring is a little shallower than that of deep groove ball
bearings and one side of the outer ring is relieved. Consequently, the outer ring is
separable, which makes it convenient for mounting.
Pressed cages are standard, but for high speed applications, machined
synthetic resin cages are used.
PRECAUTIONS FOR USE OF DEEP GROOVE BALL BEARINGS
For deep groove ball bearings, if the bearing load is too small during operation,
slippage occurs between the balls and raceways, which may result in smearing.
The higher the weight of balls and cage, the higher this tendency becomes,
especially for large bearings. If very small bearing loads are expected, please
contact NSK for selection of an appropriate bearing.

DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
SINGLE-ROW ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
Since these bearings have a contact angle, they can sustain significant axial
loads in one direction together with radial loads. Because of their design, when
a radial load is applied, an axial force component is produced; therefore, two
opposed bearings or a combination of more than two must be used.
Since the rigidity of single-row angular contact ball bearings can be
increased by preloading, they are often used in the main spindles of machine
tools, for which high running accuracy is required. (Refer to Chapter 10,
Preload, Page A96).
Usually, the cages for angular contact ball bearings with a contact angle of
30° (Symbol A) or 40°(Symbol B) are in accordance with Table 1,but
depending on the application, machined synthetic resin cages or molded
polyamide resin cages are also used. The basic load ratings given in the
bearing tables are based on the cage classification listed in Table 1.
Though the figures in the bearing tables (Pages B50 to B61; bearing bore
diameters of 10 to 120) show bearings with single-shoulder-type inner rings,
both-shoulder-type bearings are also available. Please consult NSK for more
detailed information.
In addition, for bearings with the same serial number, if the type of cages
are different, the number of balls may also be different. In such a case, the
load rating will differ from the one listed in the bearing tables.
Angular Contact Ball Bearings with contact angles of 15° (Symbol C) and
25° (Symbol A5) are primarily for high precision or high speed applications,
and machined brass or synthetic resin cages or molded polyamide cages are
used.
The maximum operating temperature of molded polyamide cages is 120°C.

Table 2 Types and Features of Matched Angular Contact Ball Bearings
MATCHED ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
The types and features of matched angular contact ball bearings are shown
in Table 2.
DOUBLE-ROW ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
This is basically a back-to-back mounting of two single-row angular
contact ball bearings, but their inner and outer rings are each integrated into
one. Axial loads in both directions can be sustained, and the capacity to
sustain moments is good. This type is used as fixed-end bearings.
Their cages are pressed steel.
FOUR-POINT CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
The inner ring is split radially into two pieces. Their design allows one
bearing to sustain significant axial loads in either direction.
The contact angle is 35°, so the axial load capacity is high. This type is
suitable for carrying pure axial loads or combined loads where the axial loads
are high.
The cages are made of machined brass.
PRECAUTIONS FOR USE OF ANGULAR CONTACT BALL
BEARINGS
Under severe operating conditions where the speed and temperature are
close to their limits, lubrication is marginal, vibration and moment loads are
heavy, they may not be suitable, particularly for certain types of cages. In
such a case, please consult with NSK beforehand.
And if the load on angular contact ball bearings becomes too small, or if
the ratio of the axial and radial loads for matched bearings exceeds ‘e’ (e is
listed in the bearings tables) during operation, slippage occurs between the
balls and raceways, which may result in smearing. Especially with large
bearings since the weight of the balls and cage is high. If such load
conditions are expected, please consult with NSK for selection of the
bearings.

INTERNAL CLEARANCES
MATCHED ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS ······Table 9. 17 (Page A94)
Matched angular contact ball bearings with precision better than P5 are
primarily used in the main spindles of machine tools, so they are used with a
preload for rigidity. For convenience of selection, internal clearances are
adjusted to produce Very Light, Light, Medium, and Heavy Preloads. Their
fitting is also special. Concerning these matters, please refer to Tables 10.1
and 10.2 (Pages A98 and A99).
The clearance (or preload) of matched bearings is obtained by axially
tightening a pair of bearings till the side faces of their inner or outer rings are
pressed against each other.
DOUBLE-ROW ANGULAR CONTACT BALL BEARINGS
For the clearance in double-row angular contact ball bearings, please
consult with NSK.
FOUR-POINT CONTACT BALL BEARINGS ·····Table 9.18 (Page A94)
LIMITING SPEEDS
In cases of single-row and matched angular contact ball bearings, the
Limiting speeds listed in the bearing table are for bearings with machined
cage. For those with pressed cages, the listed speeds must be reduced by
20%.
The limiting speeds of bearings with contact angles of 15° (Symbol C) and
25° (Symbol A5) are for bearings with precision of P5 and better (with
machined synthetic-resin cages or molded polyamide cages).
The limiting speeds listed in the bearing tables should be adjusted
depending on the bearing load conditions. Also, higher speeds are attainable
by making changes in the lubrication method, cage design, etc. Refer to Page
A37 for detailed information.

Back-to-back
(DB)
(Example)
7208 A DB
Radial loads and axial loads in both directions
can be sustained.
Since the distance between the effective load
centers a0 is big, this type is suitable if
moments are applied.
Face-to-face
(DF)
(Example)
7208 B DF
Radial loads and axial loads in both directions
can be sustained.
Compared with the DB Type, the distance
between the effective load centers is small, so
the capacity to sustain moments is inferior to
the DB Type.
Tandem
(DT)
(Example)
7208 A DT
Radial loads and axial loads in one direction
can be sustained. Since two bearings share the
axial load, this arrangement is used when the
load in one direction is heavy.

SELF-ALIGNING BALL BEARINGS
SELF-ALIGNING BALL BEARINGS 	Bore Diameter 5 – 110mm ················ B74
DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
The outer ring has a spherical raceway and its center of curvature
coincides with that of the bearing; therefore, the axis of the inner ring, balls
and cage can deflect to some extent around the bearing center. This type is
recommended when the alignment of the shaft and housing is difficult and
when the shaft may bend. Since the contact angle is small, the axial load
capacity is low.
Pressed steel cages are usually used.
PROTRUSION AMOUNT OF BALLS
Among self-aligning ball bearings, there are some in which the balls
protrude from the side face as shown below. This protrusion amount b1 is
listed in the following table.

Table 9.4 (Page A85)
INTERNAL CLEARANCE········································ Table 9.12 (Page A90)
PERMISSIBLE MISALIGNMENT
The permissible misalignment of self-aligning ball bearings is
approximately 0.07 to 0.12 radian (4° to 7°) under normal loads. However,
depending on the surrounding structure, such an angle may not be
possible. Use care in the structural design.

Four-Row Cylindrical Roller Bearings are described on Pages B330 to B339.
DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
Depending on the existence of ribs on their rings, Cylindrical Roller
Bearings are classified into the following types.
Types NU, N, NNU, and NN are suitable as free-end bearings. Types NJ and
NF can sustain limited axial loads in one direction. Types NH and NUP can be
used as fixed-end bearings.
NH-type cylindrical roller bearings consist of the NJ-type cylindrical roller
bearings and HJ-type L-shaped thrust collars (See Page B102 to B105).
The inner ring loose rib of a NUP-type cylindrical roller bearing should be
mounted so that the marked side is on the outside.

B 83	B 82
The basic load ratings listed in the bearing tables are based on the Cage
Classification in Table 1.
For a given bearing number, if the type of cage is not the standard one, the
number of rollers may vary; in such a case, the load rating will differ from the
one listed in the bearing tables.
Among the NN Type of double-row bearings, there are many of high
precision that have tapered bores, and they are primarily used in the main
spindles of machine tools. Their cages are either molded polyphenylenesulfide
(PPS) or machined brass.
PRECAUTIONS FOR USE OF CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
If the load on cylindrical roller bearings becomes too small during operation,
slippage between the rollers and raceways occurs, which may result in
smearing. Especially with large bearings since the weight of the roller and cage
is high.
In case of strong shock loads or vibration, pressed-steel cages are
sometimes inadequate.
If very small bearing load or strong shock loads or vibration are expected,
please consult with NSK for selection of the bearings.
Bearings with molded polyamide cages (ET type) can be used continuously at
temperatures between — 40 and 120°C. If the bearings are used in gear oil,
nonflammable hydraulic oil, or ester oil at a high temperature over 100°C,
please contact NSK beforehand.

PERMISSIBLE MISALIGNMENT
The permissible misalignment of cylindrical roller bearings varies depending
on the type and internal specifications, but under normal loads, the angles are
approximately as follows:
Cylindrical Roller Bearings of width series 0 or 1 ············0.0012 radian (4´)
Cylindrical Roller Bearings of width series 2····················0.0006 radian (2´)
For double-row cylindrical roller bearings, nearly no misalignment is
allowed.
LIMITING SPEEDS
The limiting speeds listed in the bearing tables should be adjusted depending
on the bearing load conditions. Also, higher speeds are attainable by making
changes in the lubrication method, cage design, etc. Refer to Page A37 for
detailed information.

Notes (1) The limiting speeds listed above apply to bearings with machined cages (No suffix). For bearings with pressed cages,
reduce the limiting speed by 20%. (Not applicable to bearing numbers with an EM, EW, or ET suffix.)
(2) The bearings with suffix ET have polyamide cage. The maximum operating temperature should be less than 120 °C.
Notes (3) When L-shaped thrust collars (See section for L-Shaped Thrust Collars starting on page B100) are used, the bearings
become the NH type.
(4) If axial loads are applied, increase da and reduce Da from the values listed above.

Notes (1) The limiting speeds listed above apply to bearings with machined cages (No suffix). For bearings with pressed cages,
reduce the limiting speed by 20%. (Not applicable to bearing numbers with an EM, EW, or ET suffix.)
(2) The bearings with suffix ET have polyamide cage. The maximum operating temperature should be less than 120 °C.
Notes (3) When L-shaped thrust collars (See section for L-Shaped Thrust Collars starting on page B100) are used, the bearings
become the NH type.
(4) If axial loads are applied, increase da and reduce Da from the values listed above.
(5) db (max) are values for adjusting rings for NU, NJ Types.

Notes (1) The limiting speeds listed above apply to bearings with machined cages (No suffix). For bearings with pressed cages,
reduce the limiting speed by 20%. (Not applicable to bearing numbers with an EM, EW, or ET suffix.)
(2) The bearings with suffix ET have polyamide cage. The maximum operating temperature should be less than 120 °C.
Notes (3) When L-shaped thrust collars (See section for L-Shaped Thrust Collars starting on page B100) are used, the bearings
become the NH type.
(4) If axial loads are applied, increase da and reduce Da from the values listed above.
(5) db (max) are values for adjusting rings for NU, NJ Types.

DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
Tapered roller bearings are designed so the apices of the cones formed by
the raceways of the cone and cup and the conical rollers all coincide at one
point on the axis of the bearing. When a radial load is imposed, an axial
force component occurs; therefore, it is necessary to use two bearings in
opposition or some other multiple arrangement.
For metric-design medium-angle and steep-angle tapered roller bearings,
the respective contact angle symbol C or D is added after the bore number.
For normal-angle tapered roller bearings, no contact angle symbol is used.
Medium-angle tapered roller bearings are primarily used for the pinion
shafts of differential gears of automobiles.
Among those with high load capacity(HR series), some bearings have the
basic number suffixed by J to conform to the specifications of ISO for the
cup back face raceway diameter, cup width, and contact angle. Therefore,
the cone assembly and cup of bearings with the same basic number
suffixed by J are internationally interchangeable.
Among metric-design tapered roller bearings specified by ISO 355, there
are those having new dimensions that are different than the dimension
series 3XX used in the past. Part of them are listed in the bearing tables.
They conform to the specifications of ISO for the smaller end diameter of
the cup and contact angle. The cone and cup assemblies are internationally
interchangeable. The bearing number formulation, which is different than
that for past metric design, is as follows:
B 107	B 106

-- 127 of 281 --

Besides metric design tapered roller bearings, there are also inch design
bearings. For the cone assemblies and cups of inch design bearings, except
four-row tapered roller bearings, the bearing numbers are approximately
formulated as follows:
For tapered roller bearings, besides single-row bearings, there are also
various combinations of bearings.
The cages of tapered roller bearings are usually pressed steel.

Example:
Two standard bearings are combined. The bearing clearances
are adjusted by cone spacers or cup spacers. The cones and
cups and spacers are marked with serial numbers and
mating marks. Components with the same serial number can
be assembled referring to the matching symbols.
The KBE type is a back-to-back arrangement of bearings with
the cup and spacer integrated, and the KH type is a face-to-
face arrangement in which the cones are integrated. Since
the bearing clearance is adjusted using spacers, it is
necessary for components to have the same serial number
for assembly with reference to matching symbols.

DIMENSIONS RELATED TO MOUNTING
The dimensions related to mounting tapered roller bearings are listed in the
bearing tables. Since the cages protrude from the ring faces of tapered roller
bearings, please use care when designing shafts and housings.
When heavy axial loads are imposed, the shaft shoulder dimensions and
strength must be sufficient to support the cone rib.
PERMISSIBLE MISALIGNMENT
The permissible misalignment angle for tapered roller bearings is
approximately 0.0009 radian (3´).
LIMITING SPEEDS
The limiting speeds listed in the bearing tables should be adjusted
depending on the bearing load conditions. Also, higher speeds are attainable
by making changes in the lubrication method, cage design, etc. Refer to Page
A37 for detailed information.
PRECAUTIONS FOR USE OF TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
1. If the load on tapered roller bearings becomes too small, or if the ratio of
the axial and radial loads for matched bearings exceeds ‘e’(e is listed in the
bearing tables)during operation, slippage between the rollers and raceways
occurs, which may result in smearing. Especially with large bearings since
the weight of the rollers and cage is high. If such load conditions are
expected, please contact NSK for selection of the bearings.
2. Confirm the dimension of “Abutment and Fillet Dimensions” of Da, Db, Sa,
Sb at the time of the HR series adoption.

DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
Shown in the figures, types EA, C, CD, CA, which are designed for high load capacity,
are available. Types EA, C and CD have pressed steel cages, and type CA has machined
brass cages. Type EA has especially high load capacity, and features such as low torque,
and high strength cage.
An oil groove and holes are provided in the outer ring to supply lubricant and the
bearing numbers are suffixed with E4.
To use bearings with oil grooves and holes, it is recommended to provide an oil groove
in the housing bore, since the depth of the groove in the bearing is limited. The number
and dimensions of the oil groove and holes are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
When bearings with a hole for a locking pin to prevent outer ring rotation are required,
please inform NSK.

PERMISSIBLE MISALIGNMENT
The permissible misalignment of spherical roller bearings varies depending on the size
and load, but it is approximately 0.018 to 0.045 radian (1° to 2.5°) with normal loads.
LIMITING SPEEDS
The limiting speeds listed in the bearing tables should be adjusted depending on the
bearing load conditions. Also, higher speeds are attainable by making changes in the
lubrication method, cage design, etc. Refer to Page A37 for detailed information.
And if the load on spherical roller bearings
becomes too small during operation or if the
ratio of axial and radial loads is larger than
the value of ‘e’(listed in the bearing tables),
slippage occurs between the rollers and
raceways, which may result in smearing. The
higher the weight of the rollers and cage, the
higher this tendency becomes, especially for
large spherical roller bearings.
If very small bearing loads are expected,
please contact NSK for selection of an
appropriate bearing.

DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Thrust ball bearings are classified into those with flat seats or aligning seats
depending on the shape of the outer ring seat (housing washer). They can
sustain axial loads but no radial loads.
The series of thrust ball bearings available are shown in Table 1.
For Single-Direction Thrust Ball Bearings, pressed steel cages and machined
brass cages are usually used as shown in Table 2. The cages in Double-
Direction Thrust Ball Bearings are the same as those in Single-Direction Thrust
Ball Bearings of the same diameter series.
The basic load ratings listed in the bearing tables are based on the standard
cage type shown in Table 2. If the type of cage is different for bearings with the
same number, the number of balls may vary, in such a case, the load rating
will differ from the one listed in the bearing tables.

CYLINDRICAL ROLLER THRUST BEARINGS
These are thrust bearings containing cylindrical rollers. They can sustain
only axial loads, but they are suitable for heavy loads and have high axial
rigidity.
The cages are machined brass.
SPHERICAL THRUST ROLLER BEARINGS
These are thrust bearings containing convex rollers. They have a self-
aligning capability and are free of any influence of mounting error or shaft
deflection. Besides the original type, the E type with pressed cages for high
load capacity is also available. Their bearing numbers are suffixed by E.
For horizontal shaft or high speed application, machined brass cages are
recommended. For details, contact NSK.
Since there are several places where lubrication is difficult, such as the area
between the roller heads and inner ring rib, the sliding surfaces between cage
and guide sleeve, etc., oil lubrication should be used even at low speed.
The cages in the original type are machined brass.

DIMENSIONS RELATED TO MOUNTING
The dimensions related to mounting of spherical thrust roller bearings are
listed in the Bearing Table.
If the bearing load is heavy, it is necessary to design the shaft shoulder
with ample strength in order to provide sufficient support for the shaft
washer.
PERMISSIBLE MISALIGNMENT
The permissible misalignment of Spherical Thrust Roller Bearings varies
depending on the size, but it is approximately 0.018 to 0.036 radian (1° to
2°) with average loads.
MINIMUM AXIAL LOAD
It is necessary to apply some axial load to thrust bearings to prevent
slippage between the rolling elements and raceways. For more details, please
refer to Page A99.

BALL BEARINGS FOR BALL SCREWS 	Bore Diameter 15 – 60mm························· B238
DESIGN, TYPE, AND FEATURES
DOUBLE-DIRECTION ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS
Double-Direction Angular Contact Thrust Ball Bearings are specially designed
high precision bearings for the main spindles of machine tools.
Compared with the Thrust Ball Bearings in the 511 Series, this type contains
more balls of smaller diameter and has a contact angle of 60°. Consequently,
the influence of centrifugal force is less and they can withstand higher speed
and have higher rigidity.
Bearings in Series 20 and 29 have the same inner and outer diameters as the
double-row cylindrical roller bearings in Series NN30 and NN49 respectively,
and they are both used for high axial loads.
Their cages are machined brass.
There are the BTR, BAR Series of highly rigid angular contact ball bearings
suitable for high speed that can be easily replaced by these double- direction
angular contact ball bearings. For more details, please contact NSK.
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS FOR BALL SCREWS
Bearings of this type were specially designed to support NSK Precision Ball
Screws. They are usually used in combinations of more than two bearings and
with a preload. Their contact angle is 60°. For more details, please refer to
Catalog CAT. No. E1254 SUPER PRECISION BEARINGS.
Their cages are molded polyamide.

RECOMMENDED FITS
DOUBLE-DIRECTION ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS
The shaft washer and shaft should be in soft contact with neither interference
nor clearance, and the housing washer and housing bore should be loosely
fitted. For a bearing arrangement with a double-row cylindrical roller bearing,
the tolerances for the outside diameter should be f6 to produce a loose fit.
ANGULAR CONTACT THRUST BALL BEARINGS FOR BALL SCREWS
A tolerance of h5 is recommended for shafts and H6 for housing bores.
INTERNAL CLEARANCE AND PRELOAD
In order to produce an appropriate preload on bearings when they are
mounted, the following axial internal clearances are recommended.

Note (1) 	When using a cylinder instead of an inner ring,
Fwmin is the diameter of the cylinder at which the
internal clearance is zero in at least one radial
direction. (Fwmin is the minimum diameter of
each inscribed circle diameter where deviation is
assumed.)
Remarks To measure the roller inscribed circle diameter,
use the following plug gauges:
GO gauge: The same dimensions as the
minimum tolerance of the roller
inscribed circle diameter Fwmin.
NO-GO gauge: The dimensions should be the
maximum tolerance of roller
inscribed circle diameter, Fwmin,
plus 0.002mm.
Table1 Types of Needle Roller Bearings
DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY · RUNNING ACCURACY
DRAWN CUP NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS
The correct form and dimensional accuracy of outer ring of drawn cup
needle roller bearing is achieved only by press fitting into proper housing with
appropriate interference. Therefore, roller inscribed circle diameter is measured
after press fitted into a standard ring gauge.
The dimension of ring gauge and tolerance of roller inscribed circle diameter
are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

RECOMMENDED FITTING AND BEARING INTERNAL CLEARANCE
CAGE & NEEDLE ROLLER ASSEMBLIES
Recommended fitting of cage & roller under typical operating condition is
shown in Table 5. 	By combining cage & roller, shaft, and housing,
appropriate radial internal clearance is obtained. 	However, the fitting and
the radial internal clearance of cage & roller for connecting rod should be
determined by the type of engine, characteristic, and driving condition etc..

For FJ, FJH, and MFJH types and F, FH, and MFH types, if tolerance of
fitting such as shaft:h6, and housing bore:N7 (in case of thick steel
housing), are applied under general operating condition, appropriate radial
internal clearance is obtained. In case that outer ring rotation, the fitting of
shaft : f6, housing bore : R7, and light alloy housing or steel housing of less
than 6mm thickness, the housing bore should be smaller than N7 by 0.013

However, for needle roller bearing of wider bearing width, and with long
needle rollers, bearings with CN clearance are not necessarily common, but
large clearance is selected frequently. For the solid needle roller bearing
without inner ring, it is possible to select radial internal clearance shown in
Table 6 by selecting tolerance class of shaft, which is fitting to the bearing.
THRUST NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS
Recommended Fitting of Thrust Needle Roller Bearings and Thrust Raceway are shown in
Table 7.
Units mm
Note (1 ) Dc represents outside diameter of the cage.
Remarks If the cage is guided by outside diameter, to prevent the wear of housing
bore, it is necessary to harden the surface at least.

CAM FOLLOWERS · ROLLER FOLLOWERS
The recommended fittings for the mounting area of cam follower studs are
shown in Table 8. Recommended shaft fittings of roller follower are shown
in Table 9.
Since cam followers are used with cantilevered mounting, they should be
fixed with little clearance of the fitting surface as much as possible.
Since a roller follower is generally used with outer ring rotation, the fitting
with shaft is transition or loose fit. In case that heavy loads impose to the
roller follower, it is recommended to use the shaft of quench hardening
treatment, and with tight fit.
For the details, please refer to specified catalog.

SHAFT AND HOUSING SPECIFICATIONS
The specification of shaft and housing for radial needle roller bearings,
which are used under general operating condition, is shown in Table 10.
LIMITING INCLINATION ANGLES
The limiting inclination angle of radial needle roller bearing under general
load condition is 0.001 radian (3.4') approximately. For the detail, please
refer to specified catalog.,
PERMISSBLE TRACK LOAD
The permissble load of the track is determined by compression strength or
hardness. The permissble load of the track shown in the bearing table is value
of a track made of steel with a hardness of HRC40. Table 12 indicates the
permissible load coefficient of the track for each hardness.
The permissible load of the track for each hardness can be obtained by
multiplying the permissible load coefficient of the track corresponding to each
hardness.
PRE-PACKED GREASE
The cam follower/roller follower with a seal is pre-lubricated with lithium
soap-based grease. The range of operating temperature is –10 to +110°C.
For the cam follower/roller follower without seal, please lubricate with
suitable lubricant.
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE LOAD AND MAXIMUM CLAMP TORQUE
OF CAM FOLLOWERS.
The maximum radial Load that the cam follower can carry is determined
by the bearing strengh and shear strengh of the stud rather than the Load
rating for neele bearings. This value is given in the bearing table as the
maximum permissible Load.
Since the stud of the cam follower receives bending stress and tensile
stress from the bearing Load, the screw clamp torque should not exceed
the value shown in the bearing table.
LIMITING SPEED
The limiting speeds of bearings are shown in bearing tables. However,
depending on load condition of the bearing, the limiting speeds are
necessary to compensate. Also, improvement of lubrication method allows
to take higher limiting speed. For the detail, please refer to A37 page.
Specifications of Thrust Bearings Raceway Surface are shown in Table 11.
Remarks 1. For the specification of shaft and housing of cage & needle roller assembly for
connecting rod, please refer to specified catalog.
2. These are general recommendation by radius method. For the value of
standard tolerance (IT), please refer to Appendix 11 (page C22)

B 279	B 278
The NSK bearing unit is a combination of a radial
ball bearing, seal, and a housing of high-grade cast
iron or pressed steel, which comes in various shapes.
The outer surface of the bearing and the internal
surface of the housing are spherical, so that the unit
is self-aligning.
The inside construction of the ball bearing for the
unit is such that steel balls and retainers of the same
type as in series 62 and 63 of the deep groove ball
bearing are used. A duplex seal consisting of a
combination of an oil-proof synthetic rubber seal and
a slinger is provided on both sides.
Depending on the type, the following methods of
fitting to the shaft are employed:
(1) The inner ring is fastened onto the shaft in two
places by set screws.
(2) The inner ring has a tapered bore and is fitted to
the shaft by means of an adapter.
(3) In the eccentric locking collar system the inns
ring is fastened to the shaft by means of
eccentrics grooves provided at the side of the
inner ring and on the collar.
1. CONSTRUCTION
2.1 MAINTENANCE FREE TYPE
The NSK Maintenance free bearing unit contains a
high-grade lithium-based grease, good for use over a
long period, which is ideally suited to sealed-type
bearing. Also provided is an excellent sealing device,
which prevents any leakage of grease or penetration
of dust and water from outside.
It is designed so that the rotation of the shaft
causes the sealed-in grease to circulate through the
inside space, effectively providing maximum
lubrication. The lubrication effect is maintained over a
long period with no need for replenishment of grease.
To summarize the advantages of the NSK
maintenance free bearing unit:
(1) As an adequate amount of good quality grease is
sealed in at the time of manufacture, there is no
need for replenishment. This means savings in
terms of time and maintenance costs.
(2) Since there is no need for any regreasing facilities,
such as piping, a more compact design is
possible.
(3) The sealed-in design eliminates the possibility of
grease leakage, which could lead to stained
products.
2.2 RELUBRICATABLE TYPE
The NSK relubricatable type bearing unit has an
advantage over other similar, units being so designed
as to permit regreasing even in the case of
misalignment of 2° to the right or left. The hole
through which the grease fitting is mounted usually
causes structural weakening of the housing.
However, as a result of extensive testing, in the
NSK bearing unit the hole is positioned so as to
minimize this adverse effect. In addition, the
regreasing groove has been designed to minimize
weakening of the housing.
While the NSK maintenance free type bearing unit
is satisfactory for use under normal operating
conditions in-doors, in the following circumstances it
is necessary to use the relubricatable type bearing
unit:
(1) Cases where the temperature of the bearing rises
above 100°C, 212°F:
*-Normal temperature of up to 200°C, 392°F
heat-resistant bearing units.
(2) Cases where there is excessive dust, but space
does not permit using a bearing unit with a cover.
(3) Cases where the bearing unit is constantly
exposed to splashes of water or any other liquid,
but space does not permit using a bearing unit
with a cover.
(4) Cases in which the humidity is very high, and the
machine in which the bearing unit is used is run
only intermittently.
(5) Cases involving a heavy load of which the Cr/Pr
value is about 10 or below, and the speed is 10
min–1 or below, or the movement is oscillatory.
(6) Cases where the number of revolutions is
relatively high and the noise problem has to be
considered; for example, when the bearing is used
with the fan of an air conditioner.
2.3 SPECIAL SEALING FEATURE
2.3.1 STANDARD BEARING UNITS
The sealing device of the ball bearing for the NSK
bearing unit is a combination of a heat-resistant and
oil-proof synthetic rubber seal and a slinger of an
exclusive design.
The seal, which is fixed in the outer ring, is
steel-reinforced, and its lip, in contact with the inner
ring, is designed to minimize frictional torque.
The slinger is fixed to the inner ring of the bearing
with which it rotates. There is a small clearance
between its periphery and the outer ring.
There are triangular protrusions on the outside face
of the slinger and, as the bearing rotates, these
protrusions on the slinger create a flow of air outward
from the bearing. In this way, the slinger acts as a fan
which-keeps dust and water away from the bearing.
These two types of seals on both sides of the
bearing prevent grease leakage, and foreign matter is
prevented from entering the bearing from outside.

2.3.2 BEARING UNITS WITH COVERS
The NSK bearing unit with a cover consists of a
standard bearing unit and an outside covering for
extra protection against dust. Special consideration
has been given to its design with respect to dust-
proofing.
Sealing devices are provided in both the bearing
and the housing, so that units of this type operate
satisfactorily even in such adverse environments as
flour mills, steel mills, foundries, galvanizing plants
and chemical plants, where excessive dust is
produced and/or liquids are used. They are also
eminently suitable for outdoor environments where
dust and rain are inevitable, and in heavy industrial
machinery such as construction and transportation
equipment.
The rubber seal of the cover contacts with the shaft
by its two lips, as shown in Fig. 2.2 and 2.3. By
filling the groove between the two lips with grease,
an excellent sealing effect is obtained and, at the
same time, the contacting portions of the lips are
lubricated. Furthermore, the groove is so designed
that when the shaft is inclined the rubber seal can
move in the radial direction.
When bearing units are exposed to splashes of
water rather than to dust, a drain hole (5 to 8 mm,
0.2 to 0.3 inches in diameter)is provided at the
bottom of the cover, and grease should be applied
to the side of the bearing itself instead of into the
cover.
2.4 SECURE FITTING
Fastening the bearing to the shaft is effected by
tightening the ball-end set screw, situated on the
inner ring. This is a unique feature which prevents
loosening, even if the bearing is subject to intense
vibrations and shocks.
2.5 SELF-ALIGNING
With the NSK bearing unit, the outer surface of
the ball bearing and the inner surface of the housing
are spherical, thus this bearing unit has self-aligning
characteristic. Any misalignment of axis that arise
from poor workmanship on the shaft or errors in
fitting will be properly adjusted.
2.6 HIGHER RATED LOAD CAPACITY
The bearing used in the unit is of the same internal
construction as those in bearing series 62 and 63,
and is capable of accommodating axial load as well
as radial load, or composite load. The rated load
capacity or this bearing is considerably higher than
that of the corresponding self-aligning ball bearings
used for standard plummer blocks
2.7 LIGHT WEIGHT YET STRONG HOUSING
Housings for NSK bearing units come in various
shapes. They consist of either high-grade cast iron,
one-piece casting, or of precision finished pressed
steel, the latter being lighter in weight. In either
case, they are practically designed to combine
lightness with maximum strength.
2.8 EASY MOUNTING
The NSK bearing unit is an integrated unit
consisting of a bearing and a housing.
As the bearing is prelubricated at manufacture with
the correct amount of high-grade lithium base, it can
be mounted on the shaft just as it is. It is sufficient
to carry out a short test run after mounting.
2.9 ACCURATE FITTING OF THE HOUSING
In order to simplify the fitting of the pillow block
and flange type bearing units, the housings are
provided with a seat for a dowel pin, which may be
utilized as needed.
2.10 BEARING REPLACEABILITY
The bearing used in the NSK bearing unit is
replaceable. In the event of bearing failure, a new
bearing can be fitted to the existing housing.

DESIGN, TYPES AND FEATURES
There are numerous types and sizes of plummer blocks. In this catalog, only the types
marked by 	are shown.
SN 5
SN 6
SN 30
SN 31
SN 2
SN 3
SN 2C
SN 3C
These are the most common type.
Models SN30 and SN31 are for medium
loads.
For types SN2C and SN3C, the bore
diameters on the two sides are different.
SD 30S
SD 31S
SD 5
SD 6
SD 2
SD 3
SD 2C
SD 3C
These are large and made for heavy loads.
The standard ones have double seals and
four mounting bolt holes. For types SD2C
and SD3C, the bore diameters on the two
sides are different.
SG 5
Dustproof plummer blocks have a
combination of oil seals, labyrinth seals, and
oil groove seals, therefore, they are suitable
for environments with much dust and other
foreign matter.
SD31TS
SD32TS
These are provided with labyrinth seals, so
they are suitable for high speed applications.
V · C
Single-piece plummer blocks
(integrated type roller bearing unit)have
higher rigidity and precision than split type
plummer blocks.
SN 5B
SN 6B
SN 30B
SN 31B
SN 2B
SN 3B
SN 2BC
SN 3BC
These have the same dimensions as those
of types SN5 and SN6. To increase the
bearing box strength, no material is
removed from the top or bottom of the base,
so mounting holes can be drilled anywhere.

CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS FOR SHEAVES

Prelubricated Type 	Bore Diameter 40 – 400mm ································ B328
DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
Cylindrical Roller Bearings for sheaves are specially designed thin-walled,
broad-width, full-complement type double-row cylindrical roller bearings, but
they are widely used also for general industrial machines running at low speed
and under heavy loads. There are several series as shown in Table 1.
Since all are non-separable type bearings, the inner and outer rings cannot
be separated, but the RSF type can be used as a free-end bearing. In this case,
the permissible axial displacement is listed in the bearing tables.
Since cylindrical roller bearings for sheaves are a double-row, full-
complement type, they can withstand heavy shock loads and moments and
have sufficient axial load capacity for use in sheaves.
Since the shielded type is a kind of bearing unit, the number of parts
surrounding the bearing can be reduced, so it allows for a simple compact
design.
The surface of these bearings is treated for rust prevention.
TOLERANCES AND
RUNNING ACCURACY ······························· Table 8.2 (Pages A60 to A63)
RECOMMENDED FITS AND INTERNAL CLEARANGES
When used with outer ring rotation for sheaves or wheels, the fit and radial
internal clearance should conform to Table 2.
The fits listed in Tables 9.2 (Page A84) and 9.4 (Page A85) apply when they
are used with inner ring rotation in general applications, and the internal
clearance should conform to Table 3.

DESIGN, TYPES, AND FEATURES
Four-row tapered roller bearings and four-row cylindrical roller bearings
used for rolling-mill roll necks are easy to service and check, and are designed
to have the highest load rating possible for the limited space around roll
necks. Also, they are designed for high speed to satisfy the demand for fast
rolling.
In addition to the open type (KV) four-row tapered roller bearings listed in
this catalog, sealed-clean type four-row tapered roller bearings are also
available. Please refer to “Large-Size Rolling Bearings” catalog (CAT. No.
E125) or “Extra-Capacity Sealed-CleanTM Roll Neck Bearings” catalog (CAT.
No. E1225) for more detailed information.

FOUR-ROW CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS (CYLINDRICAL BORES)
When they are used on backup rolls of four stage rolling mills, the tolerances for roll
neck diameters are shown in Table 5. For the fitting between the bearing and chock
bore, we recommend G7.
For the fitting of four-row cylindrical roller bearings on the roll necks of other rolling
mills, Table 9.2 (Page A84) and Table 9.4 (Page A85) usually apply.
INTERNAL CLEARANCES
FOUR-ROW TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS
The radial internal clearances in four-row tapered roller bearings (cylindrical bores)
used on rolling mill roll necks with a loose fit are C2 or often smaller than C2. The
NSK standard clearances for four-row tapered roller bearings for roll necks are
shown in Table 6. Depending on the operating conditions, special radial clearance
selection may become necessary, please contact NSK in such a case.
The internal clearance in four-row tapered roller bearings is peadjusted for individual
bearing sets, therefore it is necessary to use each part of a given set by observing
mating marks when assembling them.
FOUR-ROW CYLINDRICAL ROLLER BEARINGS
Please contact NSK regarding internal clearance.

Railway Rolling Stock Bearings
Railway rolling stock bearings are important components of rolling stocks that require high
reliability.
The main bearings consist of axle bearings that are mounted at both ends of axle and
support the entire weight of the rolling stock. Additionally, there are railway traction motor
bearings that are used for the motor that drives the axle; and gear unit bearings that transfer
the power from the motor to the axle. NSK has designed and manufactured specific bearings
for these very applications.
Types and Features
Axle Bearings
• 	Axle bearings consist of the following types of bearings to meet operator demands for
high-speed capability of rolling stock, weight reductions, and minimal maintenance and
inspection requirements:
➣ Cylindrical roller bearings with a thrust collar (oil bath lubrication, grease lubrication)
➣ Tapered roller bearings (oil bath lubrication)
➣ RCC Bearings (sealed-clean rotating end cap cylindrical roller bearings) (grease
lubrication)
➣ RCT bearings (sealed-clean rotating end cap tapered roller bearings) (grease
lubrication)
• 	NSK has been approved by AAR (Association of American Railroads).
Traction Motor Bearings
• 	Bearings for inverter controlled AC motors are speciality designed to meet high-speed
specifications and requirements for ensuring dimensional stability. NSK recommends long-
life grease for these bearings.
• 	NSK offers the following bearings as a measure against electric erosion, which occurs
when electric current is allowed to flow through the motor bearings:
➣ Ceramic-insulated bearings (ceramic-coated bearings) and PPS-insulated bearings
• 	High capacity bearings also available for locomotive-type large traction motors
Gear Unit Bearings
• 	These bearings are designed to meet high-speed specifications and offer excellent seizure
resistance.
• 	A reinforced cage has been adopted for these bearings.

Appendix Table 2 N-kgf Conversion Table
[Method of using this table] For example, to convert 10N into kgf, read the figure in the right kgf
column adjacent to the 10 in the center column in the 1st block. This
means that 10N is 1.0197kgf. To convert 10kgf into N, read the figure
in the left N column of the same row, which indicates that the answer
is 98.066N.
1 N=0.1019716 kgf
1 kgf=9.80665 N
Appendix Table 3 kg-lb Conversion Table
[Method of using this table] For example, to convert 10kg into lb, read the figure in the right lb
column adjacent to the 10 in the center column in the 1st block. This
means that 10kg is 22.046lb. To convert 10lb into kg, read the figure
in the left kg column of the same row, which indicates that the answer
is 4.536kg.

Appendix Table 4 °C-°F 	Conversion Table 	Appendix Table 5 Viscosity Conversion Table
[Method of using this table] For example, to convert 38°C into °F, read the figure in the right °F
column adjacent to the 38 in the center column in the 2nd block. This
means that 38°C is 100.4°F. To convert 38°F into°C, read the figure
in the left °C column of the same row, which indicates that the answer
is 3.3°C.
